either 'GOTO_EXPR' or 'RETURN_EXPR'.

 The operand of a 'GOTO_EXPR' must be either a label or a variable
containing the address to jump to.

 The operand of a 'RETURN_EXPR' is either 'NULL_TREE', 'RESULT_DECL', or
a 'MODIFY_EXPR' which sets the return value.  It would be nice to move
the 'MODIFY_EXPR' into a separate statement, but the special return
semantics in 'expand_return' make that difficult.  It may still happen
in the future, perhaps by moving most of that logic into
'expand_assignment'.

10.7.6 Cleanups
---------------

Destructors for local C++ objects and similar dynamic cleanups are
represented in GIMPLE by a 'TRY_FINALLY_EXPR'.  'TRY_FINALLY_EXPR' has
two operands, both of which are a sequence of statements to execute.
The first sequence is executed.  When it completes the second sequence
is executed.

 The first sequence may complete in the following ways:

  1. Execute the last statement in the sequence and fall off the end.

  2. Execute a goto statement ('GOTO_EXPR') to an ordinary label outside
     the sequence.

  3. Execute a return statement ('RETURN_EXPR').

  4. Throw an exception.  This is currently not explicitly represented
     in GIMPLE.

 The second sequence is not executed if the first sequence completes by
calling 'setjmp' or 'exit' or any other function that does not return.
The second sequence is also not executed if the first sequence completes
via a non-local goto or a computed goto (in general the compiler does
not know whether such a goto statement exits the first sequence or not,
so we assume that it doesn't).

 After the second sequence is executed, if it completes normally by
falling off the end, execution continues wherever the first sequence
would have continued, by falling off the end, or doing a goto, etc.

 'TRY_FINALLY_EXPR' complicates the flow graph, since the cleanup needs
to appear on every edge out of the controlled block; this reduces the
freedom to move code across these edges.  Therefore, the EH lowering
pass which runs before most of the optimization passes eliminates these
expressions by explicitly adding the cleanup to each edge.  Rethrowing
the exception is represented using 'RESX_EXPR'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: OpenMP,  Prev: Cleanups,  Up: Statements

10.7.7 OpenMP
-------------

All the statements starting with 'OMP_' represent directives and clauses
used by the OpenMP API <http://www.openmp.org/>.

'OMP_PARALLEL'

     Represents '#pragma omp parallel [clause1 ... clauseN]'.  It has
     four operands:

     Operand 'OMP_PARALLEL_BODY' is valid while in GENERIC and High
     GIMPLE forms.  It contains the body of code to be executed by all
     the threads.  During GIMPLE lowering, this operand becomes 'NULL'
     and the body is emitted linearly after 'OMP_PARALLEL'.

     Operand 'OMP_PARALLEL_CLAUSES' is the list of clauses associated
     with the directive.

     Operand 'OMP_PARALLEL_FN' is created by 'pass_lower_omp', it
     contains the 'FUNCTION_DECL' for the function that will contain the
     body of the parallel region.

     Operand 'OMP_PARALLEL_DATA_ARG' is also created by
     'pass_lower_omp'.  If there are shared variables to be communicated
     to the children threads, this operand will contain the 'VAR_DECL'
     that contains all the shared values and variables.

'OMP_FOR'

     Represents '#pragma omp for [clause1 ... clauseN]'.  It has 5
     operands:

     Operand 'OMP_FOR_BODY' contains the loop body.

     Operand 'OMP_FOR_CLAUSES' is the list of clauses associated with
     the directive.

     Operand 'OMP_FOR_INIT' is the loop initialization code of the form
     'VAR = N1'.

     Operand 'OMP_FOR_COND' is the loop conditional expression of the
     form 'VAR {<,>,<=,>=} N2'.

     Operand 'OMP_FOR_INCR' is the loop index increment of the form 'VAR
     {+=,-=} INCR'.

     Operand 'OMP_FOR_PRE_BODY' contains side-effect code from operands
     'OMP_FOR_INIT', 'OMP_FOR_COND' and 'OMP_FOR_INC'.  These
     side-effects are part of the 'OMP_FOR' block but must be evaluated
     before the start of loop body.

     The loop index variable 'VAR' must be a signed integer variable,
     which is implicitly private to each thread.  Bounds 'N1' and 'N2'
     and the increment expression 'INCR' are required to be loop
     invariant integer expressions that are evaluated without any
     synchronization.  The evaluation order, frequency of evaluation and
     side-effects are unspecified by the standard.

'OMP_SECTIONS'

     Represents '#pragma omp sections [clause1 ... clauseN]'.

     Operand 'OMP_SECTIONS_BODY' contains the sections body, which in
     turn contains a set of 'OMP_SECTION' nodes for each of the
     concurrent sections delimited by '#pragma omp section'.

     Operand 'OMP_SECTIONS_CLAUSES' is the list of clauses associated
     with the directive.

'OMP_SECTION'

     Section delimiter for 'OMP_SECTIONS'.

'OMP_SINGLE'

     Represents '#pragma omp single'.

     Operand 'OMP_SINGLE_BODY' contains the body of code to be executed
     by a single thread.

     Operand 'OMP_SINGLE_CLAUSES' is the list of clauses associated with
     the directive.

'OMP_MASTER'

     Represents '#pragma omp master'.

     Operand 'OMP_MASTER_BODY' contains the body of code to be executed
     by the master thread.

'OMP_ORDERED'

     Represents '#pragma omp ordered'.

     Operand 'OMP_ORDERED_BODY' contains the body of code to be executed
     in the sequential order dictated by the loop index variable.

'OMP_CRITICAL'

     Represents '#pragma omp critical [name]'.

     Operand 'OMP_CRITICAL_BODY' is the critical section.

     Operand 'OMP_CRITICAL_NAME' is an optional identifier to label the
     critical section.

'OMP_RETURN'

     This does not represent any OpenMP directive, it is an artificial
     marker to indicate the end of the body of an OpenMP.  It is used by
     the flow graph ('tree-cfg.c') and OpenMP region building code
     ('omp-low.c').

'OMP_CONTINUE'

     Similarly, this instruction does not represent an OpenMP directive,
     it is used by 'OMP_FOR' and 'OMP_SECTIONS' to mark the place where
     the code needs to loop to the next iteration (in the case of
     'OMP_FOR') or the next section (in the case of 'OMP_SECTIONS').

     In some cases, 'OMP_CONTINUE' is placed right before 'OMP_RETURN'.
     But if there are cleanups that need to occur right after the
     looping body, it will be emitted between 'OMP_CONTINUE' and
     'OMP_RETURN'.

'OMP_ATOMIC'

     Represents '#pragma omp atomic'.

     Operand 0 is the address at which the atomic operation is to be
     performed.

     Operand 1 is the expression to evaluate.  The gimplifier tries
     three alternative code generation strategies.  Whenever possible,
     an atomic update built-in is used.  If that fails, a
     compare-and-swap loop is attempted.  If that also fails, a regular
     critical section around the expression is used.

'OMP_CLAUSE'

     Represents clauses associated with one of the 'OMP_' directives.
     Clauses are represented by separate subcodes defined in 'tree.h'.
     Clauses codes can be one of: 'OMP_CLAUSE_PRIVATE',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_SHARED', 'OMP_CLAUSE_FIRSTPRIVATE',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_LASTPRIVATE', 'OMP_CLAUSE_COPYIN',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_COPYPRIVATE', 'OMP_CLAUSE_IF',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_NUM_THREADS', 'OMP_CLAUSE_SCHEDULE',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_NOWAIT', 'OMP_CLAUSE_ORDERED', 'OMP_CLAUSE_DEFAULT',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_REDUCTION', 'OMP_CLAUSE_COLLAPSE', 'OMP_CLAUSE_UNTIED',
     'OMP_CLAUSE_FINAL', and 'OMP_CLAUSE_MERGEABLE'.  Each code
     represents the corresponding OpenMP clause.

     Clauses associated with the same directive are chained together via
     'OMP_CLAUSE_CHAIN'.  Those clauses that accept a list of variables
     are restricted to exactly one, accessed with 'OMP_CLAUSE_VAR'.
     Therefore, multiple variables under the same clause 'C' need to be
     represented as multiple 'C' clauses chained together.  This
     facilitates adding new clauses during compilation.

10.8 Functions
==============

A function is represented by a 'FUNCTION_DECL' node.  It stores the
basic pieces of the function such as body, parameters, and return type
as well as information on the surrounding context, visibility, and
linkage.

* Menu:

* Function Basics::     Function names, body, and parameters.
* Function Properties:: Context, linkage, etc.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Function Basics,  Next: Function Properties,  Up: Functions

10.8.1 Function Basics
----------------------

A function has four core parts: the name, the parameters, the result,
and the body.  The following macros and functions access these parts of
a 'FUNCTION_DECL' as well as other basic features:
'DECL_NAME'
     This macro returns the unqualified name of the function, as an
     'IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  For an instantiation of a function template,
     the 'DECL_NAME' is the unqualified name of the template, not
     something like 'f<int>'.  The value of 'DECL_NAME' is undefined
     when used on a constructor, destructor, overloaded operator, or
     type-conversion operator, or any function that is implicitly
     generated by the compiler.  See below for macros that can be used
     to distinguish these cases.

'DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME'
     This macro returns the mangled name of the function, also an
     'IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  This name does not contain leading underscores
     on systems that prefix all identifiers with underscores.  The
     mangled name is computed in the same way on all platforms; if
     special processing is required to deal with the object file format
     used on a particular platform, it is the responsibility of the back
     end to perform those modifications.  (Of course, the back end
     should not modify 'DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' itself.)

     Using 'DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' will cause additional memory to be
     allocated (for the mangled name of the entity) so it should be used
     only when emitting assembly code.  It should not be used within the
     optimizers to determine whether or not two declarations are the
     same, even though some of the existing optimizers do use it in that
     way.  These uses will be removed over time.

'DECL_ARGUMENTS'
     This macro returns the 'PARM_DECL' for the first argument to the
     function.  Subsequent 'PARM_DECL' nodes can be obtained by
     following the 'TREE_CHAIN' links.

'DECL_RESULT'
     This macro returns the 'RESULT_DECL' for the function.

'DECL_SAVED_TREE'
     This macro returns the complete body of the function.

'TREE_TYPE'
     This macro returns the 'FUNCTION_TYPE' or 'METHOD_TYPE' for the
     function.

'DECL_INITIAL'
     A function that has a definition in the current translation unit
     will have a non-'NULL' 'DECL_INITIAL'.  However, back ends should
     not make use of the particular value given by 'DECL_INITIAL'.

     It should contain a tree of 'BLOCK' nodes that mirrors the scopes
     that variables are bound in the function.  Each block contains a
     list of decls declared in a basic block, a pointer to a chain of
     blocks at the next lower scope level, then a pointer to the next
     block at the same level and a backpointer to the parent 'BLOCK' or
     'FUNCTION_DECL'.  So given a function as follows:

          void foo()
          {
            int a;
            {
              int b;
            }
            int c;
          }

     you would get the following:

          tree foo = FUNCTION_DECL;
          tree decl_a = VAR_DECL;
          tree decl_b = VAR_DECL;
          tree decl_c = VAR_DECL;
          tree block_a = BLOCK;
          tree block_b = BLOCK;
          tree block_c = BLOCK;
          BLOCK_VARS(block_a) = decl_a;
          BLOCK_SUBBLOCKS(block_a) = block_b;
          BLOCK_CHAIN(block_a) = block_c;
          BLOCK_SUPERCONTEXT(block_a) = foo;
          BLOCK_VARS(block_b) = decl_b;
          BLOCK_SUPERCONTEXT(block_b) = block_a;
          BLOCK_VARS(block_c) = decl_c;
          BLOCK_SUPERCONTEXT(block_c) = foo;
          DECL_INITIAL(foo) = block_a;

10.8.2 Function Properties
--------------------------

To determine the scope of a function, you can use the 'DECL_CONTEXT'
macro.  This macro will return the class (either a 'RECORD_TYPE' or a
'UNION_TYPE') or namespace (a 'NAMESPACE_DECL') of which the function is
a member.  For a virtual function, this macro returns the class in which
the function was actually defined, not the base class in which the
virtual declaration occurred.

 In C, the 'DECL_CONTEXT' for a function maybe another function.  This
representation indicates that the GNU nested function extension is in
use.  For details on the semantics of nested functions, see the GCC
Manual.  The nested function can refer to local variables in its
containing function.  Such references are not explicitly marked in the
tree structure; back ends must look at the 'DECL_CONTEXT' for the
referenced 'VAR_DECL'.  If the 'DECL_CONTEXT' for the referenced
'VAR_DECL' is not the same as the function currently being processed,
and neither 'DECL_EXTERNAL' nor 'TREE_STATIC' hold, then the reference
is to a local variable in a containing function, and the back end must
take appropriate action.

'DECL_EXTERNAL'
     This predicate holds if the function is undefined.

'TREE_PUBLIC'
     This predicate holds if the function has external linkage.

'TREE_STATIC'
     This predicate holds if the function has been defined.

'TREE_THIS_VOLATILE'
     This predicate holds if the function does not return normally.

'TREE_READONLY'
     This predicate holds if the function can only read its arguments.

'DECL_PURE_P'
     This predicate holds if the function can only read its arguments,
     but may also read global memory.

'DECL_VIRTUAL_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is virtual.

'DECL_ARTIFICIAL'
     This macro holds if the function was implicitly generated by the
     compiler, rather than explicitly declared.  In addition to
     implicitly generated class member functions, this macro holds for
     the special functions created to implement static initialization
     and destruction, to compute run-time type information, and so
     forth.

'DECL_FUNCTION_SPECIFIC_TARGET'
     This macro returns a tree node that holds the target options that
     are to be used to compile this particular function or 'NULL_TREE'
     if the function is to be compiled with the target options specified
     on the command line.

'DECL_FUNCTION_SPECIFIC_OPTIMIZATION'
     This macro returns a tree node that holds the optimization options
     that are to be used to compile this particular function or
     'NULL_TREE' if the function is to be compiled with the optimization
     options specified on the command line.

10.9 Language-dependent trees
=============================

Front ends may wish to keep some state associated with various GENERIC
trees while parsing.  To support this, trees provide a set of flags that
may be used by the front end.  They are accessed using
'TREE_LANG_FLAG_n' where 'n' is currently 0 through 6.

 If necessary, a front end can use some language-dependent tree codes in
its GENERIC representation, so long as it provides a hook for converting
them to GIMPLE and doesn't expect them to work with any (hypothetical)
optimizers that run before the conversion to GIMPLE.  The intermediate
representation used while parsing C and C++ looks very little like
GENERIC, but the C and C++ gimplifier hooks are perfectly happy to take
it as input and spit out GIMPLE.

10.10 C and C++ Trees
=====================

This section documents the internal representation used by GCC to
represent C and C++ source programs.  When presented with a C or C++
source program, GCC parses the program, performs semantic analysis
(including the generation of error messages), and then produces the
internal representation described here.  This representation contains a
complete representation for the entire translation unit provided as
input to the front end.  This representation is then typically processed
by a code-generator in order to produce machine code, but could also be
used in the creation of source browsers, intelligent editors, automatic
documentation generators, interpreters, and any other programs needing
the ability to process C or C++ code.

 This section explains the internal representation.  In particular, it
documents the internal representation for C and C++ source constructs,
and the macros, functions, and variables that can be used to access
these constructs.  The C++ representation is largely a superset of the
representation used in the C front end.  There is only one construct
used in C that does not appear in the C++ front end and that is the GNU
"nested function" extension.  Many of the macros documented here do not
apply in C because the corresponding language constructs do not appear
in C.

 The C and C++ front ends generate a mix of GENERIC trees and ones
specific to C and C++.  These language-specific trees are higher-level
constructs than the ones in GENERIC to make the parser's job easier.
This section describes those trees that aren't part of GENERIC as well
as aspects of GENERIC trees that are treated in a language-specific
manner.

 If you are developing a "back end", be it is a code-generator or some
other tool, that uses this representation, you may occasionally find
that you need to ask questions not easily answered by the functions and
macros available here.  If that situation occurs, it is quite likely
that GCC already supports the functionality you desire, but that the
interface is simply not documented here.  In that case, you should ask
the GCC maintainers (via mail to <gcc@gcc.gnu.org>) about documenting
the functionality you require.  Similarly, if you find yourself writing
functions that do not deal directly with your back end, but instead
might be useful to other people using the GCC front end, you should
submit your patches for inclusion in GCC.

10.10.1 Types for C++
---------------------

In C++, an array type is not qualified; rather the type of the array
elements is qualified.  This situation is reflected in the intermediate
representation.  The macros described here will always examine the
qualification of the underlying element type when applied to an array
type.  (If the element type is itself an array, then the recursion
continues until a non-array type is found, and the qualification of this
type is examined.)  So, for example, 'CP_TYPE_CONST_P' will hold of the
type 'const int ()[7]', denoting an array of seven 'int's.

 The following functions and macros deal with cv-qualification of types:
'cp_type_quals'
     This function returns the set of type qualifiers applied to this
     type.  This value is 'TYPE_UNQUALIFIED' if no qualifiers have been
     applied.  The 'TYPE_QUAL_CONST' bit is set if the type is
     'const'-qualified.  The 'TYPE_QUAL_VOLATILE' bit is set if the type
     is 'volatile'-qualified.  The 'TYPE_QUAL_RESTRICT' bit is set if
     the type is 'restrict'-qualified.

'CP_TYPE_CONST_P'
     This macro holds if the type is 'const'-qualified.

'CP_TYPE_VOLATILE_P'
     This macro holds if the type is 'volatile'-qualified.

'CP_TYPE_RESTRICT_P'
     This macro holds if the type is 'restrict'-qualified.

'CP_TYPE_CONST_NON_VOLATILE_P'
     This predicate holds for a type that is 'const'-qualified, but
     _not_ 'volatile'-qualified; other cv-qualifiers are ignored as
     well: only the 'const'-ness is tested.

 A few other macros and functions are usable with all types:
'TYPE_SIZE'
     The number of bits required to represent the type, represented as
     an 'INTEGER_CST'.  For an incomplete type, 'TYPE_SIZE' will be
     'NULL_TREE'.

'TYPE_ALIGN'
     The alignment of the type, in bits, represented as an 'int'.

'TYPE_NAME'
     This macro returns a declaration (in the form of a 'TYPE_DECL') for
     the type.  (Note this macro does _not_ return an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE',
     as you might expect, given its name!)  You can look at the
     'DECL_NAME' of the 'TYPE_DECL' to obtain the actual name of the
     type.  The 'TYPE_NAME' will be 'NULL_TREE' for a type that is not a
     built-in type, the result of a typedef, or a named class type.

'CP_INTEGRAL_TYPE'
     This predicate holds if the type is an integral type.  Notice that
     in C++, enumerations are _not_ integral types.

'ARITHMETIC_TYPE_P'
     This predicate holds if the type is an integral type (in the C++
     sense) or a floating point type.

'CLASS_TYPE_P'
     This predicate holds for a class-type.

'TYPE_BUILT_IN'
     This predicate holds for a built-in type.

'TYPE_PTRDATAMEM_P'
     This predicate holds if the type is a pointer to data member.

'TYPE_PTR_P'
     This predicate holds if the type is a pointer type, and the pointee
     is not a data member.

'TYPE_PTRFN_P'
     This predicate holds for a pointer to function type.

'TYPE_PTROB_P'
     This predicate holds for a pointer to object type.  Note however
     that it does not hold for the generic pointer to object type 'void
     *'.  You may use 'TYPE_PTROBV_P' to test for a pointer to object
     type as well as 'void *'.

 The table below describes types specific to C and C++ as well as
language-dependent info about GENERIC types.

'POINTER_TYPE'
     Used to represent pointer types, and pointer to data member types.
     If 'TREE_TYPE' is a pointer to data member type, then
     'TYPE_PTRDATAMEM_P' will hold.  For a pointer to data member type
     of the form 'T X::*', 'TYPE_PTRMEM_CLASS_TYPE' will be the type
     'X', while 'TYPE_PTRMEM_POINTED_TO_TYPE' will be the type 'T'.

'RECORD_TYPE'
     Used to represent 'struct' and 'class' types in C and C++.  If
     'TYPE_PTRMEMFUNC_P' holds, then this type is a pointer-to-member
     type.  In that case, the 'TYPE_PTRMEMFUNC_FN_TYPE' is a
     'POINTER_TYPE' pointing to a 'METHOD_TYPE'.  The 'METHOD_TYPE' is
     the type of a function pointed to by the pointer-to-member
     function.  If 'TYPE_PTRMEMFUNC_P' does not hold, this type is a
     class type.  For more information, *note Classes::.

'UNKNOWN_TYPE'
     This node is used to represent a type the knowledge of which is
     insufficient for a sound processing.

'TYPENAME_TYPE'
     Used to represent a construct of the form 'typename T::A'.  The
     'TYPE_CONTEXT' is 'T'; the 'TYPE_NAME' is an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' for
     'A'.  If the type is specified via a template-id, then
     'TYPENAME_TYPE_FULLNAME' yields a 'TEMPLATE_ID_EXPR'.  The
     'TREE_TYPE' is non-'NULL' if the node is implicitly generated in
     support for the implicit typename extension; in which case the
     'TREE_TYPE' is a type node for the base-class.

'TYPEOF_TYPE'
     Used to represent the '__typeof__' extension.  The 'TYPE_FIELDS' is
     the expression the type of which is being represented.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Namespaces,  Next: Classes,  Prev: Types for C++,  Up: C and C++ Trees

10.10.2 Namespaces
------------------

The root of the entire intermediate representation is the variable
'global_namespace'.  This is the namespace specified with '::' in C++
source code.  All other namespaces, types, variables, functions, and so
forth can be found starting with this namespace.

 However, except for the fact that it is distinguished as the root of
the representation, the global namespace is no different from any other
namespace.  Thus, in what follows, we describe namespaces generally,
rather than the global namespace in particular.

 A namespace is represented by a 'NAMESPACE_DECL' node.

 The following macros and functions can be used on a 'NAMESPACE_DECL':

'DECL_NAME'
     This macro is used to obtain the 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' corresponding to
     the unqualified name of the name of the namespace (*note
     Identifiers::).  The name of the global namespace is '::', even
     though in C++ the global namespace is unnamed.  However, you should
     use comparison with 'global_namespace', rather than 'DECL_NAME' to
     determine whether or not a namespace is the global one.  An unnamed
     namespace will have a 'DECL_NAME' equal to
     'anonymous_namespace_name'.  Within a single translation unit, all
     unnamed namespaces will have the same name.

'DECL_CONTEXT'
     This macro returns the enclosing namespace.  The 'DECL_CONTEXT' for
     the 'global_namespace' is 'NULL_TREE'.

'DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS'
     If this declaration is for a namespace alias, then
     'DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS' is the namespace for which this one is an
     alias.

     Do not attempt to use 'cp_namespace_decls' for a namespace which is
     an alias.  Instead, follow 'DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS' links until you
     reach an ordinary, non-alias, namespace, and call
     'cp_namespace_decls' there.

'DECL_NAMESPACE_STD_P'
     This predicate holds if the namespace is the special '::std'
     namespace.

'cp_namespace_decls'
     This function will return the declarations contained in the
     namespace, including types, overloaded functions, other namespaces,
     and so forth.  If there are no declarations, this function will
     return 'NULL_TREE'.  The declarations are connected through their
     'TREE_CHAIN' fields.

     Although most entries on this list will be declarations,
     'TREE_LIST' nodes may also appear.  In this case, the 'TREE_VALUE'
     will be an 'OVERLOAD'.  The value of the 'TREE_PURPOSE' is
     unspecified; back ends should ignore this value.  As with the other
     kinds of declarations returned by 'cp_namespace_decls', the
     'TREE_CHAIN' will point to the next declaration in this list.

     For more information on the kinds of declarations that can occur on
     this list, *Note Declarations::.  Some declarations will not appear
     on this list.  In particular, no 'FIELD_DECL', 'LABEL_DECL', or
     'PARM_DECL' nodes will appear here.

     This function cannot be used with namespaces that have
     'DECL_NAMESPACE_ALIAS' set.

10.10.3 Classes
---------------

Besides namespaces, the other high-level scoping construct in C++ is the
class.  (Throughout this manual the term "class" is used to mean the
types referred to in the ANSI/ISO C++ Standard as classes; these include
types defined with the 'class', 'struct', and 'union' keywords.)

 A class type is represented by either a 'RECORD_TYPE' or a
'UNION_TYPE'.  A class declared with the 'union' tag is represented by a
'UNION_TYPE', while classes declared with either the 'struct' or the
'class' tag are represented by 'RECORD_TYPE's.  You can use the
'CLASSTYPE_DECLARED_CLASS' macro to discern whether or not a particular
type is a 'class' as opposed to a 'struct'.  This macro will be true
only for classes declared with the 'class' tag.

 Almost all non-function members are available on the 'TYPE_FIELDS'
list.  Given one member, the next can be found by following the
'TREE_CHAIN'.  You should not depend in any way on the order in which
fields appear on this list.  All nodes on this list will be 'DECL'
nodes.  A 'FIELD_DECL' is used to represent a non-static data member, a
'VAR_DECL' is used to represent a static data member, and a 'TYPE_DECL'
is used to represent a type.  Note that the 'CONST_DECL' for an
enumeration constant will appear on this list, if the enumeration type
was declared in the class.  (Of course, the 'TYPE_DECL' for the
enumeration type will appear here as well.)  There are no entries for
base classes on this list.  In particular, there is no 'FIELD_DECL' for
the "base-class portion" of an object.

 The 'TYPE_VFIELD' is a compiler-generated field used to point to
virtual function tables.  It may or may not appear on the 'TYPE_FIELDS'
list.  However, back ends should handle the 'TYPE_VFIELD' just like all
the entries on the 'TYPE_FIELDS' list.

 The function members are available on the 'TYPE_METHODS' list.  Again,
subsequent members are found by following the 'TREE_CHAIN' field.  If a
function is overloaded, each of the overloaded functions appears; no
'OVERLOAD' nodes appear on the 'TYPE_METHODS' list.  Implicitly declared
functions (including default constructors, copy constructors, assignment
operators, and destructors) will appear on this list as well.

 Every class has an associated "binfo", which can be obtained with
'TYPE_BINFO'.  Binfos are used to represent base-classes.  The binfo
given by 'TYPE_BINFO' is the degenerate case, whereby every class is
considered to be its own base-class.  The base binfos for a particular
binfo are held in a vector, whose length is obtained with
'BINFO_N_BASE_BINFOS'.  The base binfos themselves are obtained with
'BINFO_BASE_BINFO' and 'BINFO_BASE_ITERATE'.  To add a new binfo, use
'BINFO_BASE_APPEND'.  The vector of base binfos can be obtained with
'BINFO_BASE_BINFOS', but normally you do not need to use that.  The
class type associated with a binfo is given by 'BINFO_TYPE'.  It is not
always the case that 'BINFO_TYPE (TYPE_BINFO (x))', because of typedefs
and qualified types.  Neither is it the case that 'TYPE_BINFO
(BINFO_TYPE (y))' is the same binfo as 'y'.  The reason is that if 'y'
is a binfo representing a base-class 'B' of a derived class 'D', then
'BINFO_TYPE (y)' will be 'B', and 'TYPE_BINFO (BINFO_TYPE (y))' will be
'B' as its own base-class, rather than as a base-class of 'D'.

 The access to a base type can be found with 'BINFO_BASE_ACCESS'.  This
will produce 'access_public_node', 'access_private_node' or
'access_protected_node'.  If bases are always public,
'BINFO_BASE_ACCESSES' may be 'NULL'.

 'BINFO_VIRTUAL_P' is used to specify whether the binfo is inherited
virtually or not.  The other flags, 'BINFO_MARKED_P' and 'BINFO_FLAG_1'
to 'BINFO_FLAG_6' can be used for language specific use.

 The following macros can be used on a tree node representing a
class-type.

'LOCAL_CLASS_P'
     This predicate holds if the class is local class _i.e._ declared
     inside a function body.

'TYPE_POLYMORPHIC_P'
     This predicate holds if the class has at least one virtual function
     (declared or inherited).

'TYPE_HAS_DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTOR'
     This predicate holds whenever its argument represents a class-type
     with default constructor.

'CLASSTYPE_HAS_MUTABLE'
'TYPE_HAS_MUTABLE_P'
     These predicates hold for a class-type having a mutable data
     member.

'CLASSTYPE_NON_POD_P'
     This predicate holds only for class-types that are not PODs.

'TYPE_HAS_NEW_OPERATOR'
     This predicate holds for a class-type that defines 'operator new'.

'TYPE_HAS_ARRAY_NEW_OPERATOR'
     This predicate holds for a class-type for which 'operator new[]' is
     defined.

'TYPE_OVERLOADS_CALL_EXPR'
     This predicate holds for class-type for which the function call
     'operator()' is overloaded.

'TYPE_OVERLOADS_ARRAY_REF'
     This predicate holds for a class-type that overloads 'operator[]'

'TYPE_OVERLOADS_ARROW'
     This predicate holds for a class-type for which 'operator->' is
     overloaded.

10.10.4 Functions for C++
-------------------------

A function is represented by a 'FUNCTION_DECL' node.  A set of
overloaded functions is sometimes represented by an 'OVERLOAD' node.

 An 'OVERLOAD' node is not a declaration, so none of the 'DECL_' macros
should be used on an 'OVERLOAD'.  An 'OVERLOAD' node is similar to a
'TREE_LIST'.  Use 'OVL_CURRENT' to get the function associated with an
'OVERLOAD' node; use 'OVL_NEXT' to get the next 'OVERLOAD' node in the
list of overloaded functions.  The macros 'OVL_CURRENT' and 'OVL_NEXT'
are actually polymorphic; you can use them to work with 'FUNCTION_DECL'
nodes as well as with overloads.  In the case of a 'FUNCTION_DECL',
'OVL_CURRENT' will always return the function itself, and 'OVL_NEXT'
will always be 'NULL_TREE'.

 To determine the scope of a function, you can use the 'DECL_CONTEXT'
macro.  This macro will return the class (either a 'RECORD_TYPE' or a
'UNION_TYPE') or namespace (a 'NAMESPACE_DECL') of which the function is
a member.  For a virtual function, this macro returns the class in which
the function was actually defined, not the base class in which the
virtual declaration occurred.

 If a friend function is defined in a class scope, the
'DECL_FRIEND_CONTEXT' macro can be used to determine the class in which
it was defined.  For example, in
     class C { friend void f() {} };
the 'DECL_CONTEXT' for 'f' will be the 'global_namespace', but the
'DECL_FRIEND_CONTEXT' will be the 'RECORD_TYPE' for 'C'.

 The following macros and functions can be used on a 'FUNCTION_DECL':
'DECL_MAIN_P'
     This predicate holds for a function that is the program entry point
     '::code'.

'DECL_LOCAL_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function was declared at block scope,
     even though it has a global scope.

'DECL_ANTICIPATED'
     This predicate holds if the function is a built-in function but its
     prototype is not yet explicitly declared.

'DECL_EXTERN_C_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is declared as an ''extern
     "C"'' function.

'DECL_LINKONCE_P'
     This macro holds if multiple copies of this function may be emitted
     in various translation units.  It is the responsibility of the
     linker to merge the various copies.  Template instantiations are
     the most common example of functions for which 'DECL_LINKONCE_P'
     holds; G++ instantiates needed templates in all translation units
     which require them, and then relies on the linker to remove
     duplicate instantiations.

     FIXME: This macro is not yet implemented.

'DECL_FUNCTION_MEMBER_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a member of a class, rather
     than a member of a namespace.

'DECL_STATIC_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function a static member function.

'DECL_NONSTATIC_MEMBER_FUNCTION_P'
     This macro holds for a non-static member function.

'DECL_CONST_MEMFUNC_P'
     This predicate holds for a 'const'-member function.

'DECL_VOLATILE_MEMFUNC_P'
     This predicate holds for a 'volatile'-member function.

'DECL_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a constructor.

'DECL_NONCONVERTING_P'
     This predicate holds if the constructor is a non-converting
     constructor.

'DECL_COMPLETE_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds for a function which is a constructor for an
     object of a complete type.

'DECL_BASE_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds for a function which is a constructor for a
     base class sub-object.

'DECL_COPY_CONSTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds for a function which is a copy-constructor.

'DECL_DESTRUCTOR_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a destructor.

'DECL_COMPLETE_DESTRUCTOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is the destructor for an
     object a complete type.

'DECL_OVERLOADED_OPERATOR_P'
     This macro holds if the function is an overloaded operator.

'DECL_CONV_FN_P'
     This macro holds if the function is a type-conversion operator.

'DECL_GLOBAL_CTOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is a file-scope initialization
     function.

'DECL_GLOBAL_DTOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is a file-scope finalization
     function.

'DECL_THUNK_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is a thunk.

     These functions represent stub code that adjusts the 'this' pointer
     and then jumps to another function.  When the jumped-to function
     returns, control is transferred directly to the caller, without
     returning to the thunk.  The first parameter to the thunk is always
     the 'this' pointer; the thunk should add 'THUNK_DELTA' to this
     value.  (The 'THUNK_DELTA' is an 'int', not an 'INTEGER_CST'.)

     Then, if 'THUNK_VCALL_OFFSET' (an 'INTEGER_CST') is nonzero the
     adjusted 'this' pointer must be adjusted again.  The complete
     calculation is given by the following pseudo-code:

          this += THUNK_DELTA
          if (THUNK_VCALL_OFFSET)
            this += (*((ptrdiff_t **) this))[THUNK_VCALL_OFFSET]

     Finally, the thunk should jump to the location given by
     'DECL_INITIAL'; this will always be an expression for the address
     of a function.

'DECL_NON_THUNK_FUNCTION_P'
     This predicate holds if the function is _not_ a thunk function.

'GLOBAL_INIT_PRIORITY'
     If either 'DECL_GLOBAL_CTOR_P' or 'DECL_GLOBAL_DTOR_P' holds, then
     this gives the initialization priority for the function.  The
     linker will arrange that all functions for which
     'DECL_GLOBAL_CTOR_P' holds are run in increasing order of priority
     before 'main' is called.  When the program exits, all functions for
     which 'DECL_GLOBAL_DTOR_P' holds are run in the reverse order.

'TYPE_RAISES_EXCEPTIONS'
     This macro returns the list of exceptions that a (member-)function
     can raise.  The returned list, if non 'NULL', is comprised of nodes
     whose 'TREE_VALUE' represents a type.

'TYPE_NOTHROW_P'
     This predicate holds when the exception-specification of its
     arguments is of the form ''()''.

'DECL_ARRAY_DELETE_OPERATOR_P'
     This predicate holds if the function an overloaded 'operator
     delete[]'.

10.10.5 Statements for C++
--------------------------

A function that has a definition in the current translation unit will
have a non-'NULL' 'DECL_INITIAL'.  However, back ends should not make
use of the particular value given by 'DECL_INITIAL'.

 The 'DECL_SAVED_TREE' macro will give the complete body of the
function.

10.10.5.1 Statements
....................

There are tree nodes corresponding to all of the source-level statement
constructs, used within the C and C++ frontends.  These are enumerated
here, together with a list of the various macros that can be used to
obtain information about them.  There are a few macros that can be used
with all statements:

'STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P'
     In C++, statements normally constitute "full expressions";
     temporaries created during a statement are destroyed when the
     statement is complete.  However, G++ sometimes represents
     expressions by statements; these statements will not have
     'STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P' set.  Temporaries created during such
     statements should be destroyed when the innermost enclosing
     statement with 'STMT_IS_FULL_EXPR_P' set is exited.

 Here is the list of the various statement nodes, and the macros used to
access them.  This documentation describes the use of these nodes in
non-template functions (including instantiations of template functions).
In template functions, the same nodes are used, but sometimes in
slightly different ways.

 Many of the statements have substatements.  For example, a 'while' loop
will have a body, which is itself a statement.  If the substatement is
'NULL_TREE', it is considered equivalent to a statement consisting of a
single ';', i.e., an expression statement in which the expression has
been omitted.  A substatement may in fact be a list of statements,
connected via their 'TREE_CHAIN's.  So, you should always process the
statement tree by looping over substatements, like this:
     void process_stmt (stmt)
          tree stmt;
     {
       while (stmt)
         {
           switch (TREE_CODE (stmt))
             {
             case IF_STMT:
               process_stmt (THEN_CLAUSE (stmt));
               /* More processing here.  */
               break;

             ...
             }

           stmt = TREE_CHAIN (stmt);
         }
     }
 In other words, while the 'then' clause of an 'if' statement in C++ can
be only one statement (although that one statement may be a compound
statement), the intermediate representation will sometimes use several
statements chained together.

'BREAK_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'break' statement.  There are no additional
     fields.

'CILK_SPAWN_STMT'

     Used to represent a spawning function in the Cilk Plus language
     extension.  This tree has one field that holds the name of the
     spawning function.  '_Cilk_spawn' can be written in C in the
     following way:

          _Cilk_spawn <function_name> (<parameters>);

     Detailed description for usage and functionality of '_Cilk_spawn'
     can be found at http://www.cilkplus.org

'CILK_SYNC_STMT'

     This statement is part of the Cilk Plus language extension.  It
     indicates that the current function cannot continue in parallel
     with its spawned children.  There are no additional fields.
     '_Cilk_sync' can be written in C in the following way:

          _Cilk_sync;

'CLEANUP_STMT'

     Used to represent an action that should take place upon exit from
     the enclosing scope.  Typically, these actions are calls to
     destructors for local objects, but back ends cannot rely on this
     fact.  If these nodes are in fact representing such destructors,
     'CLEANUP_DECL' will be the 'VAR_DECL' destroyed.  Otherwise,
     'CLEANUP_DECL' will be 'NULL_TREE'.  In any case, the
     'CLEANUP_EXPR' is the expression to execute.  The cleanups executed
     on exit from a scope should be run in the reverse order of the
     order in which the associated 'CLEANUP_STMT's were encountered.

'CONTINUE_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'continue' statement.  There are no additional
     fields.

'CTOR_STMT'

     Used to mark the beginning (if 'CTOR_BEGIN_P' holds) or end (if
     'CTOR_END_P' holds of the main body of a constructor.  See also
     'SUBOBJECT' for more information on how to use these nodes.

'DO_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'do' loop.  The body of the loop is given by
     'DO_BODY' while the termination condition for the loop is given by
     'DO_COND'.  The condition for a 'do'-statement is always an
     expression.

'EMPTY_CLASS_EXPR'

     Used to represent a temporary object of a class with no data whose
     address is never taken.  (All such objects are interchangeable.)
     The 'TREE_TYPE' represents the type of the object.

'EXPR_STMT'

     Used to represent an expression statement.  Use 'EXPR_STMT_EXPR' to
     obtain the expression.

'FOR_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'for' statement.  The 'FOR_INIT_STMT' is the
     initialization statement for the loop.  The 'FOR_COND' is the
     termination condition.  The 'FOR_EXPR' is the expression executed
     right before the 'FOR_COND' on each loop iteration; often, this
     expression increments a counter.  The body of the loop is given by
     'FOR_BODY'.  Note that 'FOR_INIT_STMT' and 'FOR_BODY' return
     statements, while 'FOR_COND' and 'FOR_EXPR' return expressions.

'HANDLER'

     Used to represent a C++ 'catch' block.  The 'HANDLER_TYPE' is the
     type of exception that will be caught by this handler; it is equal
     (by pointer equality) to 'NULL' if this handler is for all types.
     'HANDLER_PARMS' is the 'DECL_STMT' for the catch parameter, and
     'HANDLER_BODY' is the code for the block itself.

'IF_STMT'

     Used to represent an 'if' statement.  The 'IF_COND' is the
     expression.

     If the condition is a 'TREE_LIST', then the 'TREE_PURPOSE' is a
     statement (usually a 'DECL_STMT').  Each time the condition is
     evaluated, the statement should be executed.  Then, the
     'TREE_VALUE' should be used as the conditional expression itself.
     This representation is used to handle C++ code like this:

     C++ distinguishes between this and 'COND_EXPR' for handling
     templates.

          if (int i = 7) ...

     where there is a new local variable (or variables) declared within
     the condition.

     The 'THEN_CLAUSE' represents the statement given by the 'then'
     condition, while the 'ELSE_CLAUSE' represents the statement given
     by the 'else' condition.

'SUBOBJECT'

     In a constructor, these nodes are used to mark the point at which a
     subobject of 'this' is fully constructed.  If, after this point, an
     exception is thrown before a 'CTOR_STMT' with 'CTOR_END_P' set is
     encountered, the 'SUBOBJECT_CLEANUP' must be executed.  The
     cleanups must be executed in the reverse order in which they
     appear.

'SWITCH_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'switch' statement.  The 'SWITCH_STMT_COND' is
     the expression on which the switch is occurring.  See the
     documentation for an 'IF_STMT' for more information on the
     representation used for the condition.  The 'SWITCH_STMT_BODY' is
     the body of the switch statement.  The 'SWITCH_STMT_TYPE' is the
     original type of switch expression as given in the source, before
     any compiler conversions.

'TRY_BLOCK'
     Used to represent a 'try' block.  The body of the try block is
     given by 'TRY_STMTS'.  Each of the catch blocks is a 'HANDLER'
     node.  The first handler is given by 'TRY_HANDLERS'.  Subsequent
     handlers are obtained by following the 'TREE_CHAIN' link from one
     handler to the next.  The body of the handler is given by
     'HANDLER_BODY'.

     If 'CLEANUP_P' holds of the 'TRY_BLOCK', then the 'TRY_HANDLERS'
     will not be a 'HANDLER' node.  Instead, it will be an expression
     that should be executed if an exception is thrown in the try block.
     It must rethrow the exception after executing that code.  And, if
     an exception is thrown while the expression is executing,
     'terminate' must be called.

'USING_STMT'
     Used to represent a 'using' directive.  The namespace is given by
     'USING_STMT_NAMESPACE', which will be a NAMESPACE_DECL.  This node
     is needed inside template functions, to implement using directives
     during instantiation.

'WHILE_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'while' loop.  The 'WHILE_COND' is the
     termination condition for the loop.  See the documentation for an
     'IF_STMT' for more information on the representation used for the
     condition.

     The 'WHILE_BODY' is the body of the loop.

10.10.6 C++ Expressions
-----------------------

This section describes expressions specific to the C and C++ front ends.

'TYPEID_EXPR'

     Used to represent a 'typeid' expression.

'NEW_EXPR'
'VEC_NEW_EXPR'

     Used to represent a call to 'new' and 'new[]' respectively.

'DELETE_EXPR'
'VEC_DELETE_EXPR'

     Used to represent a call to 'delete' and 'delete[]' respectively.

'MEMBER_REF'

     Represents a reference to a member of a class.

'THROW_EXPR'

     Represents an instance of 'throw' in the program.  Operand 0, which
     is the expression to throw, may be 'NULL_TREE'.

'AGGR_INIT_EXPR'
     An 'AGGR_INIT_EXPR' represents the initialization as the return
     value of a function call, or as the result of a constructor.  An
     'AGGR_INIT_EXPR' will only appear as a full-expression, or as the
     second operand of a 'TARGET_EXPR'.  'AGGR_INIT_EXPR's have a
     representation similar to that of 'CALL_EXPR's.  You can use the
     'AGGR_INIT_EXPR_FN' and 'AGGR_INIT_EXPR_ARG' macros to access the
     function to call and the arguments to pass.

     If 'AGGR_INIT_VIA_CTOR_P' holds of the 'AGGR_INIT_EXPR', then the
     initialization is via a constructor call.  The address of the
     'AGGR_INIT_EXPR_SLOT' operand, which is always a 'VAR_DECL', is
     taken, and this value replaces the first argument in the argument
     list.

     In either case, the expression is void.

File: gccint.info,  Node: GIMPLE,  Next: Tree SSA,  Prev: GENERIC,  Up: Top

11 GIMPLE
*********

GIMPLE is a three-address representation derived from GENERIC by
breaking down GENERIC expressions into tuples of no more than 3 operands
(with some exceptions like function calls).  GIMPLE was heavily
influenced by the SIMPLE IL used by the McCAT compiler project at McGill
University, though we have made some different choices.  For one thing,
SIMPLE doesn't support 'goto'.

 Temporaries are introduced to hold intermediate values needed to
compute complex expressions.  Additionally, all the control structures
used in GENERIC are lowered into conditional jumps, lexical scopes are
removed and exception regions are converted into an on the side
exception region tree.

 The compiler pass which converts GENERIC into GIMPLE is referred to as
the 'gimplifier'.  The gimplifier works recursively, generating GIMPLE
tuples out of the original GENERIC expressions.

 One of the early implementation strategies used for the GIMPLE
representation was to use the same internal data structures used by
front ends to represent parse trees.  This simplified implementation
because we could leverage existing functionality and interfaces.
However, GIMPLE is a much more restrictive representation than abstract
syntax trees (AST), therefore it does not require the full structural
complexity provided by the main tree data structure.

 The GENERIC representation of a function is stored in the
'DECL_SAVED_TREE' field of the associated 'FUNCTION_DECL' tree node.  It
is converted to GIMPLE by a call to 'gimplify_function_tree'.

 If a front end wants to include language-specific tree codes in the
tree representation which it provides to the back end, it must provide a
definition of 'LANG_HOOKS_GIMPLIFY_EXPR' which knows how to convert the
front end trees to GIMPLE.  Usually such a hook will involve much of the
same code for expanding front end trees to RTL.  This function can
return fully lowered GIMPLE, or it can return GENERIC trees and let the
main gimplifier lower them the rest of the way; this is often simpler.
GIMPLE that is not fully lowered is known as "High GIMPLE" and consists
of the IL before the pass 'pass_lower_cf'.  High GIMPLE contains some
container statements like lexical scopes (represented by 'GIMPLE_BIND')
and nested expressions (e.g., 'GIMPLE_TRY'), while "Low GIMPLE" exposes
all of the implicit jumps for control and exception expressions directly
in the IL and EH region trees.

 The C and C++ front ends currently convert directly from front end
trees to GIMPLE, and hand that off to the back end rather than first
converting to GENERIC.  Their gimplifier hooks know about all the
'_STMT' nodes and how to convert them to GENERIC forms.  There was some
work done on a genericization pass which would run first, but the
existence of 'STMT_EXPR' meant that in order to convert all of the C
statements into GENERIC equivalents would involve walking the entire
tree anyway, so it was simpler to lower all the way.  This might change
in the future if someone writes an optimization pass which would work
better with higher-level trees, but currently the optimizers all expect

11.1 Tuple representation
=========================

GIMPLE instructions are tuples of variable size divided in two groups: a
header describing the instruction and its locations, and a variable
length body with all the operands.  Tuples are organized into a
hierarchy with 3 main classes of tuples.

11.1.1 'gimple_statement_base' (gsbase)
---------------------------------------

This is the root of the hierarchy, it holds basic information needed by
most GIMPLE statements.  There are some fields that may not be relevant
to every GIMPLE statement, but those were moved into the base structure
to take advantage of holes left by other fields (thus making the
structure more compact).  The structure takes 4 words (32 bytes) on 64
bit hosts:

Field                   Size (bits)
'code'                  8
'subcode'               16
'no_warning'            1
'visited'               1
'nontemporal_move'      1
'plf'                   2
'modified'              1
'has_volatile_ops'      1
'references_memory_p'   1
'uid'                   32
'location'              32
'num_ops'               32
'bb'                    64
'block'                 63
Total size              32 bytes

   * 'code' Main identifier for a GIMPLE instruction.

   * 'subcode' Used to distinguish different variants of the same basic
     instruction or provide flags applicable to a given code.  The
     'subcode' flags field has different uses depending on the code of
     the instruction, but mostly it distinguishes instructions of the
     same family.  The most prominent use of this field is in
     assignments, where subcode indicates the operation done on the RHS
     of the assignment.  For example, a = b + c is encoded as
     'GIMPLE_ASSIGN <PLUS_EXPR, a, b, c>'.

   * 'no_warning' Bitflag to indicate whether a warning has already been
     issued on this statement.

   * 'visited' General purpose "visited" marker.  Set and cleared by
     each pass when needed.

   * 'nontemporal_move' Bitflag used in assignments that represent
     non-temporal moves.  Although this bitflag is only used in
     assignments, it was moved into the base to take advantage of the
     bit holes left by the previous fields.

   * 'plf' Pass Local Flags.  This 2-bit mask can be used as general
     purpose markers by any pass.  Passes are responsible for clearing
     and setting these two flags accordingly.

   * 'modified' Bitflag to indicate whether the statement has been
     modified.  Used mainly by the operand scanner to determine when to
     re-scan a statement for operands.

   * 'has_volatile_ops' Bitflag to indicate whether this statement
     contains operands that have been marked volatile.

   * 'references_memory_p' Bitflag to indicate whether this statement
     contains memory references (i.e., its operands are either global
     variables, or pointer dereferences or anything that must reside in
     memory).

   * 'uid' This is an unsigned integer used by passes that want to
     assign IDs to every statement.  These IDs must be assigned and used
     by each pass.

   * 'location' This is a 'location_t' identifier to specify source code
     location for this statement.  It is inherited from the front end.

   * 'num_ops' Number of operands that this statement has.  This
     specifies the size of the operand vector embedded in the tuple.
     Only used in some tuples, but it is declared in the base tuple to
     take advantage of the 32-bit hole left by the previous fields.

   * 'bb' Basic block holding the instruction.

   * 'block' Lexical block holding this statement.  Also used for debug
     information generation.

11.1.2 'gimple_statement_with_ops'
----------------------------------

This tuple is actually split in two: 'gimple_statement_with_ops_base'
and 'gimple_statement_with_ops'.  This is needed to accommodate the way
the operand vector is allocated.  The operand vector is defined to be an
array of 1 element.  So, to allocate a dynamic number of operands, the
memory allocator ('gimple_alloc') simply allocates enough memory to hold
the structure itself plus 'N - 1' operands which run "off the end" of
the structure.  For example, to allocate space for a tuple with 3
operands, 'gimple_alloc' reserves 'sizeof (struct
gimple_statement_with_ops) + 2 * sizeof (tree)' bytes.

 On the other hand, several fields in this tuple need to be shared with
the 'gimple_statement_with_memory_ops' tuple.  So, these common fields
are placed in 'gimple_statement_with_ops_base' which is then inherited
from the other two tuples.

'gsbase'    256
'def_ops'   64
'use_ops'   64
'op'        'num_ops' * 64
Total       48 + 8 * 'num_ops' bytes
size

   * 'gsbase' Inherited from 'struct gimple_statement_base'.

   * 'def_ops' Array of pointers into the operand array indicating all
     the slots that contain a variable written-to by the statement.
     This array is also used for immediate use chaining.  Note that it
     would be possible to not rely on this array, but the changes
     required to implement this are pretty invasive.

   * 'use_ops' Similar to 'def_ops' but for variables read by the
     statement.

   * 'op' Array of trees with 'num_ops' slots.

11.1.3 'gimple_statement_with_memory_ops'
-----------------------------------------

This tuple is essentially identical to 'gimple_statement_with_ops',
except that it contains 4 additional fields to hold vectors related
memory stores and loads.  Similar to the previous case, the structure is
split in two to accommodate for the operand vector
('gimple_statement_with_memory_ops_base' and
'gimple_statement_with_memory_ops').

Field        Size (bits)
'gsbase'     256
'def_ops'    64
'use_ops'    64
'vdef_ops'   64
'vuse_ops'   64
'stores'     64
'loads'      64
'op'         'num_ops' * 64
Total size   80 + 8 * 'num_ops' bytes

   * 'vdef_ops' Similar to 'def_ops' but for 'VDEF' operators.  There is
     one entry per memory symbol written by this statement.  This is
     used to maintain the memory SSA use-def and def-def chains.

   * 'vuse_ops' Similar to 'use_ops' but for 'VUSE' operators.  There is
     one entry per memory symbol loaded by this statement.  This is used
     to maintain the memory SSA use-def chains.

   * 'stores' Bitset with all the UIDs for the symbols written-to by the
     statement.  This is different than 'vdef_ops' in that all the
     affected symbols are mentioned in this set.  If memory partitioning
     is enabled, the 'vdef_ops' vector will refer to memory partitions.
     Furthermore, no SSA information is stored in this set.

   * 'loads' Similar to 'stores', but for memory loads.  (Note that
     there is some amount of redundancy here, it should be possible to
     reduce memory utilization further by removing these sets).

 All the other tuples are defined in terms of these three basic ones.
Each tuple will add some fields.  The main gimple type is defined to be
the union of all these structures ('GTY' markers elided for clarity):

     union gimple_statement_d
     {
       struct gimple_statement_base gsbase;
       struct gimple_statement_with_ops gsops;
       struct gimple_statement_with_memory_ops gsmem;
       struct gimple_statement_omp omp;
       struct gimple_statement_bind gimple_bind;
       struct gimple_statement_catch gimple_catch;
       struct gimple_statement_eh_filter gimple_eh_filter;
       struct gimple_statement_phi gimple_phi;
       struct gimple_statement_resx gimple_resx;
       struct gimple_statement_try gimple_try;
       struct gimple_statement_wce gimple_wce;
       struct gimple_statement_asm gimple_asm;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_critical gimple_omp_critical;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_for gimple_omp_for;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_parallel gimple_omp_parallel;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_task gimple_omp_task;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_sections gimple_omp_sections;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_single gimple_omp_single;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_continue gimple_omp_continue;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_atomic_load gimple_omp_atomic_load;
       struct gimple_statement_omp_atomic_store gimple_omp_atomic_store;
     };

11.3 Exception Handling
=======================

Other exception handling constructs are represented using
'GIMPLE_TRY_CATCH'.  'GIMPLE_TRY_CATCH' has two operands.  The first
operand is a sequence of statements to execute.  If executing these
statements does not throw an exception, then the second operand is
ignored.  Otherwise, if an exception is thrown, then the second operand
of the 'GIMPLE_TRY_CATCH' is checked.  The second operand may have the
following forms:

  1. A sequence of statements to execute.  When an exception occurs,
     these statements are executed, and then the exception is rethrown.

  2. A sequence of 'GIMPLE_CATCH' statements.  Each 'GIMPLE_CATCH' has a
     list of applicable exception types and handler code.  If the thrown
     exception matches one of the caught types, the associated handler
     code is executed.  If the handler code falls off the bottom,
     execution continues after the original 'GIMPLE_TRY_CATCH'.

  3. A 'GIMPLE_EH_FILTER' statement.  This has a list of permitted
     exception types, and code to handle a match failure.  If the thrown
     exception does not match one of the allowed types, the associated
     match failure code is executed.  If the thrown exception does
     match, it continues unwinding the stack looking for the next
     handler.

 Currently throwing an exception is not directly represented in GIMPLE,
since it is implemented by calling a function.  At some point in the
future we will want to add some way to express that the call will throw
an exception of a known type.

 Just before running the optimizers, the compiler lowers the high-level
EH constructs above into a set of 'goto's, magic labels, and EH regions.
Continuing to unwind at the end of a cleanup is represented with a
'GIMPLE_RESX'.

11.4 Temporaries
================

When gimplification encounters a subexpression that is too complex, it
creates a new temporary variable to hold the value of the subexpression,
and adds a new statement to initialize it before the current statement.
These special temporaries are known as 'expression temporaries', and are
allocated using 'get_formal_tmp_var'.  The compiler tries to always
evaluate identical expressions into the same temporary, to simplify
elimination of redundant calculations.

 We can only use expression temporaries when we know that it will not be
reevaluated before its value is used, and that it will not be otherwise
modified(1).  Other temporaries can be allocated using
'get_initialized_tmp_var' or 'create_tmp_var'.

 Currently, an expression like 'a = b + 5' is not reduced any further.
We tried converting it to something like
     T1 = b + 5;
     a = T1;
 but this bloated the representation for minimal benefit.  However, a
variable which must live in memory cannot appear in an expression; its
value is explicitly loaded into a temporary first.  Similarly, storing
the value of an expression to a memory variable goes through a
temporary.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) These restrictions are derived from those in Morgan 4.8.

11.5 Operands
=============

In general, expressions in GIMPLE consist of an operation and the
appropriate number of simple operands; these operands must either be a
GIMPLE rvalue ('is_gimple_val'), i.e. a constant or a register variable.
More complex operands are factored out into temporaries, so that
     a = b + c + d
 becomes
     T1 = b + c;
     a = T1 + d;

 The same rule holds for arguments to a 'GIMPLE_CALL'.

 The target of an assignment is usually a variable, but can also be a
'MEM_REF' or a compound lvalue as described below.

* Compound Lvalues::
* Conditional Expressions::
* Logical Operators::


File: gccint.info,  Node: Compound Expressions,  Next: Compound Lvalues,  Up: Operands

11.5.1 Compound Expressions
---------------------------

The left-hand side of a C comma expression is simply moved into a
separate statement.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Compound Lvalues,  Next: Conditional Expressions,  Prev: Compound Expressions,  Up: Operands

11.5.2 Compound Lvalues
-----------------------

Currently compound lvalues involving array and structure field
references are not broken down; an expression like 'a.b[2] = 42' is not
reduced any further (though complex array subscripts are).  This
restriction is a workaround for limitations in later optimizers; if we
were to convert this to

     T1 = &a.b;
     T1[2] = 42;

 alias analysis would not remember that the reference to 'T1[2]' came by
way of 'a.b', so it would think that the assignment could alias another
member of 'a'; this broke 'struct-alias-1.c'.  Future optimizer
improvements may make this limitation unnecessary.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Conditional Expressions,  Next: Logical Operators,  Prev: Compound Lvalues,  Up: Operands

11.5.3 Conditional Expressions
------------------------------

A C '?:' expression is converted into an 'if' statement with each branch
assigning to the same temporary.  So,

     a = b ? c : d;
 becomes
     if (b == 1)
       T1 = c;
     else
       T1 = d;
     a = T1;

 The GIMPLE level if-conversion pass re-introduces '?:' expression, if
appropriate.  It is used to vectorize loops with conditions using vector
conditional operations.

 Note that in GIMPLE, 'if' statements are represented using
'GIMPLE_COND', as described below.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Logical Operators,  Prev: Conditional Expressions,  Up: Operands

11.5.4 Logical Operators
------------------------

Except when they appear in the condition operand of a 'GIMPLE_COND',
logical 'and' and 'or' operators are simplified as follows: 'a = b && c'
becomes

     T1 = (bool)b;
     if (T1 == true)
       T1 = (bool)c;
     a = T1;

 Note that 'T1' in this example cannot be an expression temporary,
because it has two different assignments.

11.5.5 Manipulating operands
----------------------------

All gimple operands are of type 'tree'.  But only certain types of trees
are allowed to be used as operand tuples.  Basic validation is
controlled by the function 'get_gimple_rhs_class', which given a tree
code, returns an 'enum' with the following values of type 'enum
gimple_rhs_class'

   * 'GIMPLE_INVALID_RHS' The tree cannot be used as a GIMPLE operand.

   * 'GIMPLE_TERNARY_RHS' The tree is a valid GIMPLE ternary operation.

   * 'GIMPLE_BINARY_RHS' The tree is a valid GIMPLE binary operation.

   * 'GIMPLE_UNARY_RHS' The tree is a valid GIMPLE unary operation.

   * 'GIMPLE_SINGLE_RHS' The tree is a single object, that cannot be
     split into simpler operands (for instance, 'SSA_NAME', 'VAR_DECL',
     'COMPONENT_REF', etc).

     This operand class also acts as an escape hatch for tree nodes that
     may be flattened out into the operand vector, but would need more
     than two slots on the RHS. For instance, a 'COND_EXPR' expression
     of the form '(a op b) ? x : y' could be flattened out on the
     operand vector using 4 slots, but it would also require additional
     processing to distinguish 'c = a op b' from 'c = a op b ? x : y'.
     Something similar occurs with 'ASSERT_EXPR'.  In time, these
     special case tree expressions should be flattened into the operand
     vector.

 For tree nodes in the categories 'GIMPLE_TERNARY_RHS',
'GIMPLE_BINARY_RHS' and 'GIMPLE_UNARY_RHS', they cannot be stored inside
tuples directly.  They first need to be flattened and separated into
individual components.  For instance, given the GENERIC expression

     a = b + c

 its tree representation is:

     MODIFY_EXPR <VAR_DECL  <a>, PLUS_EXPR <VAR_DECL <b>, VAR_DECL <c>>>

 In this case, the GIMPLE form for this statement is logically identical
to its GENERIC form but in GIMPLE, the 'PLUS_EXPR' on the RHS of the
assignment is not represented as a tree, instead the two operands are
taken out of the 'PLUS_EXPR' sub-tree and flattened into the GIMPLE
tuple as follows:

     GIMPLE_ASSIGN <PLUS_EXPR, VAR_DECL <a>, VAR_DECL <b>, VAR_DECL <c>>

11.5.6 Operand vector allocation
--------------------------------

The operand vector is stored at the bottom of the three tuple structures
that accept operands.  This means, that depending on the code of a given
statement, its operand vector will be at different offsets from the base
of the structure.  To access tuple operands use the following accessors

 -- GIMPLE function: unsigned gimple_num_ops (gimple g)
     Returns the number of operands in statement G.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree gimple_op (gimple g, unsigned i)
     Returns operand 'I' from statement 'G'.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree * gimple_ops (gimple g)
     Returns a pointer into the operand vector for statement 'G'.  This
     is computed using an internal table called 'gimple_ops_offset_'[].
     This table is indexed by the gimple code of 'G'.

     When the compiler is built, this table is filled-in using the sizes
     of the structures used by each statement code defined in
     gimple.def.  Since the operand vector is at the bottom of the
     structure, for a gimple code 'C' the offset is computed as sizeof
     (struct-of 'C') - sizeof (tree).

     This mechanism adds one memory indirection to every access when
     using 'gimple_op'(), if this becomes a bottleneck, a pass can
     choose to memoize the result from 'gimple_ops'() and use that to
     access the operands.

11.5.7 Operand validation
-------------------------

When adding a new operand to a gimple statement, the operand will be
validated according to what each tuple accepts in its operand vector.
These predicates are called by the 'gimple_NAME_set_...()'.  Each tuple
will use one of the following predicates (Note, this list is not
exhaustive):

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_val (tree t)
     Returns true if t is a "GIMPLE value", which are all the
     non-addressable stack variables (variables for which
     'is_gimple_reg' returns true) and constants (expressions for which
     'is_gimple_min_invariant' returns true).

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_addressable (tree t)
     Returns true if t is a symbol or memory reference whose address can
     be taken.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_asm_val (tree t)
     Similar to 'is_gimple_val' but it also accepts hard registers.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_call_addr (tree t)
     Return true if t is a valid expression to use as the function
     called by a 'GIMPLE_CALL'.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_mem_ref_addr (tree t)
     Return true if t is a valid expression to use as first operand of a
     'MEM_REF' expression.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_constant (tree t)
     Return true if t is a valid gimple constant.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_min_invariant (tree t)
     Return true if t is a valid minimal invariant.  This is different
     from constants, in that the specific value of t may not be known at
     compile time, but it is known that it doesn't change (e.g., the
     address of a function local variable).

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_ip_invariant (tree t)
     Return true if t is an interprocedural invariant.  This means that
     t is a valid invariant in all functions (e.g.  it can be an address
     of a global variable but not of a local one).

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_ip_invariant_address (tree t)
     Return true if t is an 'ADDR_EXPR' that does not change once the
     program is running (and which is valid in all functions).

11.5.8 Statement validation
---------------------------

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_assign (gimple g)
     Return true if the code of g is 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN'.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_call (gimple g)
     Return true if the code of g is 'GIMPLE_CALL'.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_debug (gimple g)
     Return true if the code of g is 'GIMPLE_DEBUG'.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool gimple_assign_cast_p (gimple g)
     Return true if g is a 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN' that performs a type cast
     operation.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool gimple_debug_bind_p (gimple g)
     Return true if g is a 'GIMPLE_DEBUG' that binds the value of an
     expression to a variable.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool is_gimple_omp (gimple g)
     Return true if g is any of the OpenMP codes.

11.6 Manipulating GIMPLE statements
===================================

This section documents all the functions available to handle each of the
GIMPLE instructions.

11.6.1 Common accessors
-----------------------

The following are common accessors for gimple statements.

11.7.2 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN'
----------------------

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple gimple_build_assign (tree lhs, tree rhs)
     Build a 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN' statement.  The left-hand side is an lvalue
     passed in lhs.  The right-hand side can be either a unary or binary
     tree expression.  The expression tree rhs will be flattened and its
     operands assigned to the corresponding operand slots in the new
     statement.  This function is useful when you already have a tree
     expression that you want to convert into a tuple.  However, try to
     avoid building expression trees for the sole purpose of calling
     this function.  If you already have the operands in separate trees,
     it is better to use 'gimple_build_assign_with_ops'.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple gimplify_assign (tree dst, tree src,
          gimple_seq *seq_p)
     Build a new 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN' tuple and append it to the end of
     '*SEQ_P'.

 'DST'/'SRC' are the destination and source respectively.  You can pass
ungimplified trees in 'DST' or 'SRC', in which case they will be
converted to a gimple operand if necessary.

 This function returns the newly created 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN' tuple.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple gimple_build_assign_with_ops (enum tree_code
          subcode, tree lhs, tree op1, tree op2)
     This function is similar to 'gimple_build_assign', but is used to
     build a 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN' statement when the operands of the
     right-hand side of the assignment are already split into different
     operands.

     The left-hand side is an lvalue passed in lhs.  Subcode is the
     'tree_code' for the right-hand side of the assignment.  Op1 and op2
     are the operands.  If op2 is null, subcode must be a 'tree_code'
     for a unary expression.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree * gimple_assign_rhs3_ptr (gimple g)
     Return the address of the third operand on the 'RHS' of assignment

          ...)
     Build a 'GIMPLE_CALL' statement to function 'FN'.  The argument
     'FN' must be either a 'FUNCTION_DECL' or a gimple call address as
     determined by 'is_gimple_call_addr'.  'NARGS' are the number of
     arguments.  The rest of the arguments follow the argument 'NARGS',
     and must be trees that are valid as rvalues in gimple (i.e., each
     operand is validated with 'is_gimple_operand').

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple gimple_build_call_from_tree (tree call_expr)
     Build a 'GIMPLE_CALL' from a 'CALL_EXPR' node.  The arguments and
     the function are taken from the expression directly.  This routine

11.7.7 'GIMPLE_DEBUG'
---------------------

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple gimple_build_debug_bind (tree var, tree
          value, gimple stmt)
     Build a 'GIMPLE_DEBUG' statement with 'GIMPLE_DEBUG_BIND' of
     'subcode'.  The effect of this statement is to tell debug
     information generation machinery that the value of user variable
     'var' is given by 'value' at that point, and to remain with that
     value until 'var' runs out of scope, a dynamically-subsequent debug
     bind statement overrides the binding, or conflicting values reach a
     control flow merge point.  Even if components of the 'value'
     expression change afterwards, the variable is supposed to retain
     the same value, though not necessarily the same location.

     It is expected that 'var' be most often a tree for automatic user
     variables ('VAR_DECL' or 'PARM_DECL') that satisfy the requirements
     for gimple registers, but it may also be a tree for a scalarized
     component of a user variable ('ARRAY_REF', 'COMPONENT_REF'), or a
     debug temporary ('DEBUG_EXPR_DECL').

     As for 'value', it can be an arbitrary tree expression, but it is
     recommended that it be in a suitable form for a gimple assignment
     'RHS'.  It is not expected that user variables that could appear as
     'var' ever appear in 'value', because in the latter we'd have their
     'SSA_NAME's instead, but even if they were not in SSA form, user
     variables appearing in 'value' are to be regarded as part of the
     executable code space, whereas those in 'var' are to be regarded as
     part of the source code space.  There is no way to refer to the
     value bound to a user variable within a 'value' expression.

     If 'value' is 'GIMPLE_DEBUG_BIND_NOVALUE', debug information
     generation machinery is informed that the variable 'var' is
     unbound, i.e., that its value is indeterminate, which sometimes
     means it is really unavailable, and other times that the compiler
     could not keep track of it.

     Block and location information for the newly-created stmt are taken
     from 'stmt', if given.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree gimple_debug_bind_get_var (gimple stmt)
     Return the user variable VAR that is bound at 'stmt'.

     Return a pointer to the value expression that is bound to a user

          var)
     Modify the user variable bound at 'stmt' to VAR.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gimple_debug_bind_set_value (gimple stmt, tree
          var)
     Modify the value bound to the user variable bound at 'stmt' to
     VALUE.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gimple_debug_bind_reset_value (gimple stmt)
     Modify the value bound to the user variable bound at 'stmt' so that
     the variable becomes unbound.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool gimple_debug_bind_has_value_p (gimple stmt)
     Return 'TRUE' if 'stmt' binds a user variable to a value, and
     'FALSE' if it unbinds the variable.

11.8 GIMPLE sequences
=====================

GIMPLE sequences are the tuple equivalent of 'STATEMENT_LIST''s used in
'GENERIC'.  They are used to chain statements together, and when used in
conjunction with sequence iterators, provide a framework for iterating
through statements.

 GIMPLE sequences are of type struct 'gimple_sequence', but are more
commonly passed by reference to functions dealing with sequences.  The
type for a sequence pointer is 'gimple_seq' which is the same as struct
'gimple_sequence' *.  When declaring a local sequence, you can define a
local variable of type struct 'gimple_sequence'.  When declaring a
sequence allocated on the garbage collected heap, use the function
'gimple_seq_alloc' documented below.

 There are convenience functions for iterating through sequences in the
section entitled Sequence Iterators.

 Below is a list of functions to manipulate and query sequences.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gimple_seq_add_stmt (gimple_seq *seq, gimple
          g)
     Link a gimple statement to the end of the sequence *'SEQ' if 'G' is
     not 'NULL'.  If *'SEQ' is 'NULL', allocate a sequence before
     linking.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gimple_seq_add_seq (gimple_seq *dest,
          gimple_seq src)
     Append sequence 'SRC' to the end of sequence *'DEST' if 'SRC' is
     not 'NULL'.  If *'DEST' is 'NULL', allocate a new sequence before
     appending.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_seq gimple_seq_deep_copy (gimple_seq src)
     Perform a deep copy of sequence 'SRC' and return the result.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_seq gimple_seq_reverse (gimple_seq seq)
     Reverse the order of the statements in the sequence 'SEQ'.  Return

11.9 Sequence iterators
=======================

Sequence iterators are convenience constructs for iterating through
statements in a sequence.  Given a sequence 'SEQ', here is a typical use
of gimple sequence iterators:

     gimple_stmt_iterator gsi;

     for (gsi = gsi_start (seq); !gsi_end_p (gsi); gsi_next (&gsi))
       {
         gimple g = gsi_stmt (gsi);
         /* Do something with gimple statement G.  */
       }

 Backward iterations are possible:

             for (gsi = gsi_last (seq); !gsi_end_p (gsi); gsi_prev (&gsi))

 Forward and backward iterations on basic blocks are possible with
'gsi_start_bb' and 'gsi_last_bb'.

 In the documentation below we sometimes refer to enum
'gsi_iterator_update'.  The valid options for this enumeration are:

   * 'GSI_NEW_STMT' Only valid when a single statement is added.  Move
     the iterator to it.

   * 'GSI_SAME_STMT' Leave the iterator at the same statement.

   * 'GSI_CONTINUE_LINKING' Move iterator to whatever position is
     suitable for linking other statements in the same direction.

 Below is a list of the functions used to manipulate and use statement
iterators.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_stmt_iterator gsi_start (gimple_seq seq)
     Return a new iterator pointing to the sequence 'SEQ''s first
     statement.  If 'SEQ' is empty, the iterator's basic block is
     'NULL'.  Use 'gsi_start_bb' instead when the iterator needs to
     always have the correct basic block set.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_stmt_iterator gsi_start_bb (basic_block bb)
     Return a new iterator pointing to the first statement in basic
     block 'BB'.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_stmt_iterator gsi_last (gimple_seq seq)
     Return a new iterator initially pointing to the last statement of
     sequence 'SEQ'.  If 'SEQ' is empty, the iterator's basic block is
     'NULL'.  Use 'gsi_last_bb' instead when the iterator needs to
     always have the correct basic block set.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_stmt_iterator gsi_last_bb (basic_block bb)
     Return a new iterator pointing to the last statement in basic block
     'BB'.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool gsi_end_p (gimple_stmt_iterator i)
     Return 'TRUE' if at the end of 'I'.

 -- GIMPLE function: bool gsi_one_before_end_p (gimple_stmt_iterator i)
     Return 'TRUE' if we're one statement before the end of 'I'.

     Return the sequence associated with this iterator.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_remove (gimple_stmt_iterator *i, bool
          remove_eh_info)
     Remove the current stmt from the sequence.  The iterator is updated
     to point to the next statement.  When 'REMOVE_EH_INFO' is true we
     remove the statement pointed to by iterator 'I' from the 'EH'
     tables.  Otherwise we do not modify the 'EH' tables.  Generally,
     'REMOVE_EH_INFO' should be true when the statement is going to be
     removed from the 'IL' and not reinserted elsewhere.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_link_seq_before (gimple_stmt_iterator *i,
          gimple_seq seq, enum gsi_iterator_update mode)
     Links the sequence of statements 'SEQ' before the statement pointed
     by iterator 'I'.  'MODE' indicates what to do with the iterator
     after insertion (see 'enum gsi_iterator_update' above).

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_replace (gimple_stmt_iterator *i, gimple
          stmt, bool update_eh_info)
     Replace the statement pointed-to by 'I' to 'STMT'.  If
     'UPDATE_EH_INFO' is true, the exception handling information of the
     original statement is moved to the new statement.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_insert_before (gimple_stmt_iterator *i,
          gimple stmt, enum gsi_iterator_update mode)
     Insert statement 'STMT' before the statement pointed-to by iterator
     'I', update 'STMT''s basic block and scan it for new operands.
     'MODE' specifies how to update iterator 'I' after insertion (see
     enum 'gsi_iterator_update').

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_insert_seq_before (gimple_stmt_iterator
          *i, gimple_seq seq, enum gsi_iterator_update mode)
     Like 'gsi_insert_before', but for all the statements in 'SEQ'.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_insert_after (gimple_stmt_iterator *i,
          gimple stmt, enum gsi_iterator_update mode)
     Insert statement 'STMT' after the statement pointed-to by iterator
     'I', update 'STMT''s basic block and scan it for new operands.
     'MODE' specifies how to update iterator 'I' after insertion (see
     enum 'gsi_iterator_update').

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_insert_seq_after (gimple_stmt_iterator *i,
          gimple_seq seq, enum gsi_iterator_update mode)
     Like 'gsi_insert_after', but for all the statements in 'SEQ'.

 -- GIMPLE function: gimple_stmt_iterator gsi_for_stmt (gimple stmt)

     at 'TO'.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_move_before (gimple_stmt_iterator *from,
          gimple_stmt_iterator *to)
     Move the statement at 'FROM' so it comes right before the statement
     at 'TO'.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_move_to_bb_end (gimple_stmt_iterator
          *from, basic_block bb)
     Move the statement at 'FROM' to the end of basic block 'BB'.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_insert_on_edge (edge e, gimple stmt)
     Add 'STMT' to the pending list of edge 'E'.  No actual insertion is
     made until a call to 'gsi_commit_edge_inserts'() is made.

 -- GIMPLE function: void gsi_insert_seq_on_edge (edge e, gimple_seq
          seq)

          basic_block *new_bb)
     Commit insertions pending at edge 'E'.  If a new block is created,
     set 'NEW_BB' to this block, otherwise set it to 'NULL'.

11.10 Adding a new GIMPLE statement code
========================================

The first step in adding a new GIMPLE statement code, is modifying the
file 'gimple.def', which contains all the GIMPLE codes.  Then you must
add a corresponding structure, and an entry in 'union
gimple_statement_d', both of which are located in 'gimple.h'.  This in
turn, will require you to add a corresponding 'GTY' tag in
'gsstruct.def', and code to handle this tag in 'gss_for_code' which is
located in 'gimple.c'.

 In order for the garbage collector to know the size of the structure
you created in 'gimple.h', you need to add a case to handle your new
GIMPLE statement in 'gimple_size' which is located in 'gimple.c'.

 You will probably want to create a function to build the new gimple
statement in 'gimple.c'.  The function should be called
'gimple_build_NEW-TUPLE-NAME', and should return the new tuple of type
gimple.

 If your new statement requires accessors for any members or operands it
may have, put simple inline accessors in 'gimple.h' and any non-trivial
accessors in 'gimple.c' with a corresponding prototype in 'gimple.h'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Statement and operand traversals,  Prev: Adding a new GIMPLE statement code,  Up: GIMPLE

11.11 Statement and operand traversals
======================================

There are two functions available for walking statements and sequences:
'walk_gimple_stmt' and 'walk_gimple_seq', accordingly, and a third
function for walking the operands in a statement: 'walk_gimple_op'.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree walk_gimple_stmt (gimple_stmt_iterator *gsi,
          walk_stmt_fn callback_stmt, walk_tree_fn callback_op, struct
          walk_stmt_info *wi)
     This function is used to walk the current statement in 'GSI',
     optionally using traversal state stored in 'WI'.  If 'WI' is
     'NULL', no state is kept during the traversal.

     The callback 'CALLBACK_STMT' is called.  If 'CALLBACK_STMT' returns
     true, it means that the callback function has handled all the
     operands of the statement and it is not necessary to walk its
     operands.

     If 'CALLBACK_STMT' is 'NULL' or it returns false, 'CALLBACK_OP' is
     called on each operand of the statement via 'walk_gimple_op'.  If
     'walk_gimple_op' returns non-'NULL' for any operand, the remaining
     operands are not scanned.

     The return value is that returned by the last call to
     'walk_gimple_op', or 'NULL_TREE' if no 'CALLBACK_OP' is specified.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree walk_gimple_op (gimple stmt, walk_tree_fn
          callback_op, struct walk_stmt_info *wi)
     Use this function to walk the operands of statement 'STMT'.  Every
     operand is walked via 'walk_tree' with optional state information
     in 'WI'.

     'CALLBACK_OP' is called on each operand of 'STMT' via 'walk_tree'.
     Additional parameters to 'walk_tree' must be stored in 'WI'.  For
     each operand 'OP', 'walk_tree' is called as:

          walk_tree (&OP, CALLBACK_OP, WI, PSET)

     If 'CALLBACK_OP' returns non-'NULL' for an operand, the remaining
     operands are not scanned.  The return value is that returned by the
     last call to 'walk_tree', or 'NULL_TREE' if no 'CALLBACK_OP' is
     specified.

 -- GIMPLE function: tree walk_gimple_seq (gimple_seq seq, walk_stmt_fn
          callback_stmt, walk_tree_fn callback_op, struct walk_stmt_info
          *wi)
     This function walks all the statements in the sequence 'SEQ'
     calling 'walk_gimple_stmt' on each one.  'WI' is as in
     'walk_gimple_stmt'.  If 'walk_gimple_stmt' returns non-'NULL', the
     walk is stopped and the value returned.  Otherwise, all the
     statements are walked and 'NULL_TREE' returned.

12 Analysis and Optimization of GIMPLE tuples
*********************************************

GCC uses three main intermediate languages to represent the program
during compilation: GENERIC, GIMPLE and RTL.  GENERIC is a
language-independent representation generated by each front end.  It is
used to serve as an interface between the parser and optimizer.  GENERIC
is a common representation that is able to represent programs written in
all the languages supported by GCC.

 GIMPLE and RTL are used to optimize the program.  GIMPLE is used for
target and language independent optimizations (e.g., inlining, constant
propagation, tail call elimination, redundancy elimination, etc).  Much
like GENERIC, GIMPLE is a language independent, tree based
representation.  However, it differs from GENERIC in that the GIMPLE
grammar is more restrictive: expressions contain no more than 3 operands
(except function calls), it has no control flow structures and
expressions with side-effects are only allowed on the right hand side of
assignments.  See the chapter describing GENERIC and GIMPLE for more
details.

 This chapter describes the data structures and functions used in the
GIMPLE optimizers (also known as "tree optimizers" or "middle end").  In
particular, it focuses on all the macros, data structures, functions and
programming constructs needed to implement optimization passes for
GIMPLE.

12.1 Annotations
================

The optimizers need to associate attributes with variables during the
optimization process.  For instance, we need to know whether a variable
has aliases.  All these attributes are stored in data structures called
annotations which are then linked to the field 'ann' in 'struct
tree_common'.

12.2 SSA Operands
=================

Almost every GIMPLE statement will contain a reference to a variable or
memory location.  Since statements come in different shapes and sizes,
their operands are going to be located at various spots inside the
statement's tree.  To facilitate access to the statement's operands,
they are organized into lists associated inside each statement's
annotation.  Each element in an operand list is a pointer to a
'VAR_DECL', 'PARM_DECL' or 'SSA_NAME' tree node.  This provides a very
convenient way of examining and replacing operands.

 Data flow analysis and optimization is done on all tree nodes
representing variables.  Any node for which 'SSA_VAR_P' returns nonzero
is considered when scanning statement operands.  However, not all
'SSA_VAR_P' variables are processed in the same way.  For the purposes
of optimization, we need to distinguish between references to local
scalar variables and references to globals, statics, structures, arrays,
aliased variables, etc.  The reason is simple, the compiler can gather
complete data flow information for a local scalar.  On the other hand, a
global variable may be modified by a function call, it may not be
possible to keep track of all the elements of an array or the fields of
a structure, etc.

 The operand scanner gathers two kinds of operands: "real" and
"virtual".  An operand for which 'is_gimple_reg' returns true is
considered real, otherwise it is a virtual operand.  We also distinguish
between uses and definitions.  An operand is used if its value is loaded
by the statement (e.g., the operand at the RHS of an assignment).  If
the statement assigns a new value to the operand, the operand is
considered a definition (e.g., the operand at the LHS of an assignment).

 Virtual and real operands also have very different data flow
properties.  Real operands are unambiguous references to the full object
that they represent.  For instance, given

     {
       int a, b;
       a = b
     }

 Since 'a' and 'b' are non-aliased locals, the statement 'a = b' will
have one real definition and one real use because variable 'a' is
completely modified with the contents of variable 'b'.  Real definition
are also known as "killing definitions".  Similarly, the use of 'b'
reads all its bits.

 In contrast, virtual operands are used with variables that can have a
partial or ambiguous reference.  This includes structures, arrays,
globals, and aliased variables.  In these cases, we have two types of
definitions.  For globals, structures, and arrays, we can determine from
a statement whether a variable of these types has a killing definition.
If the variable does, then the statement is marked as having a "must
definition" of that variable.  However, if a statement is only defining
a part of the variable (i.e. a field in a structure), or if we know that
a statement might define the variable but we cannot say for sure, then
we mark that statement as having a "may definition".  For instance,
given

     {
       int a, b, *p;

       if (...)
         p = &a;
       else
         p = &b;
       *p = 5;
       return *p;
     }

 The assignment '*p = 5' may be a definition of 'a' or 'b'.  If we
cannot determine statically where 'p' is pointing to at the time of the
store operation, we create virtual definitions to mark that statement as
a potential definition site for 'a' and 'b'.  Memory loads are similarly
marked with virtual use operands.  Virtual operands are shown in tree
dumps right before the statement that contains them.  To request a tree
dump with virtual operands, use the '-vops' option to '-fdump-tree':

     {
       int a, b, *p;

       if (...)
         p = &a;
       else
         p = &b;
       # a = VDEF <a>
       # b = VDEF <b>
       *p = 5;

       # VUSE <a>
       # VUSE <b>
       return *p;
     }

 Notice that 'VDEF' operands have two copies of the referenced variable.
This indicates that this is not a killing definition of that variable.
In this case we refer to it as a "may definition" or "aliased store".
The presence of the second copy of the variable in the 'VDEF' operand
will become important when the function is converted into SSA form.
This will be used to link all the non-killing definitions to prevent
optimizations from making incorrect assumptions about them.

 Operands are updated as soon as the statement is finished via a call to
'update_stmt'.  If statement elements are changed via 'SET_USE' or
'SET_DEF', then no further action is required (i.e., those macros take
care of updating the statement).  If changes are made by manipulating
the statement's tree directly, then a call must be made to 'update_stmt'
when complete.  Calling one of the 'bsi_insert' routines or
'bsi_replace' performs an implicit call to 'update_stmt'.

12.2.1 Operand Iterators And Access Routines
--------------------------------------------

Operands are collected by 'tree-ssa-operands.c'.  They are stored inside
each statement's annotation and can be accessed through either the
operand iterators or an access routine.

 The following access routines are available for examining operands:

  1. 'SINGLE_SSA_{USE,DEF,TREE}_OPERAND': These accessors will return
     NULL unless there is exactly one operand matching the specified
     flags.  If there is exactly one operand, the operand is returned as
     either a 'tree', 'def_operand_p', or 'use_operand_p'.

          tree t = SINGLE_SSA_TREE_OPERAND (stmt, flags);
          use_operand_p u = SINGLE_SSA_USE_OPERAND (stmt, SSA_ALL_VIRTUAL_USES);
          def_operand_p d = SINGLE_SSA_DEF_OPERAND (stmt, SSA_OP_ALL_DEFS);

  2. 'ZERO_SSA_OPERANDS': This macro returns true if there are no
     operands matching the specified flags.

          if (ZERO_SSA_OPERANDS (stmt, SSA_OP_ALL_VIRTUALS))
            return;

  3. 'NUM_SSA_OPERANDS': This macro Returns the number of operands
     matching 'flags'.  This actually executes a loop to perform the
     count, so only use this if it is really needed.

          int count = NUM_SSA_OPERANDS (stmt, flags)

 If you wish to iterate over some or all operands, use the
'FOR_EACH_SSA_{USE,DEF,TREE}_OPERAND' iterator.  For example, to print
all the operands for a statement:

     void
     print_ops (tree stmt)
     {
       ssa_op_iter;
       tree var;

       FOR_EACH_SSA_TREE_OPERAND (var, stmt, iter, SSA_OP_ALL_OPERANDS)
         print_generic_expr (stderr, var, TDF_SLIM);
     }

 How to choose the appropriate iterator:

  1. Determine whether you are need to see the operand pointers, or just
     the trees, and choose the appropriate macro:

          Need            Macro:
          ----            -------
          use_operand_p   FOR_EACH_SSA_USE_OPERAND
          def_operand_p   FOR_EACH_SSA_DEF_OPERAND
          tree            FOR_EACH_SSA_TREE_OPERAND

  2. You need to declare a variable of the type you are interested in,
     and an ssa_op_iter structure which serves as the loop controlling
     variable.

  3. Determine which operands you wish to use, and specify the flags of
     those you are interested in.  They are documented in
     'tree-ssa-operands.h':

          #define SSA_OP_USE              0x01    /* Real USE operands.  */
          #define SSA_OP_DEF              0x02    /* Real DEF operands.  */
          #define SSA_OP_VUSE             0x04    /* VUSE operands.  */
          #define SSA_OP_VDEF             0x08    /* VDEF operands.  */

          /* These are commonly grouped operand flags.  */
          #define SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_USES	(SSA_OP_VUSE)
          #define SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_DEFS	(SSA_OP_VDEF)
          #define SSA_OP_ALL_VIRTUALS     (SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_USES | SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_DEFS)
          #define SSA_OP_ALL_USES		(SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_USES | SSA_OP_USE)
          #define SSA_OP_ALL_DEFS		(SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_DEFS | SSA_OP_DEF)
          #define SSA_OP_ALL_OPERANDS	(SSA_OP_ALL_USES | SSA_OP_ALL_DEFS)

 So if you want to look at the use pointers for all the 'USE' and 'VUSE'
operands, you would do something like:

       use_operand_p use_p;
       ssa_op_iter iter;

       FOR_EACH_SSA_USE_OPERAND (use_p, stmt, iter, (SSA_OP_USE | SSA_OP_VUSE))
         {
           process_use_ptr (use_p);
         }

 The 'TREE' macro is basically the same as the 'USE' and 'DEF' macros,
only with the use or def dereferenced via 'USE_FROM_PTR (use_p)' and
'DEF_FROM_PTR (def_p)'.  Since we aren't using operand pointers, use and
defs flags can be mixed.

       tree var;
       ssa_op_iter iter;

       FOR_EACH_SSA_TREE_OPERAND (var, stmt, iter, SSA_OP_VUSE)
         {
            print_generic_expr (stderr, var, TDF_SLIM);
         }

 'VDEF's are broken into two flags, one for the 'DEF' portion
('SSA_OP_VDEF') and one for the USE portion ('SSA_OP_VUSE').

 There are many examples in the code, in addition to the documentation
in 'tree-ssa-operands.h' and 'ssa-iterators.h'.

 There are also a couple of variants on the stmt iterators regarding PHI
nodes.

 'FOR_EACH_PHI_ARG' Works exactly like 'FOR_EACH_SSA_USE_OPERAND',
except it works over 'PHI' arguments instead of statement operands.

     /* Look at every virtual PHI use.  */
     FOR_EACH_PHI_ARG (use_p, phi_stmt, iter, SSA_OP_VIRTUAL_USES)
     {
        my_code;
     }

     /* Look at every real PHI use.  */
     FOR_EACH_PHI_ARG (use_p, phi_stmt, iter, SSA_OP_USES)
       my_code;

     /* Look at every PHI use.  */
     FOR_EACH_PHI_ARG (use_p, phi_stmt, iter, SSA_OP_ALL_USES)
       my_code;

 'FOR_EACH_PHI_OR_STMT_{USE,DEF}' works exactly like
'FOR_EACH_SSA_{USE,DEF}_OPERAND', except it will function on either a
statement or a 'PHI' node.  These should be used when it is appropriate
but they are not quite as efficient as the individual 'FOR_EACH_PHI' and
'FOR_EACH_SSA' routines.

     FOR_EACH_PHI_OR_STMT_USE (use_operand_p, stmt, iter, flags)
       {
          my_code;
       }

     FOR_EACH_PHI_OR_STMT_DEF (def_operand_p, phi, iter, flags)
       {
          my_code;
       }

12.2.2 Immediate Uses
---------------------

Immediate use information is now always available.  Using the immediate
use iterators, you may examine every use of any 'SSA_NAME'.  For
instance, to change each use of 'ssa_var' to 'ssa_var2' and call
fold_stmt on each stmt after that is done:

       use_operand_p imm_use_p;
       imm_use_iterator iterator;
       tree ssa_var, stmt;


       FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_STMT (stmt, iterator, ssa_var)
         {
           FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_ON_STMT (imm_use_p, iterator)
             SET_USE (imm_use_p, ssa_var_2);
           fold_stmt (stmt);
         }

 There are 2 iterators which can be used.  'FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_FAST' is
used when the immediate uses are not changed, i.e., you are looking at
the uses, but not setting them.

 If they do get changed, then care must be taken that things are not
changed under the iterators, so use the 'FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_STMT' and
'FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_ON_STMT' iterators.  They attempt to preserve the
sanity of the use list by moving all the uses for a statement into a
controlled position, and then iterating over those uses.  Then the
optimization can manipulate the stmt when all the uses have been
processed.  This is a little slower than the FAST version since it adds
a placeholder element and must sort through the list a bit for each
statement.  This placeholder element must be also be removed if the loop
is terminated early.  The macro 'BREAK_FROM_IMM_USE_SAFE' is provided to
do this :

       FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_STMT (stmt, iterator, ssa_var)
         {
           if (stmt == last_stmt)
             BREAK_FROM_SAFE_IMM_USE (iter);

           FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_ON_STMT (imm_use_p, iterator)
             SET_USE (imm_use_p, ssa_var_2);
           fold_stmt (stmt);
         }

 There are checks in 'verify_ssa' which verify that the immediate use
list is up to date, as well as checking that an optimization didn't
break from the loop without using this macro.  It is safe to simply
'break'; from a 'FOR_EACH_IMM_USE_FAST' traverse.

 Some useful functions and macros:
  1. 'has_zero_uses (ssa_var)' : Returns true if there are no uses of
     'ssa_var'.
  2. 'has_single_use (ssa_var)' : Returns true if there is only a single
     use of 'ssa_var'.
  3. 'single_imm_use (ssa_var, use_operand_p *ptr, tree *stmt)' :
     Returns true if there is only a single use of 'ssa_var', and also
     returns the use pointer and statement it occurs in, in the second
     and third parameters.
  4. 'num_imm_uses (ssa_var)' : Returns the number of immediate uses of
     'ssa_var'.  It is better not to use this if possible since it
     simply utilizes a loop to count the uses.
  5. 'PHI_ARG_INDEX_FROM_USE (use_p)' : Given a use within a 'PHI' node,
     return the index number for the use.  An assert is triggered if the
     use isn't located in a 'PHI' node.
  6. 'USE_STMT (use_p)' : Return the statement a use occurs in.

 Note that uses are not put into an immediate use list until their
statement is actually inserted into the instruction stream via a 'bsi_*'
routine.

 It is also still possible to utilize lazy updating of statements, but
this should be used only when absolutely required.  Both alias analysis
and the dominator optimizations currently do this.

 When lazy updating is being used, the immediate use information is out
of date and cannot be used reliably.  Lazy updating is achieved by
simply marking statements modified via calls to 'mark_stmt_modified'
instead of 'update_stmt'.  When lazy updating is no longer required, all
the modified statements must have 'update_stmt' called in order to bring
them up to date.  This must be done before the optimization is finished,
or 'verify_ssa' will trigger an abort.

 This is done with a simple loop over the instruction stream:
       block_stmt_iterator bsi;
       basic_block bb;
       FOR_EACH_BB (bb)
         {
           for (bsi = bsi_start (bb); !bsi_end_p (bsi); bsi_next (&bsi))
             update_stmt_if_modified (bsi_stmt (bsi));
         }

12.3 Static Single Assignment
=============================

Most of the tree optimizers rely on the data flow information provided
by the Static Single Assignment (SSA) form.  We implement the SSA form
as described in 'R. Cytron, J. Ferrante, B. Rosen, M. Wegman, and K.
Zadeck. Efficiently Computing Static Single Assignment Form and the
Control Dependence Graph. ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and
Systems, 13(4):451-490, October 1991'.

 The SSA form is based on the premise that program variables are
assigned in exactly one location in the program.  Multiple assignments
to the same variable create new versions of that variable.  Naturally,
actual programs are seldom in SSA form initially because variables tend
to be assigned multiple times.  The compiler modifies the program
representation so that every time a variable is assigned in the code, a
new version of the variable is created.  Different versions of the same
variable are distinguished by subscripting the variable name with its
version number.  Variables used in the right-hand side of expressions
are renamed so that their version number matches that of the most recent
assignment.

 We represent variable versions using 'SSA_NAME' nodes.  The renaming
process in 'tree-ssa.c' wraps every real and virtual operand with an
'SSA_NAME' node which contains the version number and the statement that
created the 'SSA_NAME'.  Only definitions and virtual definitions may
create new 'SSA_NAME' nodes.

 Sometimes, flow of control makes it impossible to determine the most
recent version of a variable.  In these cases, the compiler inserts an
artificial definition for that variable called "PHI function" or "PHI
node".  This new definition merges all the incoming versions of the
variable to create a new name for it.  For instance,

     if (...)
       a_1 = 5;
     else if (...)
       a_2 = 2;
     else
       a_3 = 13;

     # a_4 = PHI <a_1, a_2, a_3>
     return a_4;

 Since it is not possible to determine which of the three branches will
be taken at runtime, we don't know which of 'a_1', 'a_2' or 'a_3' to use
at the return statement.  So, the SSA renamer creates a new version
'a_4' which is assigned the result of "merging" 'a_1', 'a_2' and 'a_3'.
Hence, PHI nodes mean "one of these operands.  I don't know which".

 The following functions can be used to examine PHI nodes

 -- Function: gimple_phi_result (PHI)
     Returns the 'SSA_NAME' created by PHI node PHI (i.e., PHI's LHS).

 -- Function: gimple_phi_num_args (PHI)
     Returns the number of arguments in PHI.  This number is exactly the
     number of incoming edges to the basic block holding PHI.

 -- Function: gimple_phi_arg (PHI, I)
     Returns Ith argument of PHI.

 -- Function: gimple_phi_arg_edge (PHI, I)
     Returns the incoming edge for the Ith argument of PHI.

 -- Function: gimple_phi_arg_def (PHI, I)
     Returns the 'SSA_NAME' for the Ith argument of PHI.

12.3.1 Preserving the SSA form
------------------------------

Some optimization passes make changes to the function that invalidate
the SSA property.  This can happen when a pass has added new symbols or
changed the program so that variables that were previously aliased
aren't anymore.  Whenever something like this happens, the affected
symbols must be renamed into SSA form again.  Transformations that emit
new code or replicate existing statements will also need to update the
SSA form.

 Since GCC implements two different SSA forms for register and virtual
variables, keeping the SSA form up to date depends on whether you are
updating register or virtual names.  In both cases, the general idea
behind incremental SSA updates is similar: when new SSA names are
created, they typically are meant to replace other existing names in the
program.

 For instance, given the following code:

          1  L0:
          2  x_1 = PHI (0, x_5)
          3  if (x_1 < 10)
          4    if (x_1 > 7)
          5      y_2 = 0
          6    else
          7      y_3 = x_1 + x_7
          8    endif
          9    x_5 = x_1 + 1
          10   goto L0;
          11 endif

 Suppose that we insert new names 'x_10' and 'x_11' (lines '4' and '8').

          1  L0:
          2  x_1 = PHI (0, x_5)
          3  if (x_1 < 10)
          4    x_10 = ...
          5    if (x_1 > 7)
          6      y_2 = 0
          7    else
          8      x_11 = ...
          9      y_3 = x_1 + x_7
          10   endif
          11   x_5 = x_1 + 1
          12   goto L0;
          13 endif

 We want to replace all the uses of 'x_1' with the new definitions of
'x_10' and 'x_11'.  Note that the only uses that should be replaced are
those at lines '5', '9' and '11'.  Also, the use of 'x_7' at line '9'
should _not_ be replaced (this is why we cannot just mark symbol 'x' for
renaming).

 Additionally, we may need to insert a PHI node at line '11' because
that is a merge point for 'x_10' and 'x_11'.  So the use of 'x_1' at
line '11' will be replaced with the new PHI node.  The insertion of PHI
nodes is optional.  They are not strictly necessary to preserve the SSA
form, and depending on what the caller inserted, they may not even be
useful for the optimizers.

 Updating the SSA form is a two step process.  First, the pass has to
identify which names need to be updated and/or which symbols need to be
renamed into SSA form for the first time.  When new names are introduced
to replace existing names in the program, the mapping between the old
and the new names are registered by calling 'register_new_name_mapping'
(note that if your pass creates new code by duplicating basic blocks,
the call to 'tree_duplicate_bb' will set up the necessary mappings
automatically).

 After the replacement mappings have been registered and new symbols
marked for renaming, a call to 'update_ssa' makes the registered
changes.  This can be done with an explicit call or by creating 'TODO'
flags in the 'tree_opt_pass' structure for your pass.  There are several
'TODO' flags that control the behavior of 'update_ssa':

   * 'TODO_update_ssa'.  Update the SSA form inserting PHI nodes for
     newly exposed symbols and virtual names marked for updating.  When
     updating real names, only insert PHI nodes for a real name 'O_j' in
     blocks reached by all the new and old definitions for 'O_j'.  If
     the iterated dominance frontier for 'O_j' is not pruned, we may end
     up inserting PHI nodes in blocks that have one or more edges with
     no incoming definition for 'O_j'.  This would lead to uninitialized
     warnings for 'O_j''s symbol.

   * 'TODO_update_ssa_no_phi'.  Update the SSA form without inserting
     any new PHI nodes at all.  This is used by passes that have either
     inserted all the PHI nodes themselves or passes that need only to
     patch use-def and def-def chains for virtuals (e.g., DCE).

   * 'TODO_update_ssa_full_phi'.  Insert PHI nodes everywhere they are
     needed.  No pruning of the IDF is done.  This is used by passes
     that need the PHI nodes for 'O_j' even if it means that some
     arguments will come from the default definition of 'O_j''s symbol
     (e.g., 'pass_linear_transform').

     WARNING: If you need to use this flag, chances are that your pass
     may be doing something wrong.  Inserting PHI nodes for an old name
     where not all edges carry a new replacement may lead to silent
     codegen errors or spurious uninitialized warnings.

   * 'TODO_update_ssa_only_virtuals'.  Passes that update the SSA form
     on their own may want to delegate the updating of virtual names to
     the generic updater.  Since FUD chains are easier to maintain, this
     simplifies the work they need to do.  NOTE: If this flag is used,
     any OLD->NEW mappings for real names are explicitly destroyed and
     only the symbols marked for renaming are processed.

12.3.2 Preserving the virtual SSA form
--------------------------------------

The virtual SSA form is harder to preserve than the non-virtual SSA form
mainly because the set of virtual operands for a statement may change at
what some would consider unexpected times.  In general, statement
modifications should be bracketed between calls to 'push_stmt_changes'
and 'pop_stmt_changes'.  For example,

         munge_stmt (tree stmt)
         {
            push_stmt_changes (&stmt);
            ... rewrite STMT ...
            pop_stmt_changes (&stmt);
         }

 The call to 'push_stmt_changes' saves the current state of the
statement operands and the call to 'pop_stmt_changes' compares the saved
state with the current one and does the appropriate symbol marking for
the SSA renamer.

 It is possible to modify several statements at a time, provided that
'push_stmt_changes' and 'pop_stmt_changes' are called in LIFO order, as
when processing a stack of statements.

 Additionally, if the pass discovers that it did not need to make
changes to the statement after calling 'push_stmt_changes', it can
simply discard the topmost change buffer by calling
'discard_stmt_changes'.  This will avoid the expensive operand re-scan
operation and the buffer comparison that determines if symbols need to
be marked for renaming.

12.3.3 Examining 'SSA_NAME' nodes
---------------------------------

The following macros can be used to examine 'SSA_NAME' nodes

 -- Macro: SSA_NAME_DEF_STMT (VAR)
     Returns the statement S that creates the 'SSA_NAME' VAR.  If S is
     an empty statement (i.e., 'IS_EMPTY_STMT (S)' returns 'true'), it
     means that the first reference to this variable is a USE or a VUSE.

 -- Macro: SSA_NAME_VERSION (VAR)
     Returns the version number of the 'SSA_NAME' object VAR.

12.3.4 Walking the dominator tree
---------------------------------

 -- Tree SSA function: void walk_dominator_tree (WALK_DATA, BB)

     This function walks the dominator tree for the current CFG calling
     a set of callback functions defined in STRUCT DOM_WALK_DATA in
     'domwalk.h'.  The call back functions you need to define give you
     hooks to execute custom code at various points during traversal:

       1. Once to initialize any local data needed while processing BB
          and its children.  This local data is pushed into an internal
          stack which is automatically pushed and popped as the walker
          traverses the dominator tree.

       2. Once before traversing all the statements in the BB.

       3. Once for every statement inside BB.

       4. Once after traversing all the statements and before recursing
          into BB's dominator children.

       5. It then recurses into all the dominator children of BB.

       6. After recursing into all the dominator children of BB it can,
          optionally, traverse every statement in BB again (i.e.,
          repeating steps 2 and 3).

       7. Once after walking the statements in BB and BB's dominator
          children.  At this stage, the block local data stack is
          popped.

12.4 Alias analysis
===================

Alias analysis in GIMPLE SSA form consists of two pieces.  First the
virtual SSA web ties conflicting memory accesses and provides a SSA
use-def chain and SSA immediate-use chains for walking possibly
dependent memory accesses.  Second an alias-oracle can be queried to
disambiguate explicit and implicit memory references.

  1. Memory SSA form.

     All statements that may use memory have exactly one accompanied use
     of a virtual SSA name that represents the state of memory at the
     given point in the IL.

     All statements that may define memory have exactly one accompanied
     definition of a virtual SSA name using the previous state of memory
     and defining the new state of memory after the given point in the
     IL.

          int i;
          int foo (void)
          {
            # .MEM_3 = VDEF <.MEM_2(D)>
            i = 1;
            # VUSE <.MEM_3>
            return i;
          }

     The virtual SSA names in this case are '.MEM_2(D)' and '.MEM_3'.
     The store to the global variable 'i' defines '.MEM_3' invalidating
     '.MEM_2(D)'.  The load from 'i' uses that new state '.MEM_3'.

     The virtual SSA web serves as constraints to SSA optimizers
     preventing illegitimate code-motion and optimization.  It also
     provides a way to walk related memory statements.

  2. Points-to and escape analysis.

     Points-to analysis builds a set of constraints from the GIMPLE SSA
     IL representing all pointer operations and facts we do or do not
     know about pointers.  Solving this set of constraints yields a
     conservatively correct solution for each pointer variable in the
     program (though we are only interested in SSA name pointers) as to
     what it may possibly point to.

     This points-to solution for a given SSA name pointer is stored in
     the 'pt_solution' sub-structure of the 'SSA_NAME_PTR_INFO' record.
     The following accessor functions are available:

        * 'pt_solution_includes'
        * 'pt_solutions_intersect'

     Points-to analysis also computes the solution for two special set
     of pointers, 'ESCAPED' and 'CALLUSED'.  Those represent all memory
     that has escaped the scope of analysis or that is used by pure or
     nested const calls.

  3. Type-based alias analysis

     Type-based alias analysis is frontend dependent though generic
     support is provided by the middle-end in 'alias.c'.  TBAA code is
     used by both tree optimizers and RTL optimizers.

     Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias
     analysis should define a function that computes, given a 'tree'
     node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are
     not allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function
     'c_get_alias_set'.

  4. Tree alias-oracle

     The tree alias-oracle provides means to disambiguate two memory
     references and memory references against statements.  The following
     queries are available:

        * 'refs_may_alias_p'
        * 'ref_maybe_used_by_stmt_p'
        * 'stmt_may_clobber_ref_p'

     In addition to those two kind of statement walkers are available
     walking statements related to a reference ref.
     'walk_non_aliased_vuses' walks over dominating memory defining
     statements and calls back if the statement does not clobber ref
     providing the non-aliased VUSE. The walk stops at the first
     clobbering statement or if asked to.  'walk_aliased_vdefs' walks
     over dominating memory defining statements and calls back on each
     statement clobbering ref providing its aliasing VDEF. The walk
     stops if asked to.

12.5 Memory model
=================

The memory model used by the middle-end models that of the C/C++
languages.  The middle-end has the notion of an effective type of a
memory region which is used for type-based alias analysis.

 The following is a refinement of ISO C99 6.5/6, clarifying the block
copy case to follow common sense and extending the concept of a dynamic
effective type to objects with a declared type as required for C++.

     The effective type of an object for an access to its stored value is
     the declared type of the object or the effective type determined by
     a previous store to it.  If a value is stored into an object through
     an lvalue having a type that is not a character type, then the
     type of the lvalue becomes the effective type of the object for that
     access and for subsequent accesses that do not modify the stored value.
     If a value is copied into an object using memcpy or memmove,
     or is copied as an array of character type, then the effective type
     of the modified object for that access and for subsequent accesses that
     do not modify the value is undetermined.  For all other accesses to an
     object, the effective type of the object is simply the type of the
     lvalue used for the access.

13 RTL Representation
*********************

The last part of the compiler work is done on a low-level intermediate
representation called Register Transfer Language.  In this language, the
instructions to be output are described, pretty much one by one, in an
algebraic form that describes what the instruction does.

 RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made up
of structures that point at other structures, and a textual form that is
used in the machine description and in printed debugging dumps.  The
textual form uses nested parentheses to indicate the pointers in the
internal form.

13.1 RTL Object Types
=====================

RTL uses five kinds of objects: expressions, integers, wide integers,
strings and vectors.  Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL
expression ("RTX", for short) is a C structure, but it is usually
referred to with a pointer; a type that is given the typedef name 'rtx'.

 An integer is simply an 'int'; their written form uses decimal digits.
A wide integer is an integral object whose type is 'HOST_WIDE_INT';
their written form uses decimal digits.

 A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a
'char *' in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well.
However, strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty string
in a machine description, it is represented in core as a null pointer
rather than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain contexts,
these null pointers instead of strings are valid.  Within RTL code,
strings are most commonly found inside 'symbol_ref' expressions, but
they appear in other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up
machine descriptions.

 In a machine description, strings are normally written with double
quotes, as you would in C.  However, strings in machine descriptions may
extend over many lines, which is invalid C, and adjacent string
constants are not concatenated as they are in C.  Any string constant
may be surrounded with a single set of parentheses.  Sometimes this
makes the machine description easier to read.

 There is also a special syntax for strings, which can be useful when C
code is embedded in a machine description.  Wherever a string can
appear, it is also valid to write a C-style brace block.  The entire
brace block, including the outermost pair of braces, is considered to be
the string constant.  Double quote characters inside the braces are not
special.  Therefore, if you write string constants in the C code, you
need not escape each quote character with a backslash.

 A vector contains an arbitrary number of pointers to expressions.  The
number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in the vector.
The written form of a vector consists of square brackets ('[...]')
surrounding the elements, in sequence and with whitespace separating
them.  Vectors of length zero are not created; null pointers are used
instead.

 Expressions are classified by "expression codes" (also called RTX
codes).  The expression code is a name defined in 'rtl.def', which is
also (in uppercase) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression
codes and their meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX
can be extracted with the macro 'GET_CODE (X)' and altered with
'PUT_CODE (X, NEWCODE)'.

 The expression code determines how many operands the expression
contains, and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you
cannot tell by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.
Instead, you must know from its context--from the expression code of the
containing expression.  For example, in an expression of code 'subreg',
the first operand is to be regarded as an expression and the second
operand as an integer.  In an expression of code 'plus', there are two
operands, both of which are to be regarded as expressions.  In a
'symbol_ref' expression, there is one operand, which is to be regarded
as a string.

 Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the
operands of the expression (separated by spaces).

 Expression code names in the 'md' file are written in lowercase, but
when they appear in C code they are written in uppercase.  In this
manual, they are shown as follows: 'const_int'.

 In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is
normally wanted.  The written form of this is '(nil)'.

13.2 RTL Classes and Formats
============================

The various expression codes are divided into several "classes", which
are represented by single characters.  You can determine the class of an
RTX code with the macro 'GET_RTX_CLASS (CODE)'.  Currently, 'rtl.def'
defines these classes:

'RTX_OBJ'
     An RTX code that represents an actual object, such as a register
     ('REG') or a memory location ('MEM', 'SYMBOL_REF').  'LO_SUM') is
     also included; instead, 'SUBREG' and 'STRICT_LOW_PART' are not in
     this class, but in class 'x'.

'RTX_CONST_OBJ'
     An RTX code that represents a constant object.  'HIGH' is also
     included in this class.

'RTX_COMPARE'
     An RTX code for a non-symmetric comparison, such as 'GEU' or 'LT'.

'RTX_COMM_COMPARE'
     An RTX code for a symmetric (commutative) comparison, such as 'EQ'
     or 'ORDERED'.

'RTX_UNARY'
     An RTX code for a unary arithmetic operation, such as 'NEG', 'NOT',
     or 'ABS'.  This category also includes value extension (sign or
     zero) and conversions between integer and floating point.

'RTX_COMM_ARITH'
     An RTX code for a commutative binary operation, such as 'PLUS' or
     'AND'.  'NE' and 'EQ' are comparisons, so they have class '<'.

'RTX_BIN_ARITH'
     An RTX code for a non-commutative binary operation, such as
     'MINUS', 'DIV', or 'ASHIFTRT'.

'RTX_BITFIELD_OPS'
     An RTX code for a bit-field operation.  Currently only
     'ZERO_EXTRACT' and 'SIGN_EXTRACT'.  These have three inputs and are
     lvalues (so they can be used for insertion as well).  *Note
     Bit-Fields::.

'RTX_TERNARY'
     An RTX code for other three input operations.  Currently only
     'IF_THEN_ELSE', 'VEC_MERGE', 'SIGN_EXTRACT', 'ZERO_EXTRACT', and
     'FMA'.

'RTX_INSN'
     An RTX code for an entire instruction: 'INSN', 'JUMP_INSN', and
     'CALL_INSN'.  *Note Insns::.

'RTX_MATCH'
     An RTX code for something that matches in insns, such as
     'MATCH_DUP'.  These only occur in machine descriptions.

'RTX_AUTOINC'
     An RTX code for an auto-increment addressing mode, such as
     'POST_INC'.

'RTX_EXTRA'
     All other RTX codes.  This category includes the remaining codes
     used only in machine descriptions ('DEFINE_*', etc.).  It also
     includes all the codes describing side effects ('SET', 'USE',
     'CLOBBER', etc.)  and the non-insns that may appear on an insn
     chain, such as 'NOTE', 'BARRIER', and 'CODE_LABEL'.  'SUBREG' is
     also part of this class.

 For each expression code, 'rtl.def' specifies the number of contained
objects and their kinds using a sequence of characters called the
"format" of the expression code.  For example, the format of 'subreg' is
'ei'.

 These are the most commonly used format characters:

'e'
     An expression (actually a pointer to an expression).

'i'
     An integer.

'w'
     A wide integer.

's'
     A string.

'E'
     A vector of expressions.

 A few other format characters are used occasionally:

'u'
     'u' is equivalent to 'e' except that it is printed differently in
     debugging dumps.  It is used for pointers to insns.

'n'
     'n' is equivalent to 'i' except that it is printed differently in
     debugging dumps.  It is used for the line number or code number of
     a 'note' insn.

'S'
     'S' indicates a string which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
     core, 'S' is equivalent to 's', but when the object is read, from
     an 'md' file, the string value of this operand may be omitted.  An
     omitted string is taken to be the null string.

'V'
     'V' indicates a vector which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
     core, 'V' is equivalent to 'E', but when the object is read from an
     'md' file, the vector value of this operand may be omitted.  An
     omitted vector is effectively the same as a vector of no elements.

'B'
     'B' indicates a pointer to basic block structure.

'0'
     '0' means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category.
     '0' slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in
     special ways by small parts of the compiler.

 There are macros to get the number of operands and the format of an
expression code:

'GET_RTX_LENGTH (CODE)'
     Number of operands of an RTX of code CODE.

'GET_RTX_FORMAT (CODE)'
     The format of an RTX of code CODE, as a C string.

 Some classes of RTX codes always have the same format.  For example, it
is safe to assume that all comparison operations have format 'ee'.

'1'
     All codes of this class have format 'e'.

'<'
'c'
'2'
     All codes of these classes have format 'ee'.

'b'
'3'
     All codes of these classes have format 'eee'.

'i'
     All codes of this class have formats that begin with 'iuueiee'.
     *Note Insns::.  Note that not all RTL objects linked onto an insn
     chain are of class 'i'.

'o'
'm'
'x'
     You can make no assumptions about the format of these codes.

13.3 Access to Operands
=======================

Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros 'XEXP', 'XINT',
'XWINT' and 'XSTR'.  Each of these macros takes two arguments: an
expression-pointer (RTX) and an operand number (counting from zero).
Thus,

     XEXP (X, 2)

accesses operand 2 of expression X, as an expression.

     XINT (X, 2)

accesses the same operand as an integer.  'XSTR', used in the same
fashion, would access it as a string.

 Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a
string.  You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of
value actually stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the
expression code of the containing expression.  That is also how you
would know how many operands there are.

 For example, if X is a 'subreg' expression, you know that it has two
operands which can be correctly accessed as 'XEXP (X, 0)' and 'XINT (X,
1)'.  If you did 'XINT (X, 0)', you would get the address of the
expression operand but cast as an integer; that might occasionally be
useful, but it would be cleaner to write '(int) XEXP (X, 0)'.  'XEXP (X,
1)' would also compile without error, and would return the second,
integer operand cast as an expression pointer, which would probably
result in a crash when accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing 'XEXP
(X, 28)' either, but this will access memory past the end of the
expression with unpredictable results.

 Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can use
the macro 'XVEC' to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros
'XVECEXP' and 'XVECLEN' to access the elements and length of a vector.

'XVEC (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the vector-pointer which is operand number IDX in EXP.

'XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is in
     operand number IDX in EXP.  This value is an 'int'.

'XVECEXP (EXP, IDX, ELTNUM)'
     Access element number ELTNUM in the vector which is in operand
     number IDX in EXP.  This value is an RTX.

     It is up to you to make sure that ELTNUM is not negative and is
     less than 'XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'.

 All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and
therefore can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector
elements as well as to access them.

13.4 Access to Special Operands
===============================

Some RTL nodes have special annotations associated with them.

'MEM'
     'MEM_ALIAS_SET (X)'
          If 0, X is not in any alias set, and may alias anything.
          Otherwise, X can only alias 'MEM's in a conflicting alias set.
          This value is set in a language-dependent manner in the
          front-end, and should not be altered in the back-end.  In some
          front-ends, these numbers may correspond in some way to types,
          or other language-level entities, but they need not, and the
          back-end makes no such assumptions.  These set numbers are
          tested with 'alias_sets_conflict_p'.

     'MEM_EXPR (X)'
          If this register is known to hold the value of some user-level
          declaration, this is that tree node.  It may also be a
          'COMPONENT_REF', in which case this is some field reference,
          and 'TREE_OPERAND (X, 0)' contains the declaration, or another
          'COMPONENT_REF', or null if there is no compile-time object
          associated with the reference.

     'MEM_OFFSET_KNOWN_P (X)'
          True if the offset of the memory reference from 'MEM_EXPR' is
          known.  'MEM_OFFSET (X)' provides the offset if so.

     'MEM_OFFSET (X)'
          The offset from the start of 'MEM_EXPR'.  The value is only
          valid if 'MEM_OFFSET_KNOWN_P (X)' is true.

     'MEM_SIZE_KNOWN_P (X)'
          True if the size of the memory reference is known.  'MEM_SIZE
          (X)' provides its size if so.

     'MEM_SIZE (X)'
          The size in bytes of the memory reference.  This is mostly
          relevant for 'BLKmode' references as otherwise the size is
          implied by the mode.  The value is only valid if
          'MEM_SIZE_KNOWN_P (X)' is true.

     'MEM_ALIGN (X)'
          The known alignment in bits of the memory reference.

     'MEM_ADDR_SPACE (X)'
          The address space of the memory reference.  This will commonly
          be zero for the generic address space.

'REG'
     'ORIGINAL_REGNO (X)'
          This field holds the number the register "originally" had; for
          a pseudo register turned into a hard reg this will hold the
          old pseudo register number.

     'REG_EXPR (X)'
          If this register is known to hold the value of some user-level
          declaration, this is that tree node.

     'REG_OFFSET (X)'
          If this register is known to hold the value of some user-level
          declaration, this is the offset into that logical storage.

'SYMBOL_REF'
     'SYMBOL_REF_DECL (X)'
          If the 'symbol_ref' X was created for a 'VAR_DECL' or a
          'FUNCTION_DECL', that tree is recorded here.  If this value is
          null, then X was created by back end code generation routines,
          and there is no associated front end symbol table entry.

          'SYMBOL_REF_DECL' may also point to a tree of class ''c'',
          that is, some sort of constant.  In this case, the
          'symbol_ref' is an entry in the per-file constant pool; again,
          there is no associated front end symbol table entry.

     'SYMBOL_REF_CONSTANT (X)'
          If 'CONSTANT_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)' is true, this is the constant
          pool entry for X.  It is null otherwise.

     'SYMBOL_REF_DATA (X)'
          A field of opaque type used to store 'SYMBOL_REF_DECL' or
          'SYMBOL_REF_CONSTANT'.

     'SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS (X)'
          In a 'symbol_ref', this is used to communicate various
          predicates about the symbol.  Some of these are common enough
          to be computed by common code, some are specific to the
          target.  The common bits are:

          'SYMBOL_FLAG_FUNCTION'
               Set if the symbol refers to a function.

          'SYMBOL_FLAG_LOCAL'
               Set if the symbol is local to this "module".  See
               'TARGET_BINDS_LOCAL_P'.

          'SYMBOL_FLAG_EXTERNAL'
               Set if this symbol is not defined in this translation
               unit.  Note that this is not the inverse of
               'SYMBOL_FLAG_LOCAL'.

          'SYMBOL_FLAG_SMALL'
               Set if the symbol is located in the small data section.
               See 'TARGET_IN_SMALL_DATA_P'.

          'SYMBOL_REF_TLS_MODEL (X)'
               This is a multi-bit field accessor that returns the
               'tls_model' to be used for a thread-local storage symbol.
               It returns zero for non-thread-local symbols.

          'SYMBOL_FLAG_HAS_BLOCK_INFO'
               Set if the symbol has 'SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK' and
               'SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK_OFFSET' fields.

          'SYMBOL_FLAG_ANCHOR'
               Set if the symbol is used as a section anchor.  "Section
               anchors" are symbols that have a known position within an
               'object_block' and that can be used to access nearby
               members of that block.  They are used to implement
               '-fsection-anchors'.

               If this flag is set, then 'SYMBOL_FLAG_HAS_BLOCK_INFO'
               will be too.

          Bits beginning with 'SYMBOL_FLAG_MACH_DEP' are available for
          the target's use.

'SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK (X)'
     If 'SYMBOL_REF_HAS_BLOCK_INFO_P (X)', this is the 'object_block'
     structure to which the symbol belongs, or 'NULL' if it has not been
     assigned a block.

'SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK_OFFSET (X)'
     If 'SYMBOL_REF_HAS_BLOCK_INFO_P (X)', this is the offset of X from
     the first object in 'SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK (X)'.  The value is negative
     if X has not yet been assigned to a block, or it has not been given
     an offset within that block.

13.5 Flags in an RTL Expression
===============================

RTL expressions contain several flags (one-bit bit-fields) that are used
in certain types of expression.  Most often they are accessed with the
following macros, which expand into lvalues.

'CONSTANT_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a 'symbol_ref' if it refers to part of the current
     function's constant pool.  For most targets these addresses are in
     a '.rodata' section entirely separate from the function, but for
     some targets the addresses are close to the beginning of the
     function.  In either case GCC assumes these addresses can be
     addressed directly, perhaps with the help of base registers.
     Stored in the 'unchanging' field and printed as '/u'.

'RTL_CONST_CALL_P (X)'
     In a 'call_insn' indicates that the insn represents a call to a
     const function.  Stored in the 'unchanging' field and printed as
     '/u'.

'RTL_PURE_CALL_P (X)'
     In a 'call_insn' indicates that the insn represents a call to a
     pure function.  Stored in the 'return_val' field and printed as
     '/i'.

'RTL_CONST_OR_PURE_CALL_P (X)'
     In a 'call_insn', true if 'RTL_CONST_CALL_P' or 'RTL_PURE_CALL_P'
     is true.

'RTL_LOOPING_CONST_OR_PURE_CALL_P (X)'
     In a 'call_insn' indicates that the insn represents a possibly
     infinite looping call to a const or pure function.  Stored in the
     'call' field and printed as '/c'.  Only true if one of
     'RTL_CONST_CALL_P' or 'RTL_PURE_CALL_P' is true.

'INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P (X)'
     In a 'jump_insn', 'call_insn', or 'insn' indicates that the branch
     is an annulling one.  See the discussion under 'sequence' below.
     Stored in the 'unchanging' field and printed as '/u'.

'INSN_DELETED_P (X)'
     In an 'insn', 'call_insn', 'jump_insn', 'code_label',
     'jump_table_data', 'barrier', or 'note', nonzero if the insn has
     been deleted.  Stored in the 'volatil' field and printed as '/v'.

'INSN_FROM_TARGET_P (X)'
     In an 'insn' or 'jump_insn' or 'call_insn' in a delay slot of a
     branch, indicates that the insn is from the target of the branch.
     If the branch insn has 'INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' set, this insn will
     only be executed if the branch is taken.  For annulled branches
     with 'INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' clear, the insn will be executed only if
     the branch is not taken.  When 'INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is not set,
     this insn will always be executed.  Stored in the 'in_struct' field
     and printed as '/s'.

'LABEL_PRESERVE_P (X)'
     In a 'code_label' or 'note', indicates that the label is referenced
     by code or data not visible to the RTL of a given function.  Labels
     referenced by a non-local goto will have this bit set.  Stored in
     the 'in_struct' field and printed as '/s'.

'LABEL_REF_NONLOCAL_P (X)'
     In 'label_ref' and 'reg_label' expressions, nonzero if this is a
     reference to a non-local label.  Stored in the 'volatil' field and
     printed as '/v'.

'MEM_KEEP_ALIAS_SET_P (X)'
     In 'mem' expressions, 1 if we should keep the alias set for this
     mem unchanged when we access a component.  Set to 1, for example,
     when we are already in a non-addressable component of an aggregate.
     Stored in the 'jump' field and printed as '/j'.

'MEM_VOLATILE_P (X)'
     In 'mem', 'asm_operands', and 'asm_input' expressions, nonzero for
     volatile memory references.  Stored in the 'volatil' field and
     printed as '/v'.

'MEM_NOTRAP_P (X)'
     In 'mem', nonzero for memory references that will not trap.  Stored
     in the 'call' field and printed as '/c'.

'MEM_POINTER (X)'
     Nonzero in a 'mem' if the memory reference holds a pointer.  Stored
     in the 'frame_related' field and printed as '/f'.

'REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a 'reg' if it is the place in which this function's
     value is going to be returned.  (This happens only in a hard
     register.)  Stored in the 'return_val' field and printed as '/i'.

'REG_POINTER (X)'
     Nonzero in a 'reg' if the register holds a pointer.  Stored in the
     'frame_related' field and printed as '/f'.

'REG_USERVAR_P (X)'
     In a 'reg', nonzero if it corresponds to a variable present in the
     user's source code.  Zero for temporaries generated internally by
     the compiler.  Stored in the 'volatil' field and printed as '/v'.

     The same hard register may be used also for collecting the values
     of functions called by this one, but 'REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P' is zero
     in this kind of use.

'RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P (X)'
     Nonzero in an 'insn', 'call_insn', 'jump_insn', 'barrier', or 'set'
     which is part of a function prologue and sets the stack pointer,
     sets the frame pointer, or saves a register.  This flag should also
     be set on an instruction that sets up a temporary register to use
     in place of the frame pointer.  Stored in the 'frame_related' field
     and printed as '/f'.

     In particular, on RISC targets where there are limits on the sizes
     of immediate constants, it is sometimes impossible to reach the
     register save area directly from the stack pointer.  In that case,
     a temporary register is used that is near enough to the register
     save area, and the Canonical Frame Address, i.e., DWARF2's logical
     frame pointer, register must (temporarily) be changed to be this
     temporary register.  So, the instruction that sets this temporary
     register must be marked as 'RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P'.

     If the marked instruction is overly complex (defined in terms of
     what 'dwarf2out_frame_debug_expr' can handle), you will also have
     to create a 'REG_FRAME_RELATED_EXPR' note and attach it to the
     instruction.  This note should contain a simple expression of the
     computation performed by this instruction, i.e., one that
     'dwarf2out_frame_debug_expr' can handle.

     This flag is required for exception handling support on targets
     with RTL prologues.

'MEM_READONLY_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a 'mem', if the memory is statically allocated and
     read-only.

     Read-only in this context means never modified during the lifetime
     of the program, not necessarily in ROM or in write-disabled pages.
     A common example of the later is a shared library's global offset
     table.  This table is initialized by the runtime loader, so the
     memory is technically writable, but after control is transferred
     from the runtime loader to the application, this memory will never
     be subsequently modified.

     Stored in the 'unchanging' field and printed as '/u'.

'SCHED_GROUP_P (X)'
     During instruction scheduling, in an 'insn', 'call_insn',
     'jump_insn' or 'jump_table_data', indicates that the previous insn
     must be scheduled together with this insn.  This is used to ensure
     that certain groups of instructions will not be split up by the
     instruction scheduling pass, for example, 'use' insns before a
     'call_insn' may not be separated from the 'call_insn'.  Stored in
     the 'in_struct' field and printed as '/s'.

'SET_IS_RETURN_P (X)'
     For a 'set', nonzero if it is for a return.  Stored in the 'jump'
     field and printed as '/j'.

'SIBLING_CALL_P (X)'
     For a 'call_insn', nonzero if the insn is a sibling call.  Stored
     in the 'jump' field and printed as '/j'.

'STRING_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     For a 'symbol_ref' expression, nonzero if it addresses this
     function's string constant pool.  Stored in the 'frame_related'
     field and printed as '/f'.

'SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_P (X)'
     Returns a value greater then zero for a 'subreg' that has
     'SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P' nonzero if the object being referenced is
     kept zero-extended, zero if it is kept sign-extended, and less then
     zero if it is extended some other way via the 'ptr_extend'
     instruction.  Stored in the 'unchanging' field and 'volatil' field,
     printed as '/u' and '/v'.  This macro may only be used to get the
     value it may not be used to change the value.  Use
     'SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_SET' to change the value.

'SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_SET (X)'
     Set the 'unchanging' and 'volatil' fields in a 'subreg' to reflect
     zero, sign, or other extension.  If 'volatil' is zero, then
     'unchanging' as nonzero means zero extension and as zero means sign
     extension.  If 'volatil' is nonzero then some other type of
     extension was done via the 'ptr_extend' instruction.

'SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a 'subreg' if it was made when accessing an object that
     was promoted to a wider mode in accord with the 'PROMOTED_MODE'
     machine description macro (*note Storage Layout::).  In this case,
     the mode of the 'subreg' is the declared mode of the object and the
     mode of 'SUBREG_REG' is the mode of the register that holds the
     object.  Promoted variables are always either sign- or
     zero-extended to the wider mode on every assignment.  Stored in the
     'in_struct' field and printed as '/s'.

'SYMBOL_REF_USED (X)'
     In a 'symbol_ref', indicates that X has been used.  This is
     normally only used to ensure that X is only declared external once.
     Stored in the 'used' field.

'SYMBOL_REF_WEAK (X)'
     In a 'symbol_ref', indicates that X has been declared weak.  Stored
     in the 'return_val' field and printed as '/i'.

'SYMBOL_REF_FLAG (X)'
     In a 'symbol_ref', this is used as a flag for machine-specific
     purposes.  Stored in the 'volatil' field and printed as '/v'.

     Most uses of 'SYMBOL_REF_FLAG' are historic and may be subsumed by
     'SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.  Certainly use of 'SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS' is
     mandatory if the target requires more than one bit of storage.

'PREFETCH_SCHEDULE_BARRIER_P (X)'
     In a 'prefetch', indicates that the prefetch is a scheduling
     barrier.  No other INSNs will be moved over it.  Stored in the
     'volatil' field and printed as '/v'.

 These are the fields to which the above macros refer:

'call'
     In a 'mem', 1 means that the memory reference will not trap.

     In a 'call', 1 means that this pure or const call may possibly
     infinite loop.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/c'.

'frame_related'
     In an 'insn' or 'set' expression, 1 means that it is part of a
     function prologue and sets the stack pointer, sets the frame
     pointer, saves a register, or sets up a temporary register to use
     in place of the frame pointer.

     In 'reg' expressions, 1 means that the register holds a pointer.

     In 'mem' expressions, 1 means that the memory reference holds a
     pointer.

     In 'symbol_ref' expressions, 1 means that the reference addresses
     this function's string constant pool.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/f'.

'in_struct'
     In 'reg' expressions, it is 1 if the register has its entire life
     contained within the test expression of some loop.

     In 'subreg' expressions, 1 means that the 'subreg' is accessing an
     object that has had its mode promoted from a wider mode.

     In 'label_ref' expressions, 1 means that the referenced label is
     outside the innermost loop containing the insn in which the
     'label_ref' was found.

     In 'code_label' expressions, it is 1 if the label may never be
     deleted.  This is used for labels which are the target of non-local
     gotos.  Such a label that would have been deleted is replaced with
     a 'note' of type 'NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL'.

     In an 'insn' during dead-code elimination, 1 means that the insn is
     dead code.

     In an 'insn' or 'jump_insn' during reorg for an insn in the delay
     slot of a branch, 1 means that this insn is from the target of the
     branch.

     In an 'insn' during instruction scheduling, 1 means that this insn
     must be scheduled as part of a group together with the previous
     insn.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/s'.

'return_val'
     In 'reg' expressions, 1 means the register contains the value to be
     returned by the current function.  On machines that pass parameters
     in registers, the same register number may be used for parameters
     as well, but this flag is not set on such uses.

     In 'symbol_ref' expressions, 1 means the referenced symbol is weak.

     In 'call' expressions, 1 means the call is pure.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/i'.

'jump'
     In a 'mem' expression, 1 means we should keep the alias set for
     this mem unchanged when we access a component.

     In a 'set', 1 means it is for a return.

     In a 'call_insn', 1 means it is a sibling call.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/j'.

'unchanging'
     In 'reg' and 'mem' expressions, 1 means that the value of the
     expression never changes.

     In 'subreg' expressions, it is 1 if the 'subreg' references an
     unsigned object whose mode has been promoted to a wider mode.

     In an 'insn' or 'jump_insn' in the delay slot of a branch
     instruction, 1 means an annulling branch should be used.

     In a 'symbol_ref' expression, 1 means that this symbol addresses
     something in the per-function constant pool.

     In a 'call_insn' 1 means that this instruction is a call to a const
     function.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/u'.

'used'
     This flag is used directly (without an access macro) at the end of
     RTL generation for a function, to count the number of times an
     expression appears in insns.  Expressions that appear more than
     once are copied, according to the rules for shared structure (*note
     Sharing::).

     For a 'reg', it is used directly (without an access macro) by the
     leaf register renumbering code to ensure that each register is only
     renumbered once.

     In a 'symbol_ref', it indicates that an external declaration for
     the symbol has already been written.

'volatil'
     In a 'mem', 'asm_operands', or 'asm_input' expression, it is 1 if
     the memory reference is volatile.  Volatile memory references may
     not be deleted, reordered or combined.

     In a 'symbol_ref' expression, it is used for machine-specific
     purposes.

     In a 'reg' expression, it is 1 if the value is a user-level
     variable.  0 indicates an internal compiler temporary.

     In an 'insn', 1 means the insn has been deleted.

     In 'label_ref' and 'reg_label' expressions, 1 means a reference to
     a non-local label.

     In 'prefetch' expressions, 1 means that the containing insn is a
     scheduling barrier.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as '/v'.

13.6 Machine Modes
==================

A machine mode describes a size of data object and the representation
used for it.  In the C code, machine modes are represented by an
enumeration type, 'enum machine_mode', defined in 'machmode.def'.  Each
RTL expression has room for a machine mode and so do certain kinds of
tree expressions (declarations and types, to be precise).

 In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an RTL
expression is written after the expression code with a colon to separate
them.  The letters 'mode' which appear at the end of each machine mode
name are omitted.  For example, '(reg:SI 38)' is a 'reg' expression with
machine mode 'SImode'.  If the mode is 'VOIDmode', it is not written at
all.

 Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
object of 'BITS_PER_UNIT' bits (*note Storage Layout::).

'BImode'
     "Bit" mode represents a single bit, for predicate registers.

'QImode'
     "Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an
     integer.

'HImode'
     "Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.

'PSImode'
     "Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for pointers.

'SImode'
     "Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.

'PDImode'
     "Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.

'DImode'
     "Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.

'TImode'
     "Tetra Integer" (?)  mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.

'OImode'
     "Octa Integer" (?)  mode represents a thirty-two-byte integer.

'XImode'
     "Hexadeca Integer" (?)  mode represents a sixty-four-byte integer.

'QFmode'
     "Quarter-Floating" mode represents a quarter-precision (single
     byte) floating point number.

'HFmode'
     "Half-Floating" mode represents a half-precision (two byte)
     floating point number.

'TQFmode'
     "Three-Quarter-Floating" (?)  mode represents a
     three-quarter-precision (three byte) floating point number.

'SFmode'
     "Single Floating" mode represents a four byte floating point
     number.  In the common case, of a processor with IEEE arithmetic
     and 8-bit bytes, this is a single-precision IEEE floating point
     number; it can also be used for double-precision (on processors
     with 16-bit bytes) and single-precision VAX and IBM types.

'DFmode'
     "Double Floating" mode represents an eight byte floating point
     number.  In the common case, of a processor with IEEE arithmetic
     and 8-bit bytes, this is a double-precision IEEE floating point
     number.

'XFmode'
     "Extended Floating" mode represents an IEEE extended floating point
     number.  This mode only has 80 meaningful bits (ten bytes).  Some
     processors require such numbers to be padded to twelve bytes,
     others to sixteen; this mode is used for either.

'SDmode'
     "Single Decimal Floating" mode represents a four byte decimal
     floating point number (as distinct from conventional binary
     floating point).

'DDmode'
     "Double Decimal Floating" mode represents an eight byte decimal
     floating point number.

'TDmode'
     "Tetra Decimal Floating" mode represents a sixteen byte decimal
     floating point number all 128 of whose bits are meaningful.

'TFmode'
     "Tetra Floating" mode represents a sixteen byte floating point
     number all 128 of whose bits are meaningful.  One common use is the
     IEEE quad-precision format.

'QQmode'
     "Quarter-Fractional" mode represents a single byte treated as a
     signed fractional number.  The default format is "s.7".

'HQmode'
     "Half-Fractional" mode represents a two-byte signed fractional
     number.  The default format is "s.15".

'SQmode'
     "Single Fractional" mode represents a four-byte signed fractional
     number.  The default format is "s.31".

'DQmode'
     "Double Fractional" mode represents an eight-byte signed fractional
     number.  The default format is "s.63".

'TQmode'
     "Tetra Fractional" mode represents a sixteen-byte signed fractional
     number.  The default format is "s.127".

'UQQmode'
     "Unsigned Quarter-Fractional" mode represents a single byte treated
     as an unsigned fractional number.  The default format is ".8".

'UHQmode'
     "Unsigned Half-Fractional" mode represents a two-byte unsigned
     fractional number.  The default format is ".16".

'USQmode'
     "Unsigned Single Fractional" mode represents a four-byte unsigned
     fractional number.  The default format is ".32".

'UDQmode'
     "Unsigned Double Fractional" mode represents an eight-byte unsigned
     fractional number.  The default format is ".64".

'UTQmode'
     "Unsigned Tetra Fractional" mode represents a sixteen-byte unsigned
     fractional number.  The default format is ".128".

'HAmode'
     "Half-Accumulator" mode represents a two-byte signed accumulator.
     The default format is "s8.7".

'SAmode'
     "Single Accumulator" mode represents a four-byte signed
     accumulator.  The default format is "s16.15".

'DAmode'
     "Double Accumulator" mode represents an eight-byte signed
     accumulator.  The default format is "s32.31".

'TAmode'
     "Tetra Accumulator" mode represents a sixteen-byte signed
     accumulator.  The default format is "s64.63".

'UHAmode'
     "Unsigned Half-Accumulator" mode represents a two-byte unsigned
     accumulator.  The default format is "8.8".

'USAmode'
     "Unsigned Single Accumulator" mode represents a four-byte unsigned
     accumulator.  The default format is "16.16".

'UDAmode'
     "Unsigned Double Accumulator" mode represents an eight-byte
     unsigned accumulator.  The default format is "32.32".

'UTAmode'
     "Unsigned Tetra Accumulator" mode represents a sixteen-byte
     unsigned accumulator.  The default format is "64.64".

'CCmode'
     "Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code,
     which is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the
     result of a comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes may
     also be used for the condition code.  These modes are not used on
     machines that use 'cc0' (*note Condition Code::).

'BLKmode'
     "Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
     the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have
     this mode, and only if they appear in string-move or vector
     instructions.  On machines which have no such instructions,
     'BLKmode' will not appear in RTL.

'VOIDmode'
     Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.  For
     example, RTL expressions of code 'const_int' have mode 'VOIDmode'
     because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
     requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, 'VOIDmode' is expressed by
     the absence of any mode.

'QCmode, HCmode, SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     floating point values.  The floating point values are in 'QFmode',
     'HFmode', 'SFmode', 'DFmode', 'XFmode', and 'TFmode', respectively.

'CQImode, CHImode, CSImode, CDImode, CTImode, COImode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     integer values.  The integer values are in 'QImode', 'HImode',
     'SImode', 'DImode', 'TImode', and 'OImode', respectively.

 The machine description defines 'Pmode' as a C macro which expands into
the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode whose
size is 'BITS_PER_WORD', 'SImode' on 32-bit machines.

 The only modes which a machine description must support are 'QImode',
and the modes corresponding to 'BITS_PER_WORD', 'FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE' and
'DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  The compiler will attempt to use 'DImode' for
8-byte structures and unions, but this can be prevented by overriding
the definition of 'MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'.  Alternatively, you can have
the compiler use 'TImode' for 16-byte structures and unions.  Likewise,
you can arrange for the C type 'short int' to avoid using 'HImode'.

 Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler
and these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine
modes are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the
enumeration type 'enum mode_class' defined in 'machmode.h'.  The
possible mode classes are:

'MODE_INT'
     Integer modes.  By default these are 'BImode', 'QImode', 'HImode',
     'SImode', 'DImode', 'TImode', and 'OImode'.

'MODE_PARTIAL_INT'
     The "partial integer" modes, 'PQImode', 'PHImode', 'PSImode' and
     'PDImode'.

'MODE_FLOAT'
     Floating point modes.  By default these are 'QFmode', 'HFmode',
     'TQFmode', 'SFmode', 'DFmode', 'XFmode' and 'TFmode'.

'MODE_DECIMAL_FLOAT'
     Decimal floating point modes.  By default these are 'SDmode',
     'DDmode' and 'TDmode'.

'MODE_FRACT'
     Signed fractional modes.  By default these are 'QQmode', 'HQmode',
     'SQmode', 'DQmode' and 'TQmode'.

'MODE_UFRACT'
     Unsigned fractional modes.  By default these are 'UQQmode',
     'UHQmode', 'USQmode', 'UDQmode' and 'UTQmode'.

'MODE_ACCUM'
     Signed accumulator modes.  By default these are 'HAmode', 'SAmode',
     'DAmode' and 'TAmode'.

'MODE_UACCUM'
     Unsigned accumulator modes.  By default these are 'UHAmode',
     'USAmode', 'UDAmode' and 'UTAmode'.

'MODE_COMPLEX_INT'
     Complex integer modes.  (These are not currently implemented).

'MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT'
     Complex floating point modes.  By default these are 'QCmode',
     'HCmode', 'SCmode', 'DCmode', 'XCmode', and 'TCmode'.

'MODE_FUNCTION'
     Algol or Pascal function variables including a static chain.
     (These are not currently implemented).

'MODE_CC'
     Modes representing condition code values.  These are 'CCmode' plus
     any 'CC_MODE' modes listed in the 'MACHINE-modes.def'.  *Note Jump
     Patterns::, also see *note Condition Code::.

'MODE_RANDOM'
     This is a catchall mode class for modes which don't fit into the
     above classes.  Currently 'VOIDmode' and 'BLKmode' are in
     'MODE_RANDOM'.

 Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:

'GET_MODE (X)'
     Returns the machine mode of the RTX X.

'PUT_MODE (X, NEWMODE)'
     Alters the machine mode of the RTX X to be NEWMODE.

'NUM_MACHINE_MODES'
     Stands for the number of machine modes available on the target
     machine.  This is one greater than the largest numeric value of any
     machine mode.

'GET_MODE_NAME (M)'
     Returns the name of mode M as a string.

'GET_MODE_CLASS (M)'
     Returns the mode class of mode M.

'GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (M)'
     Returns the next wider natural mode.  For example, the expression
     'GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (QImode)' returns 'HImode'.

'GET_MODE_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode M.

'GET_MODE_BITSIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode M.

'GET_MODE_IBIT (M)'
     Returns the number of integral bits of a datum of fixed-point mode
     M.

'GET_MODE_FBIT (M)'
     Returns the number of fractional bits of a datum of fixed-point
     mode M.

'GET_MODE_MASK (M)'
     Returns a bitmask containing 1 for all bits in a word that fit
     within mode M.  This macro can only be used for modes whose bitsize
     is less than or equal to 'HOST_BITS_PER_INT'.

'GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (M)'
     Return the required alignment, in bits, for an object of mode M.

'GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of the subunits of a datum of mode M.
     This is the same as 'GET_MODE_SIZE' except in the case of complex
     modes.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or
     imaginary part.

'GET_MODE_NUNITS (M)'
     Returns the number of units contained in a mode, i.e.,
     'GET_MODE_SIZE' divided by 'GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE'.

'GET_CLASS_NARROWEST_MODE (C)'
     Returns the narrowest mode in mode class C.

 The following 3 variables are defined on every target.  They can be
used to allocate buffers that are guaranteed to be large enough to hold
any value that can be represented on the target.  The first two can be
overridden by defining them in the target's mode.def file, however, the
value must be a constant that can determined very early in the
compilation process.  The third symbol cannot be overridden.

'BITS_PER_UNIT'
     The number of bits in an addressable storage unit (byte).  If you
     do not define this, the default is 8.

'MAX_BITSIZE_MODE_ANY_INT'
     The maximum bitsize of any mode that is used in integer math.  This
     should be overridden by the target if it uses large integers as
     containers for larger vectors but otherwise never uses the contents
     to compute integer values.

'MAX_BITSIZE_MODE_ANY_MODE'
     The bitsize of the largest mode on the target.

 The global variables 'byte_mode' and 'word_mode' contain modes whose
classes are 'MODE_INT' and whose bitsizes are either 'BITS_PER_UNIT' or
'BITS_PER_WORD', respectively.  On 32-bit machines, these are 'QImode'
and 'SImode', respectively.

13.7 Constant Expression Types
==============================

The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant values.

'(const_int I)'
     This type of expression represents the integer value I.  I is
     customarily accessed with the macro 'INTVAL' as in 'INTVAL (EXP)',
     which is equivalent to 'XWINT (EXP, 0)'.

     Constants generated for modes with fewer bits than in
     'HOST_WIDE_INT' must be sign extended to full width (e.g., with
     'gen_int_mode').  For constants for modes with more bits than in
     'HOST_WIDE_INT' the implied high order bits of that constant are
     copies of the top bit.  Note however that values are neither
     inherently signed nor inherently unsigned; where necessary,
     signedness is determined by the rtl operation instead.

     There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it
     is the value of the variable 'const0_rtx'.  Likewise, the only
     expression for integer value one is found in 'const1_rtx', the only
     expression for integer value two is found in 'const2_rtx', and the
     only expression for integer value negative one is found in
     'constm1_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
     'const_int' and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
     'const0_rtx', 'const1_rtx', 'const2_rtx' or 'constm1_rtx' as
     appropriate.

     Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
     'STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is found in 'const_true_rtx'.  If
     'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is one, 'const_true_rtx' and 'const1_rtx' will
     point to the same object.  If 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is -1,
     'const_true_rtx' and 'constm1_rtx' will point to the same object.

'(const_double:M I0 I1 ...)'
     Represents either a floating-point constant of mode M or an integer
     constant too large to fit into 'HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT' bits but
     small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GCC does not
     provide a mechanism to represent even larger constants).  In the
     latter case, M will be 'VOIDmode'.  For integral values constants
     for modes with more bits than twice the number in 'HOST_WIDE_INT'
     the implied high order bits of that constant are copies of the top
     bit of 'CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH'.  Note however that integral values are
     neither inherently signed nor inherently unsigned; where necessary,
     signedness is determined by the rtl operation instead.

     If M is 'VOIDmode', the bits of the value are stored in I0 and I1.
     I0 is customarily accessed with the macro 'CONST_DOUBLE_LOW' and I1
     with 'CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH'.

     If the constant is floating point (regardless of its precision),
     then the number of integers used to store the value depends on the
     size of 'REAL_VALUE_TYPE' (*note Floating Point::).  The integers
     represent a floating point number, but not precisely in the target
     machine's or host machine's floating point format.  To convert them
     to the precise bit pattern used by the target machine, use the
     macro 'REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' and friends (*note Data
     Output::).

'(const_fixed:M ...)'
     Represents a fixed-point constant of mode M.  The operand is a data
     structure of type 'struct fixed_value' and is accessed with the
     macro 'CONST_FIXED_VALUE'.  The high part of data is accessed with
     'CONST_FIXED_VALUE_HIGH'; the low part is accessed with
     'CONST_FIXED_VALUE_LOW'.

'(const_vector:M [X0 X1 ...])'
     Represents a vector constant.  The square brackets stand for the
     vector containing the constant elements.  X0, X1 and so on are the
     'const_int', 'const_double' or 'const_fixed' elements.

     The number of units in a 'const_vector' is obtained with the macro
     'CONST_VECTOR_NUNITS' as in 'CONST_VECTOR_NUNITS (V)'.

     Individual elements in a vector constant are accessed with the
     macro 'CONST_VECTOR_ELT' as in 'CONST_VECTOR_ELT (V, N)' where V is
     the vector constant and N is the element desired.

'(const_string STR)'
     Represents a constant string with value STR.  Currently this is
     used only for insn attributes (*note Insn Attributes::) since
     constant strings in C are placed in memory.

'(symbol_ref:MODE SYMBOL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  SYMBOL is a
     string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it
     starts with a '*', the label is the rest of SYMBOL not including
     the '*'.  Otherwise, the label is SYMBOL, usually prefixed with
     '_'.

     The 'symbol_ref' contains a mode, which is usually 'Pmode'.
     Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.

'(label_ref:MODE LABEL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains
     one operand, an expression, which must be a 'code_label' or a
     'note' of type 'NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL' that appears in the
     instruction sequence to identify the place where the label should
     go.

     The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
     references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.

     The 'label_ref' contains a mode, which is usually 'Pmode'.  Usually
     that is the only mode for which a label is directly valid.

'(const:M EXP)'
     Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
     arithmetic computation.  The operand, EXP, is an expression that
     contains only constants ('const_int', 'symbol_ref' and 'label_ref'
     expressions) combined with 'plus' and 'minus'.  However, not all
     combinations are valid, since the assembler cannot do arbitrary
     arithmetic on relocatable symbols.

     M should be 'Pmode'.

'(high:M EXP)'
     Represents the high-order bits of EXP, usually a 'symbol_ref'.  The
     number of bits is machine-dependent and is normally the number of
     bits specified in an instruction that initializes the high order
     bits of a register.  It is used with 'lo_sum' to represent the
     typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to reference
     a global memory location.

     M should be 'Pmode'.

 The macro 'CONST0_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 0 in
mode MODE.  If mode MODE is of mode class 'MODE_INT', it returns
'const0_rtx'.  If mode MODE is of mode class 'MODE_FLOAT', it returns a
'CONST_DOUBLE' expression in mode MODE.  Otherwise, it returns a
'CONST_VECTOR' expression in mode MODE.  Similarly, the macro
'CONST1_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 1 in mode MODE
and similarly for 'CONST2_RTX'.  The 'CONST1_RTX' and 'CONST2_RTX'
macros are undefined for vector modes.

13.8 Registers and Memory
=========================

Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.

'(reg:M N)'
     For small values of the integer N (those that are less than
     'FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'), this stands for a reference to machine
     register number N: a "hard register".  For larger values of N, it
     stands for a temporary value or "pseudo register".  The compiler's
     strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited number of such
     pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard registers or
     into memory references.

     M is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
     machines can generally refer to each register in more than one
     mode.  For example, a register may contain a full word but there
     may be instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single
     byte, as well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point
     number of various precisions.

     Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
     the mode must always be specified.

     The symbol 'FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER' is defined by the machine
     description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is
     an invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that
     not all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All
     the machine registers that can be used for storage of data are
     given hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in
     certain instructions or can hold only certain types of data.

     A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
     function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode and is
     accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe an
     access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a 'subreg'
     expression is used.

     A 'reg' expression with a machine mode that specifies more than one
     word of data may actually stand for several consecutive registers.
     If in addition the register number specifies a hardware register,
     then it actually represents several consecutive hardware registers
     starting with the specified one.

     Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
     represented by a unique 'reg' expression.

     Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
     'FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' to 'LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' only appear
     during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
     optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame
     that cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function has
     been completed.  The following virtual register numbers are
     defined:

     'VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the first word of the incoming arguments passed
          on the stack.  Normally these arguments are placed there by
          the caller, but the callee may have pushed some arguments that
          were previously passed in registers.

          When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is
          replaced by the sum of the register given by
          'ARG_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value of 'FIRST_PARM_OFFSET'.

     'VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM'
          If 'FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined to a nonzero value, this
          points to immediately above the first variable on the stack.
          Otherwise, it points to the first variable on the stack.

          'VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM' is replaced with the sum of the
          register given by 'FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          'STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

     'VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM'
          This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory on
          the stack immediately after the stack pointer has been
          adjusted by the amount of memory desired.

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by 'STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          'STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET'.

     'VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing
          arguments should be written when the stack is pre-pushed
          (arguments pushed using push insns should always use
          'STACK_POINTER_REGNUM').

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by 'STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          'STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'.

'(subreg:M1 REG:M2 BYTENUM)'

     'subreg' expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
     mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of a
     multi-part 'reg' that actually refers to several registers.

     Each pseudo register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
     operate on it in a different mode, the register must be enclosed in
     a 'subreg'.

     There are currently three supported types for the first operand of
     a 'subreg':
        * pseudo registers This is the most common case.  Most 'subreg's
          have pseudo 'reg's as their first operand.

        * mem 'subreg's of 'mem' were common in earlier versions of GCC
          and are still supported.  During the reload pass these are
          replaced by plain 'mem's.  On machines that do not do
          instruction scheduling, use of 'subreg's of 'mem' are still
          used, but this is no longer recommended.  Such 'subreg's are
          considered to be 'register_operand's rather than
          'memory_operand's before and during reload.  Because of this,
          the scheduling passes cannot properly schedule instructions
          with 'subreg's of 'mem', so for machines that do scheduling,
          'subreg's of 'mem' should never be used.  To support this, the
          combine and recog passes have explicit code to inhibit the
          creation of 'subreg's of 'mem' when 'INSN_SCHEDULING' is
          defined.

          The use of 'subreg's of 'mem' after the reload pass is an area
          that is not well understood and should be avoided.  There is
          still some code in the compiler to support this, but this code
          has possibly rotted.  This use of 'subreg's is discouraged and
          will most likely not be supported in the future.

        * hard registers It is seldom necessary to wrap hard registers
          in 'subreg's; such registers would normally reduce to a single
          'reg' rtx.  This use of 'subreg's is discouraged and may not
          be supported in the future.

     'subreg's of 'subreg's are not supported.  Using
     'simplify_gen_subreg' is the recommended way to avoid this problem.

     'subreg's come in two distinct flavors, each having its own usage
     and rules:

     Paradoxical subregs
          When M1 is strictly wider than M2, the 'subreg' expression is
          called "paradoxical".  The canonical test for this class of
          'subreg' is:

               GET_MODE_SIZE (M1) > GET_MODE_SIZE (M2)

          Paradoxical 'subreg's can be used as both lvalues and rvalues.
          When used as an lvalue, the low-order bits of the source value
          are stored in REG and the high-order bits are discarded.  When
          used as an rvalue, the low-order bits of the 'subreg' are
          taken from REG while the high-order bits may or may not be
          defined.

          The high-order bits of rvalues are in the following
          circumstances:

             * 'subreg's of 'mem' When M2 is smaller than a word, the
               macro 'LOAD_EXTEND_OP', can control how the high-order
               bits are defined.

             * 'subreg' of 'reg's The upper bits are defined when
               'SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P' is true.
               'SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_P' describes what the upper
               bits hold.  Such subregs usually represent local
               variables, register variables and parameter pseudo
               variables that have been promoted to a wider mode.

          BYTENUM is always zero for a paradoxical 'subreg', even on
          big-endian targets.

          For example, the paradoxical 'subreg':

               (set (subreg:SI (reg:HI X) 0) Y)

          stores the lower 2 bytes of Y in X and discards the upper 2
          bytes.  A subsequent:

               (set Z (subreg:SI (reg:HI X) 0))

          would set the lower two bytes of Z to Y and set the upper two
          bytes to an unknown value assuming 'SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P' is
          false.

     Normal subregs
          When M1 is at least as narrow as M2 the 'subreg' expression is
          called "normal".

          Normal 'subreg's restrict consideration to certain bits of
          REG.  There are two cases.  If M1 is smaller than a word, the
          'subreg' refers to the least-significant part (or "lowpart")
          of one word of REG.  If M1 is word-sized or greater, the
          'subreg' refers to one or more complete words.

          When used as an lvalue, 'subreg' is a word-based accessor.
          Storing to a 'subreg' modifies all the words of REG that
          overlap the 'subreg', but it leaves the other words of REG
          alone.

          When storing to a normal 'subreg' that is smaller than a word,
          the other bits of the referenced word are usually left in an
          undefined state.  This laxity makes it easier to generate
          efficient code for such instructions.  To represent an
          instruction that preserves all the bits outside of those in
          the 'subreg', use 'strict_low_part' or 'zero_extract' around
          the 'subreg'.

          BYTENUM must identify the offset of the first byte of the
          'subreg' from the start of REG, assuming that REG is laid out
          in memory order.  The memory order of bytes is defined by two
          target macros, 'WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' and 'BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN':

             * 'WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says that byte number
               zero is part of the most significant word; otherwise, it
               is part of the least significant word.

             * 'BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says that byte number
               zero is the most significant byte within a word;
               otherwise, it is the least significant byte within a
               word.

          On a few targets, 'FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' disagrees with
          'WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.  However, most parts of the compiler treat
          floating point values as if they had the same endianness as
          integer values.  This works because they handle them solely as
          a collection of integer values, with no particular numerical
          value.  Only real.c and the runtime libraries care about
          'FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'.

          Thus,

               (subreg:HI (reg:SI X) 2)

          on a 'BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN', 'UNITS_PER_WORD == 4' target is the
          same as

               (subreg:HI (reg:SI X) 0)

          on a little-endian, 'UNITS_PER_WORD == 4' target.  Both
          'subreg's access the lower two bytes of register X.

     A 'MODE_PARTIAL_INT' mode behaves as if it were as wide as the
     corresponding 'MODE_INT' mode, except that it has an unknown number
     of undefined bits.  For example:

          (subreg:PSI (reg:SI 0) 0)

     accesses the whole of '(reg:SI 0)', but the exact relationship
     between the 'PSImode' value and the 'SImode' value is not defined.
     If we assume 'UNITS_PER_WORD <= 4', then the following two
     'subreg's:

          (subreg:PSI (reg:DI 0) 0)
          (subreg:PSI (reg:DI 0) 4)

     represent independent 4-byte accesses to the two halves of '(reg:DI
     0)'.  Both 'subreg's have an unknown number of undefined bits.

     If 'UNITS_PER_WORD <= 2' then these two 'subreg's:

          (subreg:HI (reg:PSI 0) 0)
          (subreg:HI (reg:PSI 0) 2)

     represent independent 2-byte accesses that together span the whole
     of '(reg:PSI 0)'.  Storing to the first 'subreg' does not affect
     the value of the second, and vice versa.  '(reg:PSI 0)' has an
     unknown number of undefined bits, so the assignment:

          (set (subreg:HI (reg:PSI 0) 0) (reg:HI 4))

     does not guarantee that '(subreg:HI (reg:PSI 0) 0)' has the value
     '(reg:HI 4)'.

     The rules above apply to both pseudo REGs and hard REGs.  If the
     semantics are not correct for particular combinations of M1, M2 and
     hard REG, the target-specific code must ensure that those
     combinations are never used.  For example:

          CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS (M2, M1, CLASS)

     must be true for every class CLASS that includes REG.

     The first operand of a 'subreg' expression is customarily accessed
     with the 'SUBREG_REG' macro and the second operand is customarily
     accessed with the 'SUBREG_BYTE' macro.

     It has been several years since a platform in which
     'BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN' not equal to 'WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' has been tested.
     Anyone wishing to support such a platform in the future may be
     confronted with code rot.

'(scratch:M)'
     This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
     execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
     converted into a 'reg' by either the local register allocator or
     the reload pass.

     'scratch' is usually present inside a 'clobber' operation (*note
     Side Effects::).

'(cc0)'
     This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
     operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to
     use it:

        * To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is
          best on most machines, where each comparison sets the entire
          series of flags.

          With this technique, '(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) and in comparison operators comparing
          against zero ('const_int' with value zero; that is to say,
          'const0_rtx').

        * To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single
          condition.  This is useful on machines that have only a single
          flag bit, and in which comparison instructions must specify
          the condition to test.

          With this technique, '(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) where the source is a comparison
          operator, and as the first operand of 'if_then_else' (in a
          conditional branch).

     There is only one expression object of code 'cc0'; it is the value
     of the variable 'cc0_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code 'cc0' will return 'cc0_rtx'.

     Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many
     machines, nearly all instructions set the condition code based on
     the value that they compute or store.  It is not necessary to
     record these actions explicitly in the RTL because the machine
     description includes a prescription for recognizing the
     instructions that do so (by means of the macro 'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC').
     *Note Condition Code::.  Only instructions whose sole purpose is to
     set the condition code, and instructions that use the condition
     code, need mention '(cc0)'.

     On some machines, the condition code register is given a register
     number and a 'reg' is used instead of '(cc0)'.  This is usually the
     preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify
     the condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in
     general registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.

     Some machines, such as the SPARC and RS/6000, have two sets of
     arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set
     the condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating
     the instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a
     pattern that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition
     code register (which would not be '(cc0)' in this case).  For
     examples, search for 'addcc' and 'andcc' in 'sparc.md'.

'(pc)'
     This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands
     and may not have a machine mode.  '(pc)' may be validly used only
     in certain specific contexts in jump instructions.

     There is only one expression object of code 'pc'; it is the value
     of the variable 'pc_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code 'pc' will return 'pc_rtx'.

     All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter
     implicitly by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention this
     in the RTL.

'(mem:M ADDR ALIAS)'
     This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
     represented by the expression ADDR.  M specifies how large a unit
     of memory is accessed.  ALIAS specifies an alias set for the
     reference.  In general two items are in different alias sets if
     they cannot reference the same memory address.

     The construct '(mem:BLK (scratch))' is considered to alias all
     other memories.  Thus it may be used as a memory barrier in
     epilogue stack deallocation patterns.

'(concatM RTX RTX)'
     This RTX represents the concatenation of two other RTXs.  This is
     used for complex values.  It should only appear in the RTL attached
     to declarations and during RTL generation.  It should not appear in
     the ordinary insn chain.

'(concatnM [RTX ...])'
     This RTX represents the concatenation of all the RTX to make a
     single value.  Like 'concat', this should only appear in
     declarations, and not in the insn chain.

13.9 RTL Expressions for Arithmetic
===================================

Unless otherwise specified, all the operands of arithmetic expressions
must be valid for mode M.  An operand is valid for mode M if it has mode
M, or if it is a 'const_int' or 'const_double' and M is a mode of class
'MODE_INT'.

 For commutative binary operations, constants should be placed in the
second operand.

'(plus:M X Y)'
'(ss_plus:M X Y)'
'(us_plus:M X Y)'

     These three expressions all represent the sum of the values
     represented by X and Y carried out in machine mode M.  They differ
     in their behavior on overflow of integer modes.  'plus' wraps round
     modulo the width of M; 'ss_plus' saturates at the maximum signed
     value representable in M; 'us_plus' saturates at the maximum
     unsigned value.

'(lo_sum:M X Y)'

     This expression represents the sum of X and the low-order bits of
     Y.  It is used with 'high' (*note Constants::) to represent the
     typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to reference
     a global memory location.

     The number of low order bits is machine-dependent but is normally
     the number of bits in a 'Pmode' item minus the number of bits set
     by 'high'.

     M should be 'Pmode'.

'(minus:M X Y)'
'(ss_minus:M X Y)'
'(us_minus:M X Y)'

     These three expressions represent the result of subtracting Y from
     X, carried out in mode M.  Behavior on overflow is the same as for
     the three variants of 'plus' (see above).

'(compare:M X Y)'
     Represents the result of subtracting Y from X for purposes of
     comparison.  The result is computed without overflow, as if with
     infinite precision.

     Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision.
     However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the result
     will be used, which is the case when the result is stored in the
     condition code.  And that is the _only_ way this kind of expression
     may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the condition
     codes, either '(cc0)' or a register.  *Note Comparisons::.

     The mode M is not related to the modes of X and Y, but instead is
     the mode of the condition code value.  If '(cc0)' is used, it is
     'VOIDmode'.  Otherwise it is some mode in class 'MODE_CC', often
     'CCmode'.  *Note Condition Code::.  If M is 'VOIDmode' or 'CCmode',
     the operation returns sufficient information (in an unspecified
     format) so that any comparison operator can be applied to the
     result of the 'COMPARE' operation.  For other modes in class
     'MODE_CC', the operation only returns a subset of this information.

     Normally, X and Y must have the same mode.  Otherwise, 'compare' is
     valid only if the mode of X is in class 'MODE_INT' and Y is a
     'const_int' or 'const_double' with mode 'VOIDmode'.  The mode of X
     determines what mode the comparison is to be done in; thus it must
     not be 'VOIDmode'.

     If one of the operands is a constant, it should be placed in the
     second operand and the comparison code adjusted as appropriate.

     A 'compare' specifying two 'VOIDmode' constants is not valid since
     there is no way to know in what mode the comparison is to be
     performed; the comparison must either be folded during the
     compilation or the first operand must be loaded into a register
     while its mode is still known.

'(neg:M X)'
'(ss_neg:M X)'
'(us_neg:M X)'
     These two expressions represent the negation (subtraction from
     zero) of the value represented by X, carried out in mode M.  They
     differ in the behavior on overflow of integer modes.  In the case
     of 'neg', the negation of the operand may be a number not
     representable in mode M, in which case it is truncated to M.
     'ss_neg' and 'us_neg' ensure that an out-of-bounds result saturates
     to the maximum or minimum signed or unsigned value.

'(mult:M X Y)'
'(ss_mult:M X Y)'
'(us_mult:M X Y)'
     Represents the signed product of the values represented by X and Y
     carried out in machine mode M.  'ss_mult' and 'us_mult' ensure that
     an out-of-bounds result saturates to the maximum or minimum signed
     or unsigned value.

     Some machines support a multiplication that generates a product
     wider than the operands.  Write the pattern for this as

          (mult:M (sign_extend:M X) (sign_extend:M Y))

     where M is wider than the modes of X and Y, which need not be the
     same.

     For unsigned widening multiplication, use the same idiom, but with
     'zero_extend' instead of 'sign_extend'.

'(fma:M X Y Z)'
     Represents the 'fma', 'fmaf', and 'fmal' builtin functions that do
     a combined multiply of X and Y and then adding toZ without doing an
     intermediate rounding step.

'(div:M X Y)'
'(ss_div:M X Y)'
     Represents the quotient in signed division of X by Y, carried out
     in machine mode M.  If M is a floating point mode, it represents
     the exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized quotient.  'ss_div'
     ensures that an out-of-bounds result saturates to the maximum or
     minimum signed value.

     Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
     quotient widths are not all the same; you should represent such
     instructions using 'truncate' and 'sign_extend' as in,

          (truncate:M1 (div:M2 X (sign_extend:M2 Y)))

'(udiv:M X Y)'
'(us_div:M X Y)'
     Like 'div' but represents unsigned division.  'us_div' ensures that
     an out-of-bounds result saturates to the maximum or minimum
     unsigned value.

'(mod:M X Y)'
'(umod:M X Y)'
     Like 'div' and 'udiv' but represent the remainder instead of the
     quotient.

'(smin:M X Y)'
'(smax:M X Y)'
     Represents the smaller (for 'smin') or larger (for 'smax') of X and
     Y, interpreted as signed values in mode M.  When used with floating
     point, if both operands are zeros, or if either operand is 'NaN',
     then it is unspecified which of the two operands is returned as the
     result.

'(umin:M X Y)'
'(umax:M X Y)'
     Like 'smin' and 'smax', but the values are interpreted as unsigned
     integers.

'(not:M X)'
     Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by X,
     carried out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.

'(and:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     machine mode.

'(ior:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

'(xor:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

'(ashift:M X C)'
'(ss_ashift:M X C)'
'(us_ashift:M X C)'
     These three expressions represent the result of arithmetically
     shifting X left by C places.  They differ in their behavior on
     overflow of integer modes.  An 'ashift' operation is a plain shift
     with no special behavior in case of a change in the sign bit;
     'ss_ashift' and 'us_ashift' saturates to the minimum or maximum
     representable value if any of the bits shifted out differs from the
     final sign bit.

     X have mode M, a fixed-point machine mode.  C be a fixed-point mode
     or be a constant with mode 'VOIDmode'; which mode is determined by
     the mode called for in the machine description entry for the
     left-shift instruction.  For example, on the VAX, the mode of C is
     'QImode' regardless of M.

'(lshiftrt:M X C)'
'(ashiftrt:M X C)'
     Like 'ashift' but for right shift.  Unlike the case for left shift,
     these two operations are distinct.

'(rotate:M X C)'
'(rotatert:M X C)'
     Similar but represent left and right rotate.  If C is a constant,
     use 'rotate'.

'(abs:M X)'
'(ss_abs:M X)'
     Represents the absolute value of X, computed in mode M.  'ss_abs'
     ensures that an out-of-bounds result saturates to the maximum
     signed value.

'(sqrt:M X)'
     Represents the square root of X, computed in mode M.  Most often M
     will be a floating point mode.

'(ffs:M X)'
     Represents one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in X,
     represented as an integer of mode M.  (The value is zero if X is
     zero.)  The mode of X must be M or 'VOIDmode'.

'(clrsb:M X)'
     Represents the number of redundant leading sign bits in X,
     represented as an integer of mode M, starting at the most
     significant bit position.  This is one less than the number of
     leading sign bits (either 0 or 1), with no special cases.  The mode
     of X must be M or 'VOIDmode'.

'(clz:M X)'
     Represents the number of leading 0-bits in X, represented as an
     integer of mode M, starting at the most significant bit position.
     If X is zero, the value is determined by
     'CLZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO' (*note Misc::).  Note that this is one
     of the few expressions that is not invariant under widening.  The
     mode of X must be M or 'VOIDmode'.

'(ctz:M X)'
     Represents the number of trailing 0-bits in X, represented as an
     integer of mode M, starting at the least significant bit position.
     If X is zero, the value is determined by
     'CTZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO' (*note Misc::).  Except for this case,
     'ctz(x)' is equivalent to 'ffs(X) - 1'.  The mode of X must be M or
     'VOIDmode'.

'(popcount:M X)'
     Represents the number of 1-bits in X, represented as an integer of
     mode M.  The mode of X must be M or 'VOIDmode'.

'(parity:M X)'
     Represents the number of 1-bits modulo 2 in X, represented as an
     integer of mode M.  The mode of X must be M or 'VOIDmode'.

'(bswap:M X)'
     Represents the value X with the order of bytes reversed, carried
     out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.  The mode
     of X must be M or 'VOIDmode'.

13.10 Comparison Operations
===========================

Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are considered
to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by, but not
necessarily equal to, 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::) if the relation
holds, or zero if it does not, for comparison operators whose results
have a 'MODE_INT' mode, 'FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::) if the
relation holds, or zero if it does not, for comparison operators that
return floating-point values, and a vector of either
'VECTOR_STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::) if the relation holds, or of
zeros if it does not, for comparison operators that return vector
results.  The mode of the comparison operation is independent of the
mode of the data being compared.  If the comparison operation is being
tested (e.g., the first operand of an 'if_then_else'), the mode must be
'VOIDmode'.

 There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes '(cc0)'
against zero, as in '(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))'.  Such a construct
actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction in which the
condition codes were set.  The instruction setting the condition code
must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition code; only
'note' insns may separate them.

 Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
constant folding.

 In the example above, if '(cc0)' were last set to '(compare X Y)', the
comparison operation is identical to '(eq X Y)'.  Usually only one style
of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the combine
pass will try to merge the operations to produce the 'eq' shown in case
it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.

 Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.  Thus,
there are distinct expression codes 'gt' and 'gtu' for signed and
unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
'0xffffffff' which is greater than 1.

 The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.
Floating point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of the
operands.

'(eq:M X Y)'
     'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the values represented by X and Y are equal,
     otherwise 0.

'(ne:M X Y)'
     'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the values represented by X and Y are not
     equal, otherwise 0.

'(gt:M X Y)'
     'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the X is greater than Y.  If they are
     fixed-point, the comparison is done in a signed sense.

'(gtu:M X Y)'
     Like 'gt' but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers
     only.

'(lt:M X Y)'
'(ltu:M X Y)'
     Like 'gt' and 'gtu' but test for "less than".

'(ge:M X Y)'
'(geu:M X Y)'
     Like 'gt' and 'gtu' but test for "greater than or equal".

'(le:M X Y)'
'(leu:M X Y)'
     Like 'gt' and 'gtu' but test for "less than or equal".

'(if_then_else COND THEN ELSE)'
     This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
     always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
     precise, COND is a comparison expression.  This expression
     represents a choice, according to COND, between the value
     represented by THEN and the one represented by ELSE.

     On most machines, 'if_then_else' expressions are valid only to
     express conditional jumps.

'(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 TEST2 VALUE2 ...] DEFAULT)'
     Similar to 'if_then_else', but more general.  Each of TEST1, TEST2,
     ... is performed in turn.  The result of this expression is the
     VALUE corresponding to the first nonzero test, or DEFAULT if none
     of the tests are nonzero expressions.

     This is currently not valid for instruction patterns and is
     supported only for insn attributes.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

13.11 Bit-Fields
================

Special expression codes exist to represent bit-field instructions.

'(sign_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit-field contained
     or starting in LOC (a memory or register reference).  The bit-field
     is SIZE bits wide and starts at bit POS.  The compilation option
     'BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' says which end of the memory unit POS counts
     from.

     If LOC is in memory, its mode must be a single-byte integer mode.
     If LOC is in a register, the mode to use is specified by the
     operand of the 'insv' or 'extv' pattern (*note Standard Names::)
     and is usually a full-word integer mode, which is the default if
     none is specified.

     The mode of POS is machine-specific and is also specified in the
     'insv' or 'extv' pattern.

     The mode M is the same as the mode that would be used for LOC if it
     were a register.

     A 'sign_extract' can not appear as an lvalue, or part thereof, in
     RTL.

'(zero_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     Like 'sign_extract' but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended
     bit-field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they are
     filled to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.

     Unlike 'sign_extract', this type of expressions can be lvalues in
     RTL; they may appear on the left side of an assignment, indicating
     insertion of a value into the specified bit-field.

13.12 Vector Operations
=======================

All normal RTL expressions can be used with vector modes; they are
interpreted as operating on each part of the vector independently.
Additionally, there are a few new expressions to describe specific
vector operations.

'(vec_merge:M VEC1 VEC2 ITEMS)'
     This describes a merge operation between two vectors.  The result
     is a vector of mode M; its elements are selected from either VEC1
     or VEC2.  Which elements are selected is described by ITEMS, which
     is a bit mask represented by a 'const_int'; a zero bit indicates
     the corresponding element in the result vector is taken from VEC2
     while a set bit indicates it is taken from VEC1.

'(vec_select:M VEC1 SELECTION)'
     This describes an operation that selects parts of a vector.  VEC1
     is the source vector, and SELECTION is a 'parallel' that contains a
     'const_int' for each of the subparts of the result vector, giving
     the number of the source subpart that should be stored into it.
     The result mode M is either the submode for a single element of
     VEC1 (if only one subpart is selected), or another vector mode with
     that element submode (if multiple subparts are selected).

'(vec_concat:M X1 X2)'
     Describes a vector concat operation.  The result is a concatenation
     of the vectors or scalars X1 and X2; its length is the sum of the
     lengths of the two inputs.

'(vec_duplicate:M X)'
     This operation converts a scalar into a vector or a small vector
     into a larger one by duplicating the input values.  The output
     vector mode must have the same submodes as the input vector mode or
     the scalar modes, and the number of output parts must be an integer
     multiple of the number of input parts.

13.13 Conversions
=================

All conversions between machine modes must be represented by explicit
conversion operations.  For example, an expression which is the sum of a
byte and a full word cannot be written as '(plus:SI (reg:QI 34) (reg:SI
80))' because the 'plus' operation requires two operands of the same
machine mode.  Therefore, the byte-sized operand is enclosed in a
conversion operation, as in

     (plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))

 The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there may
be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode to the
desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how to do it.

 For all conversion operations, X must not be 'VOIDmode' because the
mode in which to do the conversion would not be known.  The conversion
must either be done at compile-time or X must be placed into a register.

'(sign_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of sign-extending the value X to machine mode
     M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a
     mode narrower than M.

'(zero_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of zero-extending the value X to machine mode
     M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a
     mode narrower than M.

'(float_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of extending the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode narrower than M.

'(truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
     wider than M.

'(ss_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M,
     using signed saturation in the case of overflow.  Both M and the
     mode of X must be fixed-point modes.

'(us_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M,
     using unsigned saturation in the case of overflow.  Both M and the
     mode of X must be fixed-point modes.

'(float_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode wider than M.

'(float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as signed, to floating point mode M.

'(unsigned_float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as unsigned, to floating point mode M.

'(fix:M X)'
     When M is a floating-point mode, represents the result of
     converting floating point value X (valid for mode M) to an integer,
     still represented in floating point mode M, by rounding towards
     zero.

     When M is a fixed-point mode, represents the result of converting
     floating point value X to mode M, regarded as signed.  How rounding
     is done is not specified, so this operation may be used validly in
     compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.

'(unsigned_fix:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting floating point value X to fixed
     point mode M, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done is not
     specified.

'(fract_convert:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed-point value X to
     fixed-point mode M, signed integer value X to fixed-point mode M,
     floating-point value X to fixed-point mode M, fixed-point value X
     to integer mode M regarded as signed, or fixed-point value X to
     floating-point mode M.  When overflows or underflows happen, the
     results are undefined.

'(sat_fract:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed-point value X to
     fixed-point mode M, signed integer value X to fixed-point mode M,
     or floating-point value X to fixed-point mode M.  When overflows or
     underflows happen, the results are saturated to the maximum or the
     minimum.

'(unsigned_fract_convert:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed-point value X to integer
     mode M regarded as unsigned, or unsigned integer value X to
     fixed-point mode M.  When overflows or underflows happen, the
     results are undefined.

'(unsigned_sat_fract:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting unsigned integer value X to
     fixed-point mode M.  When overflows or underflows happen, the
     results are saturated to the maximum or the minimum.

13.14 Declarations
==================

Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations but
rather state assertions about their operands.

'(strict_low_part (subreg:M (reg:N R) 0))'
     This expression code is used in only one context: as the
     destination operand of a 'set' expression.  In addition, the
     operand of this expression must be a non-paradoxical 'subreg'
     expression.

     The presence of 'strict_low_part' says that the part of the
     register which is meaningful in mode N, but is not part of mode M,
     is not to be altered.  Normally, an assignment to such a subreg is
     allowed to have undefined effects on the rest of the register when
     M is less than a word.

13.15 Side Effect Expressions
=============================

The expression codes described so far represent values, not actions.
But machine instructions never produce values; they are meaningful only
for their side effects on the state of the machine.  Special expression
codes are used to represent side effects.

 The body of an instruction is always one of these side effect codes;
the codes described above, which represent values, appear only as the
operands of these.

'(set LVAL X)'
     Represents the action of storing the value of X into the place
     represented by LVAL.  LVAL must be an expression representing a
     place that can be stored in: 'reg' (or 'subreg', 'strict_low_part'
     or 'zero_extract'), 'mem', 'pc', 'parallel', or 'cc0'.

     If LVAL is a 'reg', 'subreg' or 'mem', it has a machine mode; then
     X must be valid for that mode.

     If LVAL is a 'reg' whose machine mode is less than the full width
     of the register, then it means that the part of the register
     specified by the machine mode is given the specified value and the
     rest of the register receives an undefined value.  Likewise, if
     LVAL is a 'subreg' whose machine mode is narrower than the mode of
     the register, the rest of the register can be changed in an
     undefined way.

     If LVAL is a 'strict_low_part' of a subreg, then the part of the
     register specified by the machine mode of the 'subreg' is given the
     value X and the rest of the register is not changed.

     If LVAL is a 'zero_extract', then the referenced part of the
     bit-field (a memory or register reference) specified by the
     'zero_extract' is given the value X and the rest of the bit-field
     is not changed.  Note that 'sign_extract' can not appear in LVAL.

     If LVAL is '(cc0)', it has no machine mode, and X may be either a
     'compare' expression or a value that may have any mode.  The latter
     case represents a "test" instruction.  The expression '(set (cc0)
     (reg:M N))' is equivalent to '(set (cc0) (compare (reg:M N)
     (const_int 0)))'.  Use the former expression to save space during
     the compilation.

     If LVAL is a 'parallel', it is used to represent the case of a
     function returning a structure in multiple registers.  Each element
     of the 'parallel' is an 'expr_list' whose first operand is a 'reg'
     and whose second operand is a 'const_int' representing the offset
     (in bytes) into the structure at which the data in that register
     corresponds.  The first element may be null to indicate that the
     structure is also passed partly in memory.

     If LVAL is '(pc)', we have a jump instruction, and the
     possibilities for X are very limited.  It may be a 'label_ref'
     expression (unconditional jump).  It may be an 'if_then_else'
     (conditional jump), in which case either the second or the third
     operand must be '(pc)' (for the case which does not jump) and the
     other of the two must be a 'label_ref' (for the case which does
     jump).  X may also be a 'mem' or '(plus:SI (pc) Y)', where Y may be
     a 'reg' or a 'mem'; these unusual patterns are used to represent
     jumps through branch tables.

     If LVAL is neither '(cc0)' nor '(pc)', the mode of LVAL must not be
     'VOIDmode' and the mode of X must be valid for the mode of LVAL.

     LVAL is customarily accessed with the 'SET_DEST' macro and X with
     the 'SET_SRC' macro.

'(return)'
     As the sole expression in a pattern, represents a return from the
     current function, on machines where this can be done with one
     instruction, such as VAXen.  On machines where a multi-instruction
     "epilogue" must be executed in order to return from the function,
     returning is done by jumping to a label which precedes the
     epilogue, and the 'return' expression code is never used.

     Inside an 'if_then_else' expression, represents the value to be
     placed in 'pc' to return to the caller.

     Note that an insn pattern of '(return)' is logically equivalent to
     '(set (pc) (return))', but the latter form is never used.

'(simple_return)'
     Like '(return)', but truly represents only a function return, while
     '(return)' may represent an insn that also performs other functions
     of the function epilogue.  Like '(return)', this may also occur in
     conditional jumps.

'(call FUNCTION NARGS)'
     Represents a function call.  FUNCTION is a 'mem' expression whose
     address is the address of the function to be called.  NARGS is an
     expression which can be used for two purposes: on some machines it
     represents the number of bytes of stack argument; on others, it
     represents the number of argument registers.

     Each machine has a standard machine mode which FUNCTION must have.
     The machine description defines macro 'FUNCTION_MODE' to expand
     into the requisite mode name.  The purpose of this mode is to
     specify what kind of addressing is allowed, on machines where the
     allowed kinds of addressing depend on the machine mode being
     addressed.

'(clobber X)'
     Represents the storing or possible storing of an unpredictable,
     undescribed value into X, which must be a 'reg', 'scratch',
     'parallel' or 'mem' expression.

     One place this is used is in string instructions that store
     standard values into particular hard registers.  It may not be
     worth the trouble to describe the values that are stored, but it is
     essential to inform the compiler that the registers will be
     altered, lest it attempt to keep data in them across the string
     instruction.

     If X is '(mem:BLK (const_int 0))' or '(mem:BLK (scratch))', it
     means that all memory locations must be presumed clobbered.  If X
     is a 'parallel', it has the same meaning as a 'parallel' in a 'set'
     expression.

     Note that the machine description classifies certain hard registers
     as "call-clobbered".  All function call instructions are assumed by
     default to clobber these registers, so there is no need to use
     'clobber' expressions to indicate this fact.  Also, each function
     call is assumed to have the potential to alter any memory location,
     unless the function is declared 'const'.

     If the last group of expressions in a 'parallel' are each a
     'clobber' expression whose arguments are 'reg' or 'match_scratch'
     (*note RTL Template::) expressions, the combiner phase can add the
     appropriate 'clobber' expressions to an insn it has constructed
     when doing so will cause a pattern to be matched.

     This feature can be used, for example, on a machine that whose
     multiply and add instructions don't use an MQ register but which
     has an add-accumulate instruction that does clobber the MQ
     register.  Similarly, a combined instruction might require a
     temporary register while the constituent instructions might not.

     When a 'clobber' expression for a register appears inside a
     'parallel' with other side effects, the register allocator
     guarantees that the register is unoccupied both before and after
     that insn if it is a hard register clobber.  For pseudo-register
     clobber, the register allocator and the reload pass do not assign
     the same hard register to the clobber and the input operands if
     there is an insn alternative containing the '&' constraint (*note
     Modifiers::) for the clobber and the hard register is in register
     classes of the clobber in the alternative.  You can clobber either
     a specific hard register, a pseudo register, or a 'scratch'
     expression; in the latter two cases, GCC will allocate a hard
     register that is available there for use as a temporary.

     For instructions that require a temporary register, you should use
     'scratch' instead of a pseudo-register because this will allow the
     combiner phase to add the 'clobber' when required.  You do this by
     coding ('clobber' ('match_scratch' ...)).  If you do clobber a
     pseudo register, use one which appears nowhere else--generate a new
     one each time.  Otherwise, you may confuse CSE.

     There is one other known use for clobbering a pseudo register in a
     'parallel': when one of the input operands of the insn is also
     clobbered by the insn.  In this case, using the same pseudo
     register in the clobber and elsewhere in the insn produces the
     expected results.

'(use X)'
     Represents the use of the value of X.  It indicates that the value
     in X at this point in the program is needed, even though it may not
     be apparent why this is so.  Therefore, the compiler will not
     attempt to delete previous instructions whose only effect is to
     store a value in X.  X must be a 'reg' expression.

     In some situations, it may be tempting to add a 'use' of a register
     in a 'parallel' to describe a situation where the value of a
     special register will modify the behavior of the instruction.  A
     hypothetical example might be a pattern for an addition that can
     either wrap around or use saturating addition depending on the
     value of a special control register:

          (parallel [(set (reg:SI 2) (unspec:SI [(reg:SI 3)
                                                 (reg:SI 4)] 0))
                     (use (reg:SI 1))])

     This will not work, several of the optimizers only look at
     expressions locally; it is very likely that if you have multiple
     insns with identical inputs to the 'unspec', they will be optimized
     away even if register 1 changes in between.

     This means that 'use' can _only_ be used to describe that the
     register is live.  You should think twice before adding 'use'
     statements, more often you will want to use 'unspec' instead.  The
     'use' RTX is most commonly useful to describe that a fixed register
     is implicitly used in an insn.  It is also safe to use in patterns
     where the compiler knows for other reasons that the result of the
     whole pattern is variable, such as 'movmemM' or 'call' patterns.

     During the reload phase, an insn that has a 'use' as pattern can
     carry a reg_equal note.  These 'use' insns will be deleted before
     the reload phase exits.

     During the delayed branch scheduling phase, X may be an insn.  This
     indicates that X previously was located at this place in the code
     and its data dependencies need to be taken into account.  These
     'use' insns will be deleted before the delayed branch scheduling
     phase exits.

'(parallel [X0 X1 ...])'
     Represents several side effects performed in parallel.  The square
     brackets stand for a vector; the operand of 'parallel' is a vector
     of expressions.  X0, X1 and so on are individual side effect
     expressions--expressions of code 'set', 'call', 'return',
     'simple_return', 'clobber' or 'use'.

     "In parallel" means that first all the values used in the
     individual side-effects are computed, and second all the actual
     side-effects are performed.  For example,

          (parallel [(set (reg:SI 1) (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)))
                     (set (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)) (reg:SI 1))])

     says unambiguously that the values of hard register 1 and the
     memory location addressed by it are interchanged.  In both places
     where '(reg:SI 1)' appears as a memory address it refers to the
     value in register 1 _before_ the execution of the insn.

     It follows that it is _incorrect_ to use 'parallel' and expect the
     result of one 'set' to be available for the next one.  For example,
     people sometimes attempt to represent a jump-if-zero instruction
     this way:

          (parallel [(set (cc0) (reg:SI 34))
                     (set (pc) (if_then_else
                                  (eq (cc0) (const_int 0))
                                  (label_ref ...)
                                  (pc)))])

     But this is incorrect, because it says that the jump condition
     depends on the condition code value _before_ this instruction, not
     on the new value that is set by this instruction.

     Peephole optimization, which takes place together with final
     assembly code output, can produce insns whose patterns consist of a
     'parallel' whose elements are the operands needed to output the
     resulting assembler code--often 'reg', 'mem' or constant
     expressions.  This would not be well-formed RTL at any other stage
     in compilation, but it is OK then because no further optimization
     remains to be done.  However, the definition of the macro
     'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC', if any, must deal with such insns if you define
     any peephole optimizations.

'(cond_exec [COND EXPR])'
     Represents a conditionally executed expression.  The EXPR is
     executed only if the COND is nonzero.  The COND expression must not
     have side-effects, but the EXPR may very well have side-effects.

'(sequence [INSNS ...])'
     Represents a sequence of insns.  If a 'sequence' appears in the
     chain of insns, then each of the INSNS that appears in the sequence
     must be suitable for appearing in the chain of insns, i.e.  must
     satisfy the 'INSN_P' predicate.

     After delay-slot scheduling is completed, an insn and all the insns
     that reside in its delay slots are grouped together into a
     'sequence'.  The insn requiring the delay slot is the first insn in
     the vector; subsequent insns are to be placed in the delay slot.

     'INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is set on an insn in a delay slot to
     indicate that a branch insn should be used that will conditionally
     annul the effect of the insns in the delay slots.  In such a case,
     'INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' indicates that the insn is from the target of
     the branch and should be executed only if the branch is taken;
     otherwise the insn should be executed only if the branch is not
     taken.  *Note Delay Slots::.

     Some back ends also use 'sequence' objects for purposes other than
     delay-slot groups.  This is not supported in the common parts of
     the compiler, which treat such sequences as delay-slot groups.

     DWARF2 Call Frame Address (CFA) adjustments are sometimes also
     expressed using 'sequence' objects as the value of a
     'RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P' note.  This only happens if the CFA
     adjustments cannot be easily derived from the pattern of the
     instruction to which the note is attached.  In such cases, the
     value of the note is used instead of best-guesing the semantics of
     the instruction.  The back end can attach notes containing a
     'sequence' of 'set' patterns that express the effect of the parent
     instruction.

 These expression codes appear in place of a side effect, as the body of
an insn, though strictly speaking they do not always describe side
effects as such:

'(asm_input S)'
     Represents literal assembler code as described by the string S.

'(unspec [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
'(unspec_volatile [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
     Represents a machine-specific operation on OPERANDS.  INDEX selects
     between multiple machine-specific operations.  'unspec_volatile' is
     used for volatile operations and operations that may trap; 'unspec'
     is used for other operations.

     These codes may appear inside a 'pattern' of an insn, inside a
     'parallel', or inside an expression.

'(addr_vec:M [LR0 LR1 ...])'
     Represents a table of jump addresses.  The vector elements LR0,
     etc., are 'label_ref' expressions.  The mode M specifies how much
     space is given to each address; normally M would be 'Pmode'.

'(addr_diff_vec:M BASE [LR0 LR1 ...] MIN MAX FLAGS)'
     Represents a table of jump addresses expressed as offsets from
     BASE.  The vector elements LR0, etc., are 'label_ref' expressions
     and so is BASE.  The mode M specifies how much space is given to
     each address-difference.  MIN and MAX are set up by branch
     shortening and hold a label with a minimum and a maximum address,
     respectively.  FLAGS indicates the relative position of BASE, MIN
     and MAX to the containing insn and of MIN and MAX to BASE.  See
     rtl.def for details.

'(prefetch:M ADDR RW LOCALITY)'
     Represents prefetch of memory at address ADDR.  Operand RW is 1 if
     the prefetch is for data to be written, 0 otherwise; targets that
     do not support write prefetches should treat this as a normal
     prefetch.  Operand LOCALITY specifies the amount of temporal
     locality; 0 if there is none or 1, 2, or 3 for increasing levels of
     temporal locality; targets that do not support locality hints
     should ignore this.

     This insn is used to minimize cache-miss latency by moving data
     into a cache before it is accessed.  It should use only
     non-faulting data prefetch instructions.

13.16 Embedded Side-Effects on Addresses
========================================

Six special side-effect expression codes appear as memory addresses.

'(pre_dec:M X)'
     Represents the side effect of decrementing X by a standard amount
     and represents also the value that X has after being decremented.
     X must be a 'reg' or 'mem', but most machines allow only a 'reg'.
     M must be the machine mode for pointers on the machine in use.  The
     amount X is decremented by is the length in bytes of the machine
     mode of the containing memory reference of which this expression
     serves as the address.  Here is an example of its use:

          (mem:DF (pre_dec:SI (reg:SI 39)))

     This says to decrement pseudo register 39 by the length of a
     'DFmode' value and use the result to address a 'DFmode' value.

'(pre_inc:M X)'
     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.

'(post_dec:M X)'
     Represents the same side effect as 'pre_dec' but a different value.
     The value represented here is the value X has before being
     decremented.

'(post_inc:M X)'
     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.

'(post_modify:M X Y)'

     Represents the side effect of setting X to Y and represents X
     before X is modified.  X must be a 'reg' or 'mem', but most
     machines allow only a 'reg'.  M must be the machine mode for
     pointers on the machine in use.

     The expression Y must be one of three forms: '(plus:M X Z)',
     '(minus:M X Z)', or '(plus:M X I)', where Z is an index register
     and I is a constant.

     Here is an example of its use:

          (mem:SF (post_modify:SI (reg:SI 42) (plus (reg:SI 42)
                                                    (reg:SI 48))))

     This says to modify pseudo register 42 by adding the contents of
     pseudo register 48 to it, after the use of what ever 42 points to.

'(pre_modify:M X EXPR)'
     Similar except side effects happen before the use.

 These embedded side effect expressions must be used with care.
Instruction patterns may not use them.  Until the 'flow' pass of the
compiler, they may occur only to represent pushes onto the stack.  The
'flow' pass finds cases where registers are incremented or decremented
in one instruction and used as an address shortly before or after; these
cases are then transformed to use pre- or post-increment or -decrement.

 If a register used as the operand of these expressions is used in
another address in an insn, the original value of the register is used.
Uses of the register outside of an address are not permitted within the
same insn as a use in an embedded side effect expression because such
insns behave differently on different machines and hence must be treated
as ambiguous and disallowed.

 An instruction that can be represented with an embedded side effect
could also be represented using 'parallel' containing an additional
'set' to describe how the address register is altered.  This is not done
because machines that allow these operations at all typically allow them
wherever a memory address is called for.  Describing them as additional
parallel stores would require doubling the number of entries in the
machine description.

13.17 Assembler Instructions as Expressions
===========================================

The RTX code 'asm_operands' represents a value produced by a
user-specified assembler instruction.  It is used to represent an 'asm'
statement with arguments.  An 'asm' statement with a single output
operand, like this:

     asm ("foo %1,%2,%0" : "=a" (outputvar) : "g" (x + y), "di" (*z));

is represented using a single 'asm_operands' RTX which represents the
value that is stored in 'outputvar':

     (set RTX-FOR-OUTPUTVAR
          (asm_operands "foo %1,%2,%0" "a" 0
                        [RTX-FOR-ADDITION-RESULT RTX-FOR-*Z]
                        [(asm_input:M1 "g")
                         (asm_input:M2 "di")]))

Here the operands of the 'asm_operands' RTX are the assembler template
string, the output-operand's constraint, the index-number of the output
operand among the output operands specified, a vector of input operand
RTX's, and a vector of input-operand modes and constraints.  The mode M1
is the mode of the sum 'x+y'; M2 is that of '*z'.

 When an 'asm' statement has multiple output values, its insn has
several such 'set' RTX's inside of a 'parallel'.  Each 'set' contains an
'asm_operands'; all of these share the same assembler template and
vectors, but each contains the constraint for the respective output
operand.  They are also distinguished by the output-operand index
number, which is 0, 1, ... for successive output operands.

13.18 Variable Location Debug Information in RTL
================================================

Variable tracking relies on 'MEM_EXPR' and 'REG_EXPR' annotations to
determine what user variables memory and register references refer to.

 Variable tracking at assignments uses these notes only when they refer
to variables that live at fixed locations (e.g., addressable variables,
global non-automatic variables).  For variables whose location may vary,
it relies on the following types of notes.

'(var_location:MODE VAR EXP STAT)'
     Binds variable 'var', a tree, to value EXP, an RTL expression.  It
     appears only in 'NOTE_INSN_VAR_LOCATION' and 'DEBUG_INSN's, with
     slightly different meanings.  MODE, if present, represents the mode
     of EXP, which is useful if it is a modeless expression.  STAT is
     only meaningful in notes, indicating whether the variable is known
     to be initialized or uninitialized.

'(debug_expr:MODE DECL)'
     Stands for the value bound to the 'DEBUG_EXPR_DECL' DECL, that
     points back to it, within value expressions in 'VAR_LOCATION'
     nodes.

13.19 Insns
===========

The RTL representation of the code for a function is a doubly-linked
chain of objects called "insns".  Insns are expressions with special
codes that are used for no other purpose.  Some insns are actual
instructions; others represent dispatch tables for 'switch' statements;
others represent labels to jump to or various sorts of declarative
information.

 In addition to its own specific data, each insn must have a unique
id-number that distinguishes it from all other insns in the current
function (after delayed branch scheduling, copies of an insn with the
same id-number may be present in multiple places in a function, but
these copies will always be identical and will only appear inside a
'sequence'), and chain pointers to the preceding and following insns.
These three fields occupy the same position in every insn, independent
of the expression code of the insn.  They could be accessed with 'XEXP'
and 'XINT', but instead three special macros are always used:

'INSN_UID (I)'
     Accesses the unique id of insn I.

'PREV_INSN (I)'
     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn preceding I.  If I is the
     first insn, this is a null pointer.

'NEXT_INSN (I)'
     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn following I.  If I is the
     last insn, this is a null pointer.

 The first insn in the chain is obtained by calling 'get_insns'; the
last insn is the result of calling 'get_last_insn'.  Within the chain
delimited by these insns, the 'NEXT_INSN' and 'PREV_INSN' pointers must
always correspond: if INSN is not the first insn,

     NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN)) == INSN

is always true and if INSN is not the last insn,

     PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (INSN)) == INSN

is always true.

 After delay slot scheduling, some of the insns in the chain might be
'sequence' expressions, which contain a vector of insns.  The value of
'NEXT_INSN' in all but the last of these insns is the next insn in the
vector; the value of 'NEXT_INSN' of the last insn in the vector is the
same as the value of 'NEXT_INSN' for the 'sequence' in which it is
contained.  Similar rules apply for 'PREV_INSN'.

 This means that the above invariants are not necessarily true for insns
inside 'sequence' expressions.  Specifically, if INSN is the first insn
in a 'sequence', 'NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN))' is the insn containing
the 'sequence' expression, as is the value of 'PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN
(INSN))' if INSN is the last insn in the 'sequence' expression.  You can
use these expressions to find the containing 'sequence' expression.

 Every insn has one of the following expression codes:

'insn'
     The expression code 'insn' is used for instructions that do not
     jump and do not do function calls.  'sequence' expressions are
     always contained in insns with code 'insn' even if one of those
     insns should jump or do function calls.

     Insns with code 'insn' have four additional fields beyond the three
     mandatory ones listed above.  These four are described in a table
     below.

'jump_insn'
     The expression code 'jump_insn' is used for instructions that may
     jump (or, more generally, may contain 'label_ref' expressions to
     which 'pc' can be set in that instruction).  If there is an
     instruction to return from the current function, it is recorded as
     a 'jump_insn'.

     'jump_insn' insns have the same extra fields as 'insn' insns,
     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
     'JUMP_LABEL' which is defined once jump optimization has completed.

     For simple conditional and unconditional jumps, this field contains
     the 'code_label' to which this insn will (possibly conditionally)
     branch.  In a more complex jump, 'JUMP_LABEL' records one of the
     labels that the insn refers to; other jump target labels are
     recorded as 'REG_LABEL_TARGET' notes.  The exception is 'addr_vec'
     and 'addr_diff_vec', where 'JUMP_LABEL' is 'NULL_RTX' and the only
     way to find the labels is to scan the entire body of the insn.

     Return insns count as jumps, but since they do not refer to any
     labels, their 'JUMP_LABEL' is 'NULL_RTX'.

'call_insn'
     The expression code 'call_insn' is used for instructions that may
     do function calls.  It is important to distinguish these
     instructions because they imply that certain registers and memory
     locations may be altered unpredictably.

     'call_insn' insns have the same extra fields as 'insn' insns,
     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
     'CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE', which contains a list (chain of
     'expr_list' expressions) containing 'use', 'clobber' and sometimes
     'set' expressions that denote hard registers and 'mem's used or
     clobbered by the called function.

     A 'mem' generally points to a stack slot in which arguments passed
     to the libcall by reference (*note TARGET_PASS_BY_REFERENCE:
     Register Arguments.) are stored.  If the argument is caller-copied
     (*note TARGET_CALLEE_COPIES: Register Arguments.), the stack slot
     will be mentioned in 'clobber' and 'use' entries; if it's
     callee-copied, only a 'use' will appear, and the 'mem' may point to
     addresses that are not stack slots.

     Registers occurring inside a 'clobber' in this list augment
     registers specified in 'CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register
     Basics::).

     If the list contains a 'set' involving two registers, it indicates
     that the function returns one of its arguments.  Such a 'set' may
     look like a no-op if the same register holds the argument and the
     return value.

'code_label'
     A 'code_label' insn represents a label that a jump insn can jump
     to.  It contains two special fields of data in addition to the
     three standard ones.  'CODE_LABEL_NUMBER' is used to hold the
     "label number", a number that identifies this label uniquely among
     all the labels in the compilation (not just in the current
     function).  Ultimately, the label is represented in the assembler
     output as an assembler label, usually of the form 'LN' where N is
     the label number.

     When a 'code_label' appears in an RTL expression, it normally
     appears within a 'label_ref' which represents the address of the
     label, as a number.

     Besides as a 'code_label', a label can also be represented as a
     'note' of type 'NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL'.

     The field 'LABEL_NUSES' is only defined once the jump optimization
     phase is completed.  It contains the number of times this label is
     referenced in the current function.

     The field 'LABEL_KIND' differentiates four different types of
     labels: 'LABEL_NORMAL', 'LABEL_STATIC_ENTRY', 'LABEL_GLOBAL_ENTRY',
     and 'LABEL_WEAK_ENTRY'.  The only labels that do not have type
     'LABEL_NORMAL' are "alternate entry points" to the current
     function.  These may be static (visible only in the containing
     translation unit), global (exposed to all translation units), or
     weak (global, but can be overridden by another symbol with the same
     name).

     Much of the compiler treats all four kinds of label identically.
     Some of it needs to know whether or not a label is an alternate
     entry point; for this purpose, the macro 'LABEL_ALT_ENTRY_P' is
     provided.  It is equivalent to testing whether 'LABEL_KIND (label)
     == LABEL_NORMAL'.  The only place that cares about the distinction
     between static, global, and weak alternate entry points, besides
     the front-end code that creates them, is the function
     'output_alternate_entry_point', in 'final.c'.

     To set the kind of a label, use the 'SET_LABEL_KIND' macro.

'jump_table_data'
     A 'jump_table_data' insn is a placeholder for the jump-table data
     of a 'casesi' or 'tablejump' insn.  They are placed after a
     'tablejump_p' insn.  A 'jump_table_data' insn is not part o a basic
     blockm but it is associated with the basic block that ends with the
     'tablejump_p' insn.  The 'PATTERN' of a 'jump_table_data' is always
     either an 'addr_vec' or an 'addr_diff_vec', and a 'jump_table_data'
     insn is always preceded by a 'code_label'.  The 'tablejump_p' insn
     refers to that 'code_label' via its 'JUMP_LABEL'.

'barrier'
     Barriers are placed in the instruction stream when control cannot
     flow past them.  They are placed after unconditional jump
     instructions to indicate that the jumps are unconditional and after
     calls to 'volatile' functions, which do not return (e.g., 'exit').
     They contain no information beyond the three standard fields.

'note'
     'note' insns are used to represent additional debugging and
     declarative information.  They contain two nonstandard fields, an
     integer which is accessed with the macro 'NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' and a
     string accessed with 'NOTE_SOURCE_FILE'.

     If 'NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is positive, the note represents the position
     of a source line and 'NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' is the source file name
     that the line came from.  These notes control generation of line
     number data in the assembler output.

     Otherwise, 'NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is not really a line number but a
     code with one of the following values (and 'NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' must
     contain a null pointer):

     'NOTE_INSN_DELETED'
          Such a note is completely ignorable.  Some passes of the
          compiler delete insns by altering them into notes of this
          kind.

     'NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL'
          This marks what used to be a 'code_label', but was not used
          for other purposes than taking its address and was transformed
          to mark that no code jumps to it.

     'NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_BEG'
     'NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a level of scoping of variable names.  They control
          the output of debugging information.

     'NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_BEG'
     'NOTE_INSN_EH_REGION_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a level of scoping for exception handling.
          'NOTE_EH_HANDLER' identifies which region is associated with
          these notes.

     'NOTE_INSN_FUNCTION_BEG'
          Appears at the start of the function body, after the function
          prologue.

     'NOTE_INSN_VAR_LOCATION'
          This note is used to generate variable location debugging
          information.  It indicates that the user variable in its
          'VAR_LOCATION' operand is at the location given in the RTL
          expression, or holds a value that can be computed by
          evaluating the RTL expression from that static point in the
          program up to the next such note for the same user variable.

     These codes are printed symbolically when they appear in debugging
     dumps.

'debug_insn'
     The expression code 'debug_insn' is used for pseudo-instructions
     that hold debugging information for variable tracking at
     assignments (see '-fvar-tracking-assignments' option).  They are
     the RTL representation of 'GIMPLE_DEBUG' statements (*note
     'GIMPLE_DEBUG'::), with a 'VAR_LOCATION' operand that binds a user
     variable tree to an RTL representation of the 'value' in the
     corresponding statement.  A 'DEBUG_EXPR' in it stands for the value
     bound to the corresponding 'DEBUG_EXPR_DECL'.

     Throughout optimization passes, binding information is kept in
     pseudo-instruction form, so that, unlike notes, it gets the same
     treatment and adjustments that regular instructions would.  It is
     the variable tracking pass that turns these pseudo-instructions
     into var location notes, analyzing control flow, value equivalences
     and changes to registers and memory referenced in value
     expressions, propagating the values of debug temporaries and
     determining expressions that can be used to compute the value of
     each user variable at as many points (ranges, actually) in the
     program as possible.

     Unlike 'NOTE_INSN_VAR_LOCATION', the value expression in an
     'INSN_VAR_LOCATION' denotes a value at that specific point in the
     program, rather than an expression that can be evaluated at any
     later point before an overriding 'VAR_LOCATION' is encountered.
     E.g., if a user variable is bound to a 'REG' and then a subsequent
     insn modifies the 'REG', the note location would keep mapping the
     user variable to the register across the insn, whereas the insn
     location would keep the variable bound to the value, so that the
     variable tracking pass would emit another location note for the
     variable at the point in which the register is modified.

 The machine mode of an insn is normally 'VOIDmode', but some phases use
the mode for various purposes.

 The common subexpression elimination pass sets the mode of an insn to
'QImode' when it is the first insn in a block that has already been
processed.

 The second Haifa scheduling pass, for targets that can multiple issue,
sets the mode of an insn to 'TImode' when it is believed that the
instruction begins an issue group.  That is, when the instruction cannot
issue simultaneously with the previous.  This may be relied on by later
passes, in particular machine-dependent reorg.

 Here is a table of the extra fields of 'insn', 'jump_insn' and
'call_insn' insns:

'PATTERN (I)'
     An expression for the side effect performed by this insn.  This
     must be one of the following codes: 'set', 'call', 'use',
     'clobber', 'return', 'simple_return', 'asm_input', 'asm_output',
     'addr_vec', 'addr_diff_vec', 'trap_if', 'unspec',
     'unspec_volatile', 'parallel', 'cond_exec', or 'sequence'.  If it
     is a 'parallel', each element of the 'parallel' must be one these
     codes, except that 'parallel' expressions cannot be nested and
     'addr_vec' and 'addr_diff_vec' are not permitted inside a
     'parallel' expression.

'INSN_CODE (I)'
     An integer that says which pattern in the machine description
     matches this insn, or -1 if the matching has not yet been
     attempted.

     Such matching is never attempted and this field remains -1 on an
     insn whose pattern consists of a single 'use', 'clobber',
     'asm_input', 'addr_vec' or 'addr_diff_vec' expression.

     Matching is also never attempted on insns that result from an 'asm'
     statement.  These contain at least one 'asm_operands' expression.
     The function 'asm_noperands' returns a non-negative value for such
     insns.

     In the debugging output, this field is printed as a number followed
     by a symbolic representation that locates the pattern in the 'md'
     file as some small positive or negative offset from a named
     pattern.

'LOG_LINKS (I)'
     A list (chain of 'insn_list' expressions) giving information about
     dependencies between instructions within a basic block.  Neither a
     jump nor a label may come between the related insns.  These are
     only used by the schedulers and by combine.  This is a deprecated
     data structure.  Def-use and use-def chains are now preferred.

'REG_NOTES (I)'
     A list (chain of 'expr_list', 'insn_list' and 'int_list'
     expressions) giving miscellaneous information about the insn.  It
     is often information pertaining to the registers used in this insn.

 The 'LOG_LINKS' field of an insn is a chain of 'insn_list' expressions.
Each of these has two operands: the first is an insn, and the second is
another 'insn_list' expression (the next one in the chain).  The last
'insn_list' in the chain has a null pointer as second operand.  The
significant thing about the chain is which insns appear in it (as first
operands of 'insn_list' expressions).  Their order is not significant.

 This list is originally set up by the flow analysis pass; it is a null
pointer until then.  Flow only adds links for those data dependencies
which can be used for instruction combination.  For each insn, the flow
analysis pass adds a link to insns which store into registers values
that are used for the first time in this insn.

 The 'REG_NOTES' field of an insn is a chain similar to the 'LOG_LINKS'
field but it includes 'expr_list' and 'int_list' expressions in addition
to 'insn_list' expressions.  There are several kinds of register notes,
which are distinguished by the machine mode, which in a register note is
really understood as being an 'enum reg_note'.  The first operand OP of
the note is data whose meaning depends on the kind of note.

 The macro 'REG_NOTE_KIND (X)' returns the kind of register note.  Its
counterpart, the macro 'PUT_REG_NOTE_KIND (X, NEWKIND)' sets the
register note type of X to be NEWKIND.

 Register notes are of three classes: They may say something about an
input to an insn, they may say something about an output of an insn, or
they may create a linkage between two insns.  There are also a set of
values that are only used in 'LOG_LINKS'.

 These register notes annotate inputs to an insn:

'REG_DEAD'
     The value in OP dies in this insn; that is to say, altering the
     value immediately after this insn would not affect the future
     behavior of the program.

     It does not follow that the register OP has no useful value after
     this insn since OP is not necessarily modified by this insn.
     Rather, no subsequent instruction uses the contents of OP.

'REG_UNUSED'
     The register OP being set by this insn will not be used in a
     subsequent insn.  This differs from a 'REG_DEAD' note, which
     indicates that the value in an input will not be used subsequently.
     These two notes are independent; both may be present for the same
     register.

'REG_INC'
     The register OP is incremented (or decremented; at this level there
     is no distinction) by an embedded side effect inside this insn.
     This means it appears in a 'post_inc', 'pre_inc', 'post_dec' or
     'pre_dec' expression.

'REG_NONNEG'
     The register OP is known to have a nonnegative value when this insn
     is reached.  This is used so that decrement and branch until zero
     instructions, such as the m68k dbra, can be matched.

     The 'REG_NONNEG' note is added to insns only if the machine
     description has a 'decrement_and_branch_until_zero' pattern.

'REG_LABEL_OPERAND'
     This insn uses OP, a 'code_label' or a 'note' of type
     'NOTE_INSN_DELETED_LABEL', but is not a 'jump_insn', or it is a
     'jump_insn' that refers to the operand as an ordinary operand.  The
     label may still eventually be a jump target, but if so in an
     indirect jump in a subsequent insn.  The presence of this note
     allows jump optimization to be aware that OP is, in fact, being
     used, and flow optimization to build an accurate flow graph.

'REG_LABEL_TARGET'
     This insn is a 'jump_insn' but not an 'addr_vec' or
     'addr_diff_vec'.  It uses OP, a 'code_label' as a direct or
     indirect jump target.  Its purpose is similar to that of
     'REG_LABEL_OPERAND'.  This note is only present if the insn has
     multiple targets; the last label in the insn (in the highest
     numbered insn-field) goes into the 'JUMP_LABEL' field and does not
     have a 'REG_LABEL_TARGET' note.  *Note JUMP_LABEL: Insns.

'REG_CROSSING_JUMP'
     This insn is a branching instruction (either an unconditional jump
     or an indirect jump) which crosses between hot and cold sections,
     which could potentially be very far apart in the executable.  The
     presence of this note indicates to other optimizations that this
     branching instruction should not be "collapsed" into a simpler
     branching construct.  It is used when the optimization to partition
     basic blocks into hot and cold sections is turned on.

'REG_SETJMP'
     Appears attached to each 'CALL_INSN' to 'setjmp' or a related
     function.

 The following notes describe attributes of outputs of an insn:

'REG_EQUIV'
'REG_EQUAL'
     This note is only valid on an insn that sets only one register and
     indicates that that register will be equal to OP at run time; the
     scope of this equivalence differs between the two types of notes.
     The value which the insn explicitly copies into the register may
     look different from OP, but they will be equal at run time.  If the
     output of the single 'set' is a 'strict_low_part' expression, the
     note refers to the register that is contained in 'SUBREG_REG' of
     the 'subreg' expression.

     For 'REG_EQUIV', the register is equivalent to OP throughout the
     entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
     occurrences by OP.  ("Validly" here refers to the data flow of the
     program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
     example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
     assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.

     When a parameter is copied into a pseudo-register at entry to a
     function, a note of this kind records that the register is
     equivalent to the stack slot where the parameter was passed.
     Although in this case the register may be set by other insns, it is
     still valid to replace the register by the stack slot throughout
     the function.

     A 'REG_EQUIV' note is also used on an instruction which copies a
     register parameter into a pseudo-register at entry to a function,
     if there is a stack slot where that parameter could be stored.
     Although other insns may set the pseudo-register, it is valid for
     the compiler to replace the pseudo-register by stack slot
     throughout the function, provided the compiler ensures that the
     stack slot is properly initialized by making the replacement in the
     initial copy instruction as well.  This is used on machines for
     which the calling convention allocates stack space for register
     parameters.  See 'REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' in *note Stack Arguments::.

     In the case of 'REG_EQUAL', the register that is set by this insn
     will be equal to OP at run time at the end of this insn but not
     necessarily elsewhere in the function.  In this case, OP is
     typically an arithmetic expression.  For example, when a sequence
     of insns such as a library call is used to perform an arithmetic
     operation, this kind of note is attached to the insn that produces
     or copies the final value.

     These two notes are used in different ways by the compiler passes.
     'REG_EQUAL' is used by passes prior to register allocation (such as
     common subexpression elimination and loop optimization) to tell
     them how to think of that value.  'REG_EQUIV' notes are used by
     register allocation to indicate that there is an available
     substitute expression (either a constant or a 'mem' expression for
     the location of a parameter on the stack) that may be used in place
     of a register if insufficient registers are available.

     Except for stack homes for parameters, which are indicated by a
     'REG_EQUIV' note and are not useful to the early optimization
     passes and pseudo registers that are equivalent to a memory
     location throughout their entire life, which is not detected until
     later in the compilation, all equivalences are initially indicated
     by an attached 'REG_EQUAL' note.  In the early stages of register
     allocation, a 'REG_EQUAL' note is changed into a 'REG_EQUIV' note
     if OP is a constant and the insn represents the only set of its
     destination register.

     Thus, compiler passes prior to register allocation need only check
     for 'REG_EQUAL' notes and passes subsequent to register allocation
     need only check for 'REG_EQUIV' notes.

 These notes describe linkages between insns.  They occur in pairs: one
insn has one of a pair of notes that points to a second insn, which has
the inverse note pointing back to the first insn.

'REG_CC_SETTER'
'REG_CC_USER'
     On machines that use 'cc0', the insns which set and use 'cc0' set
     and use 'cc0' are adjacent.  However, when branch delay slot
     filling is done, this may no longer be true.  In this case a
     'REG_CC_USER' note will be placed on the insn setting 'cc0' to
     point to the insn using 'cc0' and a 'REG_CC_SETTER' note will be
     placed on the insn using 'cc0' to point to the insn setting 'cc0'.

 These values are only used in the 'LOG_LINKS' field, and indicate the
type of dependency that each link represents.  Links which indicate a
data dependence (a read after write dependence) do not use any code,
they simply have mode 'VOIDmode', and are printed without any
descriptive text.

'REG_DEP_TRUE'
     This indicates a true dependence (a read after write dependence).

'REG_DEP_OUTPUT'
     This indicates an output dependence (a write after write
     dependence).

'REG_DEP_ANTI'
     This indicates an anti dependence (a write after read dependence).

 These notes describe information gathered from gcov profile data.  They
are stored in the 'REG_NOTES' field of an insn.

'REG_BR_PROB'
     This is used to specify the ratio of branches to non-branches of a
     branch insn according to the profile data.  The note is represented
     as an 'int_list' expression whose integer value is between 0 and
     REG_BR_PROB_BASE. Larger values indicate a higher probability that
     the branch will be taken.

'REG_BR_PRED'
     These notes are found in JUMP insns after delayed branch scheduling
     has taken place.  They indicate both the direction and the
     likelihood of the JUMP.  The format is a bitmask of ATTR_FLAG_*
     values.

'REG_FRAME_RELATED_EXPR'
     This is used on an RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P insn wherein the attached
     expression is used in place of the actual insn pattern.  This is
     done in cases where the pattern is either complex or misleading.

 For convenience, the machine mode in an 'insn_list' or 'expr_list' is
printed using these symbolic codes in debugging dumps.

 The only difference between the expression codes 'insn_list' and
'expr_list' is that the first operand of an 'insn_list' is assumed to be
an insn and is printed in debugging dumps as the insn's unique id; the
first operand of an 'expr_list' is printed in the ordinary way as an
expression.

13.20 RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns
===============================================

Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code 'call_insn'.
These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a
special RTL expression code, 'call'.

 A 'call' expression has two operands, as follows:

     (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES)

Here NBYTES is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
argument data being passed to the subroutine, FM is a machine mode
(which must equal as the definition of the 'FUNCTION_MODE' macro in the
machine description) and ADDR represents the address of the subroutine.

 For a subroutine that returns no value, the 'call' expression as shown
above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might also
contain 'use' or 'clobber' expressions.

 For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not 'BLKmode', the
value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is R,
then the body of the call insn looks like this:

     (set (reg:M R)
          (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES))

This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.

 When a subroutine returns a 'BLKmode' value, it is handled by passing
to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value.  So the
call insn itself does not "return" any value, and it has the same RTL
form as a call that returns nothing.

 On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
for example to contain the return address.  'call_insn' insns on these
machines should have a body which is a 'parallel' that contains both the
'call' expression and 'clobber' expressions that indicate which
registers are destroyed.  Similarly, if the call instruction requires
some register other than the stack pointer that is not explicitly
mentioned in its RTL, a 'use' subexpression should mention that
register.

 Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed in
the configuration macro 'CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register Basics::)
and, with the exception of 'const' functions and library calls, to
modify all of memory.

 Insns containing just 'use' expressions directly precede the
'call_insn' insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
'CALL_USED_REGISTERS' are clobbered by the called function, insns
containing a single 'clobber' follow immediately after the call to
indicate which registers.

13.21 Structure Sharing Assumptions
===================================

The compiler assumes that certain kinds of RTL expressions are unique;
there do not exist two distinct objects representing the same value.  In
other cases, it makes an opposite assumption: that no RTL expression
object of a certain kind appears in more than one place in the
containing structure.

 These assumptions refer to a single function; except for the RTL
objects that describe global variables and external functions, and a few
standard objects such as small integer constants, no RTL objects are
common to two functions.

   * Each pseudo-register has only a single 'reg' object to represent
     it, and therefore only a single machine mode.

   * For any symbolic label, there is only one 'symbol_ref' object
     referring to it.

   * All 'const_int' expressions with equal values are shared.

   * There is only one 'pc' expression.

   * There is only one 'cc0' expression.

   * There is only one 'const_double' expression with value 0 for each
     floating point mode.  Likewise for values 1 and 2.

   * There is only one 'const_vector' expression with value 0 for each
     vector mode, be it an integer or a double constant vector.

   * No 'label_ref' or 'scratch' appears in more than one place in the
     RTL structure; in other words, it is safe to do a tree-walk of all
     the insns in the function and assume that each time a 'label_ref'
     or 'scratch' is seen it is distinct from all others that are seen.

   * Only one 'mem' object is normally created for each static variable
     or stack slot, so these objects are frequently shared in all the
     places they appear.  However, separate but equal objects for these
     variables are occasionally made.

   * When a single 'asm' statement has multiple output operands, a
     distinct 'asm_operands' expression is made for each output operand.
     However, these all share the vector which contains the sequence of
     input operands.  This sharing is used later on to test whether two
     'asm_operands' expressions come from the same statement, so all
     optimizations must carefully preserve the sharing if they copy the
     vector at all.

   * No RTL object appears in more than one place in the RTL structure
     except as described above.  Many passes of the compiler rely on
     this by assuming that they can modify RTL objects in place without
     unwanted side-effects on other insns.

   * During initial RTL generation, shared structure is freely
     introduced.  After all the RTL for a function has been generated,
     all shared structure is copied by 'unshare_all_rtl' in
     'emit-rtl.c', after which the above rules are guaranteed to be
     followed.

   * During the combiner pass, shared structure within an insn can exist
     temporarily.  However, the shared structure is copied before the
     combiner is finished with the insn.  This is done by calling
     'copy_rtx_if_shared', which is a subroutine of 'unshare_all_rtl'.

13.22 Reading RTL
=================

To read an RTL object from a file, call 'read_rtx'.  It takes one
argument, a stdio stream, and returns a single RTL object.  This routine
is defined in 'read-rtl.c'.  It is not available in the compiler itself,
only the various programs that generate the compiler back end from the
machine description.

 People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a file
as an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GCC.  This
idea is not feasible.

 GCC was designed to use RTL internally only.  Correct RTL for a given
program is very dependent on the particular target machine.  And the RTL
does not contain all the information about the program.

 The proper way to interface GCC to a new language front end is with the
"tree" data structure, described in the files 'tree.h' and 'tree.def'.
The documentation for this structure (*note GENERIC::) is incomplete.

14 Control Flow Graph
*********************

A control flow graph (CFG) is a data structure built on top of the
intermediate code representation (the RTL or 'GIMPLE' instruction
stream) abstracting the control flow behavior of a function that is
being compiled.  The CFG is a directed graph where the vertices
represent basic blocks and edges represent possible transfer of control
flow from one basic block to another.  The data structures used to
represent the control flow graph are defined in 'basic-block.h'.

 In GCC, the representation of control flow is maintained throughout the
compilation process, from constructing the CFG early in 'pass_build_cfg'
to 'pass_free_cfg' (see 'passes.def').  The CFG takes various different
modes and may undergo extensive manipulations, but the graph is always
valid between its construction and its release.  This way, transfer of
information such as data flow, a measured profile, or the loop tree, can
be propagated through the passes pipeline, and even from 'GIMPLE' to
'RTL'.

 Often the CFG may be better viewed as integral part of instruction
chain, than structure built on the top of it.  Updating the compiler's
intermediate representation for instructions can not be easily done
without proper maintenance of the CFG simultaneously.

14.1 Basic Blocks
=================

A basic block is a straight-line sequence of code with only one entry
point and only one exit.  In GCC, basic blocks are represented using the
'basic_block' data type.

 Special basic blocks represent possible entry and exit points of a
function.  These blocks are called 'ENTRY_BLOCK_PTR' and
'EXIT_BLOCK_PTR'.  These blocks do not contain any code.

 The 'BASIC_BLOCK' array contains all basic blocks in an unspecified
order.  Each 'basic_block' structure has a field that holds a unique
integer identifier 'index' that is the index of the block in the
'BASIC_BLOCK' array.  The total number of basic blocks in the function
is 'n_basic_blocks'.  Both the basic block indices and the total number
of basic blocks may vary during the compilation process, as passes
reorder, create, duplicate, and destroy basic blocks.  The index for any
block should never be greater than 'last_basic_block'.  The indices 0
and 1 are special codes reserved for 'ENTRY_BLOCK' and 'EXIT_BLOCK', the
indices of 'ENTRY_BLOCK_PTR' and 'EXIT_BLOCK_PTR'.

 Two pointer members of the 'basic_block' structure are the pointers
'next_bb' and 'prev_bb'.  These are used to keep doubly linked chain of
basic blocks in the same order as the underlying instruction stream.
The chain of basic blocks is updated transparently by the provided API
for manipulating the CFG.  The macro 'FOR_EACH_BB' can be used to visit
all the basic blocks in lexicographical order, except 'ENTRY_BLOCK' and
'EXIT_BLOCK'.  The macro 'FOR_ALL_BB' also visits all basic blocks in
lexicographical order, including 'ENTRY_BLOCK' and 'EXIT_BLOCK'.

 The functions 'post_order_compute' and 'inverted_post_order_compute'
can be used to compute topological orders of the CFG. The orders are
stored as vectors of basic block indices.  The 'BASIC_BLOCK' array can
be used to iterate each basic block by index.  Dominator traversals are
also possible using 'walk_dominator_tree'.  Given two basic blocks A and
B, block A dominates block B if A is _always_ executed before B.

 Each 'basic_block' also contains pointers to the first instruction (the
"head") and the last instruction (the "tail") or "end" of the
instruction stream contained in a basic block.  In fact, since the
'basic_block' data type is used to represent blocks in both major
intermediate representations of GCC ('GIMPLE' and RTL), there are
pointers to the head and end of a basic block for both representations,
stored in intermediate representation specific data in the 'il' field of
'struct basic_block_def'.

 For RTL, these pointers are 'BB_HEAD' and 'BB_END'.

 In the RTL representation of a function, the instruction stream
contains not only the "real" instructions, but also "notes" or "insn
notes" (to distinguish them from "reg notes").  Any function that moves
or duplicates the basic blocks needs to take care of updating of these
notes.  Many of these notes expect that the instruction stream consists
of linear regions, so updating can sometimes be tedious.  All types of
insn notes are defined in 'insn-notes.def'.

 In the RTL function representation, the instructions contained in a
basic block always follow a 'NOTE_INSN_BASIC_BLOCK', but zero or more
'CODE_LABEL' nodes can precede the block note.  A basic block ends with
a control flow instruction or with the last instruction before the next
'CODE_LABEL' or 'NOTE_INSN_BASIC_BLOCK'.  By definition, a 'CODE_LABEL'
cannot appear in the middle of the instruction stream of a basic block.

 In addition to notes, the jump table vectors are also represented as
"pseudo-instructions" inside the insn stream.  These vectors never
appear in the basic block and should always be placed just after the
table jump instructions referencing them.  After removing the table-jump
it is often difficult to eliminate the code computing the address and
referencing the vector, so cleaning up these vectors is postponed until
after liveness analysis.  Thus the jump table vectors may appear in the
insn stream unreferenced and without any purpose.  Before any edge is
made "fall-thru", the existence of such construct in the way needs to be
checked by calling 'can_fallthru' function.

 For the 'GIMPLE' representation, the PHI nodes and statements contained
in a basic block are in a 'gimple_seq' pointed to by the basic block
intermediate language specific pointers.  Abstract containers and
iterators are used to access the PHI nodes and statements in a basic
blocks.  These iterators are called "GIMPLE statement iterators" (GSIs).
Grep for '^gsi' in the various 'gimple-*' and 'tree-*' files.  The
following snippet will pretty-print all PHI nodes the statements of the
current function in the GIMPLE representation.

     basic_block bb;

     FOR_EACH_BB (bb)
       {
        gimple_stmt_iterator si;

        for (si = gsi_start_phis (bb); !gsi_end_p (si); gsi_next (&si))
          {
            gimple phi = gsi_stmt (si);
            print_gimple_stmt (dump_file, phi, 0, TDF_SLIM);
          }
        for (si = gsi_start_bb (bb); !gsi_end_p (si); gsi_next (&si))
          {
            gimple stmt = gsi_stmt (si);
            print_gimple_stmt (dump_file, stmt, 0, TDF_SLIM);
          }
       }

14.2 Edges
==========

Edges represent possible control flow transfers from the end of some
basic block A to the head of another basic block B.  We say that A is a
predecessor of B, and B is a successor of A.  Edges are represented in
GCC with the 'edge' data type.  Each 'edge' acts as a link between two
basic blocks: The 'src' member of an edge points to the predecessor
basic block of the 'dest' basic block.  The members 'preds' and 'succs'
of the 'basic_block' data type point to type-safe vectors of edges to
the predecessors and successors of the block.

 When walking the edges in an edge vector, "edge iterators" should be
used.  Edge iterators are constructed using the 'edge_iterator' data
structure and several methods are available to operate on them:

'ei_start'
     This function initializes an 'edge_iterator' that points to the
     first edge in a vector of edges.

'ei_last'
     This function initializes an 'edge_iterator' that points to the
     last edge in a vector of edges.

'ei_end_p'
     This predicate is 'true' if an 'edge_iterator' represents the last
     edge in an edge vector.

'ei_one_before_end_p'
     This predicate is 'true' if an 'edge_iterator' represents the
     second last edge in an edge vector.

'ei_next'
     This function takes a pointer to an 'edge_iterator' and makes it
     point to the next edge in the sequence.

'ei_prev'
     This function takes a pointer to an 'edge_iterator' and makes it
     point to the previous edge in the sequence.

'ei_edge'
     This function returns the 'edge' currently pointed to by an
     'edge_iterator'.

'ei_safe_safe'
     This function returns the 'edge' currently pointed to by an
     'edge_iterator', but returns 'NULL' if the iterator is pointing at
     the end of the sequence.  This function has been provided for
     existing code makes the assumption that a 'NULL' edge indicates the
     end of the sequence.

 The convenience macro 'FOR_EACH_EDGE' can be used to visit all of the
edges in a sequence of predecessor or successor edges.  It must not be
used when an element might be removed during the traversal, otherwise
elements will be missed.  Here is an example of how to use the macro:

     edge e;
     edge_iterator ei;

     FOR_EACH_EDGE (e, ei, bb->succs)
       {
          if (e->flags & EDGE_FALLTHRU)
            break;
       }

 There are various reasons why control flow may transfer from one block
to another.  One possibility is that some instruction, for example a
'CODE_LABEL', in a linearized instruction stream just always starts a
new basic block.  In this case a "fall-thru" edge links the basic block
to the first following basic block.  But there are several other reasons
why edges may be created.  The 'flags' field of the 'edge' data type is
used to store information about the type of edge we are dealing with.
Each edge is of one of the following types:

_jump_
     No type flags are set for edges corresponding to jump instructions.
     These edges are used for unconditional or conditional jumps and in
     RTL also for table jumps.  They are the easiest to manipulate as
     they may be freely redirected when the flow graph is not in SSA
     form.

_fall-thru_
     Fall-thru edges are present in case where the basic block may
     continue execution to the following one without branching.  These
     edges have the 'EDGE_FALLTHRU' flag set.  Unlike other types of
     edges, these edges must come into the basic block immediately
     following in the instruction stream.  The function
     'force_nonfallthru' is available to insert an unconditional jump in
     the case that redirection is needed.  Note that this may require
     creation of a new basic block.

_exception handling_
     Exception handling edges represent possible control transfers from
     a trapping instruction to an exception handler.  The definition of
     "trapping" varies.  In C++, only function calls can throw, but for
     Java and Ada, exceptions like division by zero or segmentation
     fault are defined and thus each instruction possibly throwing this
     kind of exception needs to be handled as control flow instruction.
     Exception edges have the 'EDGE_ABNORMAL' and 'EDGE_EH' flags set.

     When updating the instruction stream it is easy to change possibly
     trapping instruction to non-trapping, by simply removing the
     exception edge.  The opposite conversion is difficult, but should
     not happen anyway.  The edges can be eliminated via
     'purge_dead_edges' call.

     In the RTL representation, the destination of an exception edge is
     specified by 'REG_EH_REGION' note attached to the insn.  In case of
     a trapping call the 'EDGE_ABNORMAL_CALL' flag is set too.  In the
     'GIMPLE' representation, this extra flag is not set.

     In the RTL representation, the predicate 'may_trap_p' may be used
     to check whether instruction still may trap or not.  For the tree
     representation, the 'tree_could_trap_p' predicate is available, but
     this predicate only checks for possible memory traps, as in
     dereferencing an invalid pointer location.

_sibling calls_
     Sibling calls or tail calls terminate the function in a
     non-standard way and thus an edge to the exit must be present.
     'EDGE_SIBCALL' and 'EDGE_ABNORMAL' are set in such case.  These
     edges only exist in the RTL representation.

_computed jumps_
     Computed jumps contain edges to all labels in the function
     referenced from the code.  All those edges have 'EDGE_ABNORMAL'
     flag set.  The edges used to represent computed jumps often cause
     compile time performance problems, since functions consisting of
     many taken labels and many computed jumps may have _very_ dense
     flow graphs, so these edges need to be handled with special care.
     During the earlier stages of the compilation process, GCC tries to
     avoid such dense flow graphs by factoring computed jumps.  For
     example, given the following series of jumps,

            goto *x;
            [ ... ]

            goto *x;
            [ ... ]

            goto *x;
            [ ... ]

     factoring the computed jumps results in the following code sequence
     which has a much simpler flow graph:

            goto y;
            [ ... ]

            goto y;
            [ ... ]

            goto y;
            [ ... ]

          y:
            goto *x;

     However, the classic problem with this transformation is that it
     has a runtime cost in there resulting code: An extra jump.
     Therefore, the computed jumps are un-factored in the later passes
     of the compiler (in the pass called
     'pass_duplicate_computed_gotos').  Be aware of that when you work
     on passes in that area.  There have been numerous examples already
     where the compile time for code with unfactored computed jumps
     caused some serious headaches.

_nonlocal goto handlers_
     GCC allows nested functions to return into caller using a 'goto' to
     a label passed to as an argument to the callee.  The labels passed
     to nested functions contain special code to cleanup after function
     call.  Such sections of code are referred to as "nonlocal goto
     receivers".  If a function contains such nonlocal goto receivers,
     an edge from the call to the label is created with the
     'EDGE_ABNORMAL' and 'EDGE_ABNORMAL_CALL' flags set.

_function entry points_
     By definition, execution of function starts at basic block 0, so
     there is always an edge from the 'ENTRY_BLOCK_PTR' to basic block
     0.  There is no 'GIMPLE' representation for alternate entry points
     at this moment.  In RTL, alternate entry points are specified by
     'CODE_LABEL' with 'LABEL_ALTERNATE_NAME' defined.  This feature is
     currently used for multiple entry point prologues and is limited to
     post-reload passes only.  This can be used by back-ends to emit
     alternate prologues for functions called from different contexts.
     In future full support for multiple entry functions defined by
     Fortran 90 needs to be implemented.

_function exits_
     In the pre-reload representation a function terminates after the
     last instruction in the insn chain and no explicit return
     instructions are used.  This corresponds to the fall-thru edge into
     exit block.  After reload, optimal RTL epilogues are used that use
     explicit (conditional) return instructions that are represented by
     edges with no flags set.

14.3 Profile information
========================

In many cases a compiler must make a choice whether to trade speed in
one part of code for speed in another, or to trade code size for code
speed.  In such cases it is useful to know information about how often
some given block will be executed.  That is the purpose for maintaining
profile within the flow graph.  GCC can handle profile information
obtained through "profile feedback", but it can also estimate branch
probabilities based on statics and heuristics.

 The feedback based profile is produced by compiling the program with
instrumentation, executing it on a train run and reading the numbers of
executions of basic blocks and edges back to the compiler while
re-compiling the program to produce the final executable.  This method
provides very accurate information about where a program spends most of
its time on the train run.  Whether it matches the average run of course
depends on the choice of train data set, but several studies have shown
that the behavior of a program usually changes just marginally over
different data sets.

 When profile feedback is not available, the compiler may be asked to
attempt to predict the behavior of each branch in the program using a
set of heuristics (see 'predict.def' for details) and compute estimated
frequencies of each basic block by propagating the probabilities over
the graph.

 Each 'basic_block' contains two integer fields to represent profile
information: 'frequency' and 'count'.  The 'frequency' is an estimation
how often is basic block executed within a function.  It is represented
as an integer scaled in the range from 0 to 'BB_FREQ_BASE'.  The most
frequently executed basic block in function is initially set to
'BB_FREQ_BASE' and the rest of frequencies are scaled accordingly.
During optimization, the frequency of the most frequent basic block can
both decrease (for instance by loop unrolling) or grow (for instance by
cross-jumping optimization), so scaling sometimes has to be performed
multiple times.

 The 'count' contains hard-counted numbers of execution measured during
training runs and is nonzero only when profile feedback is available.
This value is represented as the host's widest integer (typically a 64
bit integer) of the special type 'gcov_type'.

 Most optimization passes can use only the frequency information of a
basic block, but a few passes may want to know hard execution counts.
The frequencies should always match the counts after scaling, however
during updating of the profile information numerical error may
accumulate into quite large errors.

 Each edge also contains a branch probability field: an integer in the
range from 0 to 'REG_BR_PROB_BASE'.  It represents probability of
passing control from the end of the 'src' basic block to the 'dest'
basic block, i.e. the probability that control will flow along this
edge.  The 'EDGE_FREQUENCY' macro is available to compute how frequently
a given edge is taken.  There is a 'count' field for each edge as well,
representing same information as for a basic block.

 The basic block frequencies are not represented in the instruction
stream, but in the RTL representation the edge frequencies are
represented for conditional jumps (via the 'REG_BR_PROB' macro) since
they are used when instructions are output to the assembly file and the
flow graph is no longer maintained.

 The probability that control flow arrives via a given edge to its
destination basic block is called "reverse probability" and is not
directly represented, but it may be easily computed from frequencies of
basic blocks.

 Updating profile information is a delicate task that can unfortunately
not be easily integrated with the CFG manipulation API.  Many of the
functions and hooks to modify the CFG, such as
'redirect_edge_and_branch', do not have enough information to easily
update the profile, so updating it is in the majority of cases left up
to the caller.  It is difficult to uncover bugs in the profile updating
code, because they manifest themselves only by producing worse code, and
checking profile consistency is not possible because of numeric error
accumulation.  Hence special attention needs to be given to this issue
in each pass that modifies the CFG.

 It is important to point out that 'REG_BR_PROB_BASE' and 'BB_FREQ_BASE'
are both set low enough to be possible to compute second power of any
frequency or probability in the flow graph, it is not possible to even
square the 'count' field, as modern CPUs are fast enough to execute
$2^32$ operations quickly.

14.4 Maintaining the CFG
========================

An important task of each compiler pass is to keep both the control flow
graph and all profile information up-to-date.  Reconstruction of the
control flow graph after each pass is not an option, since it may be
very expensive and lost profile information cannot be reconstructed at
all.

 GCC has two major intermediate representations, and both use the
'basic_block' and 'edge' data types to represent control flow.  Both
representations share as much of the CFG maintenance code as possible.
For each representation, a set of "hooks" is defined so that each
representation can provide its own implementation of CFG manipulation
routines when necessary.  These hooks are defined in 'cfghooks.h'.
There are hooks for almost all common CFG manipulations, including block
splitting and merging, edge redirection and creating and deleting basic
blocks.  These hooks should provide everything you need to maintain and
manipulate the CFG in both the RTL and 'GIMPLE' representation.

 At the moment, the basic block boundaries are maintained transparently
when modifying instructions, so there rarely is a need to move them
manually (such as in case someone wants to output instruction outside
basic block explicitly).

 In the RTL representation, each instruction has a 'BLOCK_FOR_INSN'
value that represents pointer to the basic block that contains the
instruction.  In the 'GIMPLE' representation, the function 'gimple_bb'
returns a pointer to the basic block containing the queried statement.

 When changes need to be applied to a function in its 'GIMPLE'
representation, "GIMPLE statement iterators" should be used.  These
iterators provide an integrated abstraction of the flow graph and the
instruction stream.  Block statement iterators are constructed using the
'gimple_stmt_iterator' data structure and several modifier are
available, including the following:

'gsi_start'
     This function initializes a 'gimple_stmt_iterator' that points to
     the first non-empty statement in a basic block.

'gsi_last'
     This function initializes a 'gimple_stmt_iterator' that points to
     the last statement in a basic block.

'gsi_end_p'
     This predicate is 'true' if a 'gimple_stmt_iterator' represents the
     end of a basic block.

'gsi_next'
     This function takes a 'gimple_stmt_iterator' and makes it point to
     its successor.

'gsi_prev'
     This function takes a 'gimple_stmt_iterator' and makes it point to
     its predecessor.

'gsi_insert_after'
     This function inserts a statement after the 'gimple_stmt_iterator'
     passed in.  The final parameter determines whether the statement
     iterator is updated to point to the newly inserted statement, or
     left pointing to the original statement.

'gsi_insert_before'
     This function inserts a statement before the 'gimple_stmt_iterator'
     passed in.  The final parameter determines whether the statement
     iterator is updated to point to the newly inserted statement, or
     left pointing to the original statement.

'gsi_remove'
     This function removes the 'gimple_stmt_iterator' passed in and
     rechains the remaining statements in a basic block, if any.

 In the RTL representation, the macros 'BB_HEAD' and 'BB_END' may be
used to get the head and end 'rtx' of a basic block.  No abstract
iterators are defined for traversing the insn chain, but you can just
use 'NEXT_INSN' and 'PREV_INSN' instead.  *Note Insns::.

 Usually a code manipulating pass simplifies the instruction stream and
the flow of control, possibly eliminating some edges.  This may for
example happen when a conditional jump is replaced with an unconditional
jump, but also when simplifying possibly trapping instruction to
non-trapping while compiling Java.  Updating of edges is not transparent
and each optimization pass is required to do so manually.  However only
few cases occur in practice.  The pass may call 'purge_dead_edges' on a
given basic block to remove superfluous edges, if any.

 Another common scenario is redirection of branch instructions, but this
is best modeled as redirection of edges in the control flow graph and
thus use of 'redirect_edge_and_branch' is preferred over more low level
functions, such as 'redirect_jump' that operate on RTL chain only.  The
CFG hooks defined in 'cfghooks.h' should provide the complete API
required for manipulating and maintaining the CFG.

 It is also possible that a pass has to insert control flow instruction
into the middle of a basic block, thus creating an entry point in the
middle of the basic block, which is impossible by definition: The block
must be split to make sure it only has one entry point, i.e. the head of
the basic block.  The CFG hook 'split_block' may be used when an
instruction in the middle of a basic block has to become the target of a
jump or branch instruction.

 For a global optimizer, a common operation is to split edges in the
flow graph and insert instructions on them.  In the RTL representation,
this can be easily done using the 'insert_insn_on_edge' function that
emits an instruction "on the edge", caching it for a later
'commit_edge_insertions' call that will take care of moving the inserted
instructions off the edge into the instruction stream contained in a
basic block.  This includes the creation of new basic blocks where
needed.  In the 'GIMPLE' representation, the equivalent functions are
'gsi_insert_on_edge' which inserts a block statement iterator on an
edge, and 'gsi_commit_edge_inserts' which flushes the instruction to
actual instruction stream.

 While debugging the optimization pass, the 'verify_flow_info' function
may be useful to find bugs in the control flow graph updating code.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Liveness information,  Prev: Maintaining the CFG,  Up: Control Flow

14.5 Liveness information
=========================

Liveness information is useful to determine whether some register is
"live" at given point of program, i.e. that it contains a value that may
be used at a later point in the program.  This information is used, for
instance, during register allocation, as the pseudo registers only need
to be assigned to a unique hard register or to a stack slot if they are
live.  The hard registers and stack slots may be freely reused for other
values when a register is dead.

 Liveness information is available in the back end starting with
'pass_df_initialize' and ending with 'pass_df_finish'.  Three flavors of
live analysis are available: With 'LR', it is possible to determine at
any point 'P' in the function if the register may be used on some path
from 'P' to the end of the function.  With 'UR', it is possible to
determine if there is a path from the beginning of the function to 'P'
that defines the variable.  'LIVE' is the intersection of the 'LR' and
'UR' and a variable is live at 'P' if there is both an assignment that
reaches it from the beginning of the function and a use that can be
reached on some path from 'P' to the end of the function.

 In general 'LIVE' is the most useful of the three.  The macros
'DF_[LR,UR,LIVE]_[IN,OUT]' can be used to access this information.  The
macros take a basic block number and return a bitmap that is indexed by
the register number.  This information is only guaranteed to be up to
date after calls are made to 'df_analyze'.  See the file 'df-core.c' for
details on using the dataflow.

 The liveness information is stored partly in the RTL instruction stream
and partly in the flow graph.  Local information is stored in the
instruction stream: Each instruction may contain 'REG_DEAD' notes
representing that the value of a given register is no longer needed, or
'REG_UNUSED' notes representing that the value computed by the
instruction is never used.  The second is useful for instructions
computing multiple values at once.

15.1 Loop representation
========================

This chapter describes the representation of loops in GCC, and functions
that can be used to build, modify and analyze this representation.  Most
of the interfaces and data structures are declared in 'cfgloop.h'.  Loop
structures are analyzed and this information disposed or updated at the
discretion of individual passes.  Still most of the generic CFG
manipulation routines are aware of loop structures and try to keep them
up-to-date.  By this means an increasing part of the compilation
pipeline is setup to maintain loop structure across passes to allow
attaching meta information to individual loops for consumption by later
passes.

 In general, a natural loop has one entry block (header) and possibly
several back edges (latches) leading to the header from the inside of
the loop.  Loops with several latches may appear if several loops share
a single header, or if there is a branching in the middle of the loop.
The representation of loops in GCC however allows only loops with a
single latch.  During loop analysis, headers of such loops are split and
forwarder blocks are created in order to disambiguate their structures.
Heuristic based on profile information and structure of the induction
variables in the loops is used to determine whether the latches
correspond to sub-loops or to control flow in a single loop.  This means
that the analysis sometimes changes the CFG, and if you run it in the
middle of an optimization pass, you must be able to deal with the new
blocks.  You may avoid CFG changes by passing
'LOOPS_MAY_HAVE_MULTIPLE_LATCHES' flag to the loop discovery, note
however that most other loop manipulation functions will not work
correctly for loops with multiple latch edges (the functions that only
query membership of blocks to loops and subloop relationships, or
enumerate and test loop exits, can be expected to work).

 Body of the loop is the set of blocks that are dominated by its header,
and reachable from its latch against the direction of edges in CFG.  The
loops are organized in a containment hierarchy (tree) such that all the
loops immediately contained inside loop L are the children of L in the
tree.  This tree is represented by the 'struct loops' structure.  The
root of this tree is a fake loop that contains all blocks in the
function.  Each of the loops is represented in a 'struct loop'
structure.  Each loop is assigned an index ('num' field of the 'struct
loop' structure), and the pointer to the loop is stored in the
corresponding field of the 'larray' vector in the loops structure.  The
indices do not have to be continuous, there may be empty ('NULL')
entries in the 'larray' created by deleting loops.  Also, there is no
guarantee on the relative order of a loop and its subloops in the
numbering.  The index of a loop never changes.

 The entries of the 'larray' field should not be accessed directly.  The
function 'get_loop' returns the loop description for a loop with the
given index.  'number_of_loops' function returns number of loops in the
function.  To traverse all loops, use 'FOR_EACH_LOOP' macro.  The
'flags' argument of the macro is used to determine the direction of
traversal and the set of loops visited.  Each loop is guaranteed to be
visited exactly once, regardless of the changes to the loop tree, and
the loops may be removed during the traversal.  The newly created loops
are never traversed, if they need to be visited, this must be done
separately after their creation.  The 'FOR_EACH_LOOP' macro allocates
temporary variables.  If the 'FOR_EACH_LOOP' loop were ended using break
or goto, they would not be released; 'FOR_EACH_LOOP_BREAK' macro must be
used instead.

 Each basic block contains the reference to the innermost loop it
belongs to ('loop_father').  For this reason, it is only possible to
have one 'struct loops' structure initialized at the same time for each
CFG.  The global variable 'current_loops' contains the 'struct loops'
structure.  Many of the loop manipulation functions assume that
dominance information is up-to-date.

 The loops are analyzed through 'loop_optimizer_init' function.  The
argument of this function is a set of flags represented in an integer
bitmask.  These flags specify what other properties of the loop
structures should be calculated/enforced and preserved later:

   * 'LOOPS_MAY_HAVE_MULTIPLE_LATCHES': If this flag is set, no changes
     to CFG will be performed in the loop analysis, in particular, loops
     with multiple latch edges will not be disambiguated.  If a loop has
     multiple latches, its latch block is set to NULL.  Most of the loop
     manipulation functions will not work for loops in this shape.  No
     other flags that require CFG changes can be passed to
     loop_optimizer_init.
   * 'LOOPS_HAVE_PREHEADERS': Forwarder blocks are created in such a way
     that each loop has only one entry edge, and additionally, the
     source block of this entry edge has only one successor.  This
     creates a natural place where the code can be moved out of the
     loop, and ensures that the entry edge of the loop leads from its
     immediate super-loop.
   * 'LOOPS_HAVE_SIMPLE_LATCHES': Forwarder blocks are created to force
     the latch block of each loop to have only one successor.  This
     ensures that the latch of the loop does not belong to any of its
     sub-loops, and makes manipulation with the loops significantly
     easier.  Most of the loop manipulation functions assume that the
     loops are in this shape.  Note that with this flag, the "normal"
     loop without any control flow inside and with one exit consists of
     two basic blocks.
   * 'LOOPS_HAVE_MARKED_IRREDUCIBLE_REGIONS': Basic blocks and edges in
     the strongly connected components that are not natural loops (have
     more than one entry block) are marked with 'BB_IRREDUCIBLE_LOOP'
     and 'EDGE_IRREDUCIBLE_LOOP' flags.  The flag is not set for blocks
     and edges that belong to natural loops that are in such an
     irreducible region (but it is set for the entry and exit edges of
     such a loop, if they lead to/from this region).
   * 'LOOPS_HAVE_RECORDED_EXITS': The lists of exits are recorded and
     updated for each loop.  This makes some functions (e.g.,
     'get_loop_exit_edges') more efficient.  Some functions (e.g.,
     'single_exit') can be used only if the lists of exits are recorded.

 These properties may also be computed/enforced later, using functions
'create_preheaders', 'force_single_succ_latches',
'mark_irreducible_loops' and 'record_loop_exits'.  The properties can be
queried using 'loops_state_satisfies_p'.

 The memory occupied by the loops structures should be freed with
'loop_optimizer_finalize' function.  When loop structures are setup to
be preserved across passes this function reduces the information to be
kept up-to-date to a minimum (only 'LOOPS_MAY_HAVE_MULTIPLE_LATCHES'
set).

 The CFG manipulation functions in general do not update loop
structures.  Specialized versions that additionally do so are provided
for the most common tasks.  On GIMPLE, 'cleanup_tree_cfg_loop' function
can be used to cleanup CFG while updating the loops structures if
'current_loops' is set.

 At the moment loop structure is preserved from the start of GIMPLE loop
optimizations until the end of RTL loop optimizations.  During this time
a loop can be tracked by its 'struct loop' and number.

15.2 Loop querying
==================

The functions to query the information about loops are declared in
'cfgloop.h'.  Some of the information can be taken directly from the
structures.  'loop_father' field of each basic block contains the
innermost loop to that the block belongs.  The most useful fields of
loop structure (that are kept up-to-date at all times) are:

   * 'header', 'latch': Header and latch basic blocks of the loop.
   * 'num_nodes': Number of basic blocks in the loop (including the
     basic blocks of the sub-loops).
   * 'depth': The depth of the loop in the loops tree, i.e., the number
     of super-loops of the loop.
   * 'outer', 'inner', 'next': The super-loop, the first sub-loop, and
     the sibling of the loop in the loops tree.

 There are other fields in the loop structures, many of them used only
by some of the passes, or not updated during CFG changes; in general,
they should not be accessed directly.

 The most important functions to query loop structures are:

   * 'flow_loops_dump': Dumps the information about loops to a file.
   * 'verify_loop_structure': Checks consistency of the loop structures.
   * 'loop_latch_edge': Returns the latch edge of a loop.
   * 'loop_preheader_edge': If loops have preheaders, returns the
     preheader edge of a loop.
   * 'flow_loop_nested_p': Tests whether loop is a sub-loop of another
     loop.
   * 'flow_bb_inside_loop_p': Tests whether a basic block belongs to a
     loop (including its sub-loops).
   * 'find_common_loop': Finds the common super-loop of two loops.
   * 'superloop_at_depth': Returns the super-loop of a loop with the
     given depth.
   * 'tree_num_loop_insns', 'num_loop_insns': Estimates the number of
     insns in the loop, on GIMPLE and on RTL.
   * 'loop_exit_edge_p': Tests whether edge is an exit from a loop.
   * 'mark_loop_exit_edges': Marks all exit edges of all loops with
     'EDGE_LOOP_EXIT' flag.
   * 'get_loop_body', 'get_loop_body_in_dom_order',
     'get_loop_body_in_bfs_order': Enumerates the basic blocks in the
     loop in depth-first search order in reversed CFG, ordered by
     dominance relation, and breath-first search order, respectively.
   * 'single_exit': Returns the single exit edge of the loop, or 'NULL'
     if the loop has more than one exit.  You can only use this function
     if LOOPS_HAVE_MARKED_SINGLE_EXITS property is used.
   * 'get_loop_exit_edges': Enumerates the exit edges of a loop.
   * 'just_once_each_iteration_p': Returns true if the basic block is
     executed exactly once during each iteration of a loop (that is, it
     does not belong to a sub-loop, and it dominates the latch of the
     loop).


File: gccint.info,  Node: Loop manipulation,  Next: LCSSA,  Prev: Loop querying,  Up: Loop Analysis and Representation

15.3 Loop manipulation
======================

The loops tree can be manipulated using the following functions:

   * 'flow_loop_tree_node_add': Adds a node to the tree.
   * 'flow_loop_tree_node_remove': Removes a node from the tree.
   * 'add_bb_to_loop': Adds a basic block to a loop.
   * 'remove_bb_from_loops': Removes a basic block from loops.

 Most low-level CFG functions update loops automatically.  The following
functions handle some more complicated cases of CFG manipulations:

   * 'remove_path': Removes an edge and all blocks it dominates.
   * 'split_loop_exit_edge': Splits exit edge of the loop, ensuring that
     PHI node arguments remain in the loop (this ensures that
     loop-closed SSA form is preserved).  Only useful on GIMPLE.

 Finally, there are some higher-level loop transformations implemented.
While some of them are written so that they should work on non-innermost
loops, they are mostly untested in that case, and at the moment, they
are only reliable for the innermost loops:

   * 'create_iv': Creates a new induction variable.  Only works on
     GIMPLE.  'standard_iv_increment_position' can be used to find a
     suitable place for the iv increment.
   * 'duplicate_loop_to_header_edge',
     'tree_duplicate_loop_to_header_edge': These functions (on RTL and
     on GIMPLE) duplicate the body of the loop prescribed number of
     times on one of the edges entering loop header, thus performing
     either loop unrolling or loop peeling.  'can_duplicate_loop_p'
     ('can_unroll_loop_p' on GIMPLE) must be true for the duplicated
     loop.
   * 'loop_version', 'tree_ssa_loop_version': These function create a
     copy of a loop, and a branch before them that selects one of them
     depending on the prescribed condition.  This is useful for
     optimizations that need to verify some assumptions in runtime (one
     of the copies of the loop is usually left unchanged, while the
     other one is transformed in some way).
   * 'tree_unroll_loop': Unrolls the loop, including peeling the extra
     iterations to make the number of iterations divisible by unroll
     factor, updating the exit condition, and removing the exits that
     now cannot be taken.  Works only on GIMPLE.

15.4 Loop-closed SSA form
=========================

Throughout the loop optimizations on tree level, one extra condition is
enforced on the SSA form: No SSA name is used outside of the loop in
that it is defined.  The SSA form satisfying this condition is called
"loop-closed SSA form" - LCSSA.  To enforce LCSSA, PHI nodes must be
created at the exits of the loops for the SSA names that are used
outside of them.  Only the real operands (not virtual SSA names) are
held in LCSSA, in order to save memory.

 There are various benefits of LCSSA:

   * Many optimizations (value range analysis, final value replacement)
     are interested in the values that are defined in the loop and used
     outside of it, i.e., exactly those for that we create new PHI
     nodes.
   * In induction variable analysis, it is not necessary to specify the
     loop in that the analysis should be performed - the scalar
     evolution analysis always returns the results with respect to the
     loop in that the SSA name is defined.
   * It makes updating of SSA form during loop transformations simpler.
     Without LCSSA, operations like loop unrolling may force creation of
     PHI nodes arbitrarily far from the loop, while in LCSSA, the SSA
     form can be updated locally.  However, since we only keep real
     operands in LCSSA, we cannot use this advantage (we could have
     local updating of real operands, but it is not much more efficient
     than to use generic SSA form updating for it as well; the amount of
     changes to SSA is the same).

 However, it also means LCSSA must be updated.  This is usually
straightforward, unless you create a new value in loop and use it
outside, or unless you manipulate loop exit edges (functions are
provided to make these manipulations simple).
'rewrite_into_loop_closed_ssa' is used to rewrite SSA form to LCSSA, and
'verify_loop_closed_ssa' to check that the invariant of LCSSA is
preserved.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Scalar evolutions,  Next: loop-iv,  Prev: LCSSA,  Up: Loop Analysis and Representation

15.5 Scalar evolutions
======================

Scalar evolutions (SCEV) are used to represent results of induction
variable analysis on GIMPLE.  They enable us to represent variables with
complicated behavior in a simple and consistent way (we only use it to
express values of polynomial induction variables, but it is possible to
extend it).  The interfaces to SCEV analysis are declared in
'tree-scalar-evolution.h'.  To use scalar evolutions analysis,
'scev_initialize' must be used.  To stop using SCEV, 'scev_finalize'
should be used.  SCEV analysis caches results in order to save time and
memory.  This cache however is made invalid by most of the loop
transformations, including removal of code.  If such a transformation is
performed, 'scev_reset' must be called to clean the caches.

 Given an SSA name, its behavior in loops can be analyzed using the
'analyze_scalar_evolution' function.  The returned SCEV however does not
have to be fully analyzed and it may contain references to other SSA
names defined in the loop.  To resolve these (potentially recursive)
references, 'instantiate_parameters' or 'resolve_mixers' functions must
be used.  'instantiate_parameters' is useful when you use the results of
SCEV only for some analysis, and when you work with whole nest of loops
at once.  It will try replacing all SSA names by their SCEV in all
loops, including the super-loops of the current loop, thus providing a
complete information about the behavior of the variable in the loop
nest.  'resolve_mixers' is useful if you work with only one loop at a
time, and if you possibly need to create code based on the value of the
induction variable.  It will only resolve the SSA names defined in the
current loop, leaving the SSA names defined outside unchanged, even if
their evolution in the outer loops is known.

 The SCEV is a normal tree expression, except for the fact that it may
contain several special tree nodes.  One of them is 'SCEV_NOT_KNOWN',
used for SSA names whose value cannot be expressed.  The other one is
'POLYNOMIAL_CHREC'.  Polynomial chrec has three arguments - base, step
and loop (both base and step may contain further polynomial chrecs).
Type of the expression and of base and step must be the same.  A
variable has evolution 'POLYNOMIAL_CHREC(base, step, loop)' if it is (in
the specified loop) equivalent to 'x_1' in the following example

     while (...)
       {
         x_1 = phi (base, x_2);
         x_2 = x_1 + step;
       }

 Note that this includes the language restrictions on the operations.
For example, if we compile C code and 'x' has signed type, then the
overflow in addition would cause undefined behavior, and we may assume
that this does not happen.  Hence, the value with this SCEV cannot
overflow (which restricts the number of iterations of such a loop).

 In many cases, one wants to restrict the attention just to affine
induction variables.  In this case, the extra expressive power of SCEV
is not useful, and may complicate the optimizations.  In this case,
'simple_iv' function may be used to analyze a value - the result is a
loop-invariant base and step.

15.6 IV analysis on RTL
=======================

The induction variable on RTL is simple and only allows analysis of
affine induction variables, and only in one loop at once.  The interface
is declared in 'cfgloop.h'.  Before analyzing induction variables in a
loop L, 'iv_analysis_loop_init' function must be called on L. After the
analysis (possibly calling 'iv_analysis_loop_init' for several loops) is
finished, 'iv_analysis_done' should be called.  The following functions
can be used to access the results of the analysis:

   * 'iv_analyze': Analyzes a single register used in the given insn.
     If no use of the register in this insn is found, the following
     insns are scanned, so that this function can be called on the insn
     returned by get_condition.
   * 'iv_analyze_result': Analyzes result of the assignment in the given
     insn.
   * 'iv_analyze_expr': Analyzes a more complicated expression.  All its
     operands are analyzed by 'iv_analyze', and hence they must be used
     in the specified insn or one of the following insns.

 The description of the induction variable is provided in 'struct
rtx_iv'.  In order to handle subregs, the representation is a bit
complicated; if the value of the 'extend' field is not 'UNKNOWN', the
value of the induction variable in the i-th iteration is

     delta + mult * extend_{extend_mode} (subreg_{mode} (base + i * step)),

 with the following exception: if 'first_special' is true, then the
value in the first iteration (when 'i' is zero) is 'delta + mult *
base'.  However, if 'extend' is equal to 'UNKNOWN', then 'first_special'
must be false, 'delta' 0, 'mult' 1 and the value in the i-th iteration
is

     subreg_{mode} (base + i * step)

 The function 'get_iv_value' can be used to perform these calculations.

15.7 Number of iterations analysis
==================================

Both on GIMPLE and on RTL, there are functions available to determine
the number of iterations of a loop, with a similar interface.  The
number of iterations of a loop in GCC is defined as the number of
executions of the loop latch.  In many cases, it is not possible to
determine the number of iterations unconditionally - the determined
number is correct only if some assumptions are satisfied.  The analysis
tries to verify these conditions using the information contained in the
program; if it fails, the conditions are returned together with the
result.  The following information and conditions are provided by the
analysis:

   * 'assumptions': If this condition is false, the rest of the
     information is invalid.
   * 'noloop_assumptions' on RTL, 'may_be_zero' on GIMPLE: If this
     condition is true, the loop exits in the first iteration.
   * 'infinite': If this condition is true, the loop is infinite.  This
     condition is only available on RTL.  On GIMPLE, conditions for
     finiteness of the loop are included in 'assumptions'.
   * 'niter_expr' on RTL, 'niter' on GIMPLE: The expression that gives
     number of iterations.  The number of iterations is defined as the
     number of executions of the loop latch.

 Both on GIMPLE and on RTL, it necessary for the induction variable
analysis framework to be initialized (SCEV on GIMPLE, loop-iv on RTL).
On GIMPLE, the results are stored to 'struct tree_niter_desc' structure.
Number of iterations before the loop is exited through a given exit can
be determined using 'number_of_iterations_exit' function.  On RTL, the
results are returned in 'struct niter_desc' structure.  The
corresponding function is named 'check_simple_exit'.  There are also
functions that pass through all the exits of a loop and try to find one
with easy to determine number of iterations - 'find_loop_niter' on
GIMPLE and 'find_simple_exit' on RTL.  Finally, there are functions that
provide the same information, but additionally cache it, so that
repeated calls to number of iterations are not so costly -
'number_of_latch_executions' on GIMPLE and 'get_simple_loop_desc' on
RTL.

 Note that some of these functions may behave slightly differently than
others - some of them return only the expression for the number of
iterations, and fail if there are some assumptions.  The function
'number_of_latch_executions' works only for single-exit loops.  The
function 'number_of_cond_exit_executions' can be used to determine
number of executions of the exit condition of a single-exit loop (i.e.,
the 'number_of_latch_executions' increased by one).

15.8 Data Dependency Analysis
=============================

The code for the data dependence analysis can be found in
'tree-data-ref.c' and its interface and data structures are described in
'tree-data-ref.h'.  The function that computes the data dependences for
all the array and pointer references for a given loop is
'compute_data_dependences_for_loop'.  This function is currently used by
the linear loop transform and the vectorization passes.  Before calling
this function, one has to allocate two vectors: a first vector will
contain the set of data references that are contained in the analyzed
loop body, and the second vector will contain the dependence relations
between the data references.  Thus if the vector of data references is
of size 'n', the vector containing the dependence relations will contain
'n*n' elements.  However if the analyzed loop contains side effects,
such as calls that potentially can interfere with the data references in
the current analyzed loop, the analysis stops while scanning the loop
body for data references, and inserts a single 'chrec_dont_know' in the
dependence relation array.

 The data references are discovered in a particular order during the
scanning of the loop body: the loop body is analyzed in execution order,
and the data references of each statement are pushed at the end of the
data reference array.  Two data references syntactically occur in the
program in the same order as in the array of data references.  This
syntactic order is important in some classical data dependence tests,
and mapping this order to the elements of this array avoids costly
queries to the loop body representation.

 Three types of data references are currently handled: ARRAY_REF,
INDIRECT_REF and COMPONENT_REF.  The data structure for the data
reference is 'data_reference', where 'data_reference_p' is a name of a
pointer to the data reference structure.  The structure contains the
following elements:

   * 'base_object_info': Provides information about the base object of
     the data reference and its access functions.  These access
     functions represent the evolution of the data reference in the loop
     relative to its base, in keeping with the classical meaning of the
     data reference access function for the support of arrays.  For
     example, for a reference 'a.b[i][j]', the base object is 'a.b' and
     the access functions, one for each array subscript, are: '{i_init,
     + i_step}_1, {j_init, +, j_step}_2'.

   * 'first_location_in_loop': Provides information about the first
     location accessed by the data reference in the loop and about the
     access function used to represent evolution relative to this
     location.  This data is used to support pointers, and is not used
     for arrays (for which we have base objects).  Pointer accesses are
     represented as a one-dimensional access that starts from the first
     location accessed in the loop.  For example:

                for1 i
                   for2 j
                    *((int *)p + i + j) = a[i][j];

     The access function of the pointer access is '{0, + 4B}_for2'
     relative to 'p + i'.  The access functions of the array are
     '{i_init, + i_step}_for1' and '{j_init, +, j_step}_for2' relative
     to 'a'.

     Usually, the object the pointer refers to is either unknown, or we
     can't prove that the access is confined to the boundaries of a
     certain object.

     Two data references can be compared only if at least one of these
     two representations has all its fields filled for both data
     references.

     The current strategy for data dependence tests is as follows: If
     both 'a' and 'b' are represented as arrays, compare 'a.base_object'
     and 'b.base_object'; if they are equal, apply dependence tests (use
     access functions based on base_objects).  Else if both 'a' and 'b'
     are represented as pointers, compare 'a.first_location' and
     'b.first_location'; if they are equal, apply dependence tests (use
     access functions based on first location).  However, if 'a' and 'b'
     are represented differently, only try to prove that the bases are
     definitely different.

   * Aliasing information.
   * Alignment information.

 The structure describing the relation between two data references is
'data_dependence_relation' and the shorter name for a pointer to such a
structure is 'ddr_p'.  This structure contains:

   * a pointer to each data reference,
   * a tree node 'are_dependent' that is set to 'chrec_known' if the
     analysis has proved that there is no dependence between these two
     data references, 'chrec_dont_know' if the analysis was not able to
     determine any useful result and potentially there could exist a
     dependence between these data references, and 'are_dependent' is
     set to 'NULL_TREE' if there exist a dependence relation between the
     data references, and the description of this dependence relation is
     given in the 'subscripts', 'dir_vects', and 'dist_vects' arrays,
   * a boolean that determines whether the dependence relation can be
     represented by a classical distance vector,
   * an array 'subscripts' that contains a description of each subscript
     of the data references.  Given two array accesses a subscript is
     the tuple composed of the access functions for a given dimension.
     For example, given 'A[f1][f2][f3]' and 'B[g1][g2][g3]', there are
     three subscripts: '(f1, g1), (f2, g2), (f3, g3)'.
   * two arrays 'dir_vects' and 'dist_vects' that contain classical
     representations of the data dependences under the form of direction
     and distance dependence vectors,
   * an array of loops 'loop_nest' that contains the loops to which the
     distance and direction vectors refer to.

 Several functions for pretty printing the information extracted by the
data dependence analysis are available: 'dump_ddrs' prints with a
maximum verbosity the details of a data dependence relations array,
'dump_dist_dir_vectors' prints only the classical distance and direction
vectors for a data dependence relations array, and
'dump_data_references' prints the details of the data references
contained in a data reference array.

15.9 Omega a solver for linear programming problems
===================================================

The data dependence analysis contains several solvers triggered
sequentially from the less complex ones to the more sophisticated.  For
ensuring the consistency of the results of these solvers, a data
dependence check pass has been implemented based on two different
solvers.  The second method that has been integrated to GCC is based on
the Omega dependence solver, written in the 1990's by William Pugh and
David Wonnacott.  Data dependence tests can be formulated using a subset
of the Presburger arithmetics that can be translated to linear
constraint systems.  These linear constraint systems can then be solved
using the Omega solver.

 The Omega solver is using Fourier-Motzkin's algorithm for variable
elimination: a linear constraint system containing 'n' variables is
reduced to a linear constraint system with 'n-1' variables.  The Omega
solver can also be used for solving other problems that can be expressed
under the form of a system of linear equalities and inequalities.  The
Omega solver is known to have an exponential worst case, also known
under the name of "omega nightmare" in the literature, but in practice,
the omega test is known to be efficient for the common data dependence
tests.

 The interface used by the Omega solver for describing the linear
programming problems is described in 'omega.h', and the solver is
'omega_solve_problem'.

16 Machine Descriptions
***********************

A machine description has two parts: a file of instruction patterns
('.md' file) and a C header file of macro definitions.

 The '.md' file for a target machine contains a pattern for each
instruction that the target machine supports (or at least each
instruction that is worth telling the compiler about).  It may also
contain comments.  A semicolon causes the rest of the line to be a
comment, unless the semicolon is inside a quoted string.

 See the next chapter for information on the C header file.

16.1 Overview of How the Machine Description is Used
====================================================

There are three main conversions that happen in the compiler:

  1. The front end reads the source code and builds a parse tree.

  2. The parse tree is used to generate an RTL insn list based on named
     instruction patterns.

  3. The insn list is matched against the RTL templates to produce
     assembler code.

 For the generate pass, only the names of the insns matter, from either
a named 'define_insn' or a 'define_expand'.  The compiler will choose
the pattern with the right name and apply the operands according to the
documentation later in this chapter, without regard for the RTL template
or operand constraints.  Note that the names the compiler looks for are
hard-coded in the compiler--it will ignore unnamed patterns and patterns
with names it doesn't know about, but if you don't provide a named
pattern it needs, it will abort.

 If a 'define_insn' is used, the template given is inserted into the
insn list.  If a 'define_expand' is used, one of three things happens,
based on the condition logic.  The condition logic may manually create
new insns for the insn list, say via 'emit_insn()', and invoke 'DONE'.
For certain named patterns, it may invoke 'FAIL' to tell the compiler to
use an alternate way of performing that task.  If it invokes neither
'DONE' nor 'FAIL', the template given in the pattern is inserted, as if
the 'define_expand' were a 'define_insn'.

 Once the insn list is generated, various optimization passes convert,
replace, and rearrange the insns in the insn list.  This is where the
'define_split' and 'define_peephole' patterns get used, for example.

 Finally, the insn list's RTL is matched up with the RTL templates in
the 'define_insn' patterns, and those patterns are used to emit the
final assembly code.  For this purpose, each named 'define_insn' acts
like it's unnamed, since the names are ignored.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Patterns,  Next: Example,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Machine Desc

16.2 Everything about Instruction Patterns
==========================================

Each instruction pattern contains an incomplete RTL expression, with
pieces to be filled in later, operand constraints that restrict how the
pieces can be filled in, and an output pattern or C code to generate the
assembler output, all wrapped up in a 'define_insn' expression.

 A 'define_insn' is an RTL expression containing four or five operands:

  1. An optional name.  The presence of a name indicate that this
     instruction pattern can perform a certain standard job for the
     RTL-generation pass of the compiler.  This pass knows certain names
     and will use the instruction patterns with those names, if the
     names are defined in the machine description.

     The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string where
     the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never used
     for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler insns
     to be combined later on.

     Names that are not thus known and used in RTL-generation have no
     effect; they are equivalent to no name at all.

     For the purpose of debugging the compiler, you may also specify a
     name beginning with the '*' character.  Such a name is used only
     for identifying the instruction in RTL dumps; it is entirely
     equivalent to having a nameless pattern for all other purposes.

  2. The "RTL template" (*note RTL Template::) is a vector of incomplete
     RTL expressions which show what the instruction should look like.
     It is incomplete because it may contain 'match_operand',
     'match_operator', and 'match_dup' expressions that stand for
     operands of the instruction.

     If the vector has only one element, that element is the template
     for the instruction pattern.  If the vector has multiple elements,
     then the instruction pattern is a 'parallel' expression containing
     the elements described.

  3. A condition.  This is a string which contains a C expression that
     is the final test to decide whether an insn body matches this
     pattern.

     For a named pattern, the condition (if present) may not depend on
     the data in the insn being matched, but only the
     target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to test these
     conditions during initialization in order to learn exactly which
     named instructions are available in a particular run.

     For nameless patterns, the condition is applied only when matching
     an individual insn, and only after the insn has matched the
     pattern's recognition template.  The insn's operands may be found
     in the vector 'operands'.  For an insn where the condition has once
     matched, it can't be used to control register allocation, for
     example by excluding certain hard registers or hard register
     combinations.

  4. The "output template": a string that says how to output matching
     insns as assembler code.  '%' in this string specifies where to
     substitute the value of an operand.  *Note Output Template::.

     When simple substitution isn't general enough, you can specify a
     piece of C code to compute the output.  *Note Output Statement::.

  5. Optionally, a vector containing the values of attributes for insns
     matching this pattern.  *Note Insn Attributes::.

16.3 Example of 'define_insn'
=============================

Here is an actual example of an instruction pattern, for the
68000/68020.

     (define_insn "tstsi"
       [(set (cc0)
             (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
       ""
       "*
     {
       if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
         return \"tstl %0\";
       return \"cmpl #0,%0\";
     }")

This can also be written using braced strings:

     (define_insn "tstsi"
       [(set (cc0)
             (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
       ""
     {
       if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
         return "tstl %0";
       return "cmpl #0,%0";
     })

 This is an instruction that sets the condition codes based on the value
of a general operand.  It has no condition, so any insn whose RTL
description has the form shown may be handled according to this pattern.
The name 'tstsi' means "test a 'SImode' value" and tells the RTL
generation pass that, when it is necessary to test such a value, an insn
to do so can be constructed using this pattern.

 The output control string is a piece of C code which chooses which
output template to return based on the kind of operand and the specific
type of CPU for which code is being generated.

 '"rm"' is an operand constraint.  Its meaning is explained below.

16.4 RTL Template
=================

The RTL template is used to define which insns match the particular
pattern and how to find their operands.  For named patterns, the RTL
template also says how to construct an insn from specified operands.

 Construction involves substituting specified operands into a copy of
the template.  Matching involves determining the values that serve as
the operands in the insn being matched.  Both of these activities are
controlled by special expression types that direct matching and
substitution of the operands.

'(match_operand:M N PREDICATE CONSTRAINT)'
     This expression is a placeholder for operand number N of the insn.
     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted at
     this point.  When matching an insn, whatever appears at this
     position in the insn will be taken as operand number N; but it must
     satisfy PREDICATE or this instruction pattern will not match at
     all.

     Operand numbers must be chosen consecutively counting from zero in
     each instruction pattern.  There may be only one 'match_operand'
     expression in the pattern for each operand number.  Usually
     operands are numbered in the order of appearance in 'match_operand'
     expressions.  In the case of a 'define_expand', any operand numbers
     used only in 'match_dup' expressions have higher values than all
     other operand numbers.

     PREDICATE is a string that is the name of a function that accepts
     two arguments, an expression and a machine mode.  *Note
     Predicates::.  During matching, the function will be called with
     the putative operand as the expression and M as the mode argument
     (if M is not specified, 'VOIDmode' will be used, which normally
     causes PREDICATE to accept any mode).  If it returns zero, this
     instruction pattern fails to match.  PREDICATE may be an empty
     string; then it means no test is to be done on the operand, so
     anything which occurs in this position is valid.

     Most of the time, PREDICATE will reject modes other than M--but not
     always.  For example, the predicate 'address_operand' uses M as the
     mode of memory ref that the address should be valid for.  Many
     predicates accept 'const_int' nodes even though their mode is
     'VOIDmode'.

     CONSTRAINT controls reloading and the choice of the best register
     class to use for a value, as explained later (*note Constraints::).
     If the constraint would be an empty string, it can be omitted.

     People are often unclear on the difference between the constraint
     and the predicate.  The predicate helps decide whether a given insn
     matches the pattern.  The constraint plays no role in this
     decision; instead, it controls various decisions in the case of an
     insn which does match.

'(match_scratch:M N CONSTRAINT)'
     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N and
     indicates that operand must be a 'scratch' or 'reg' expression.

     When matching patterns, this is equivalent to

          (match_operand:M N "scratch_operand" PRED)

     but, when generating RTL, it produces a ('scratch':M) expression.

     If the last few expressions in a 'parallel' are 'clobber'
     expressions whose operands are either a hard register or
     'match_scratch', the combiner can add or delete them when
     necessary.  *Note Side Effects::.

'(match_dup N)'
     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N.  It is
     used when the operand needs to appear more than once in the insn.

     In construction, 'match_dup' acts just like 'match_operand': the
     operand is substituted into the insn being constructed.  But in
     matching, 'match_dup' behaves differently.  It assumes that operand
     number N has already been determined by a 'match_operand' appearing
     earlier in the recognition template, and it matches only an
     identical-looking expression.

     Note that 'match_dup' should not be used to tell the compiler that
     a particular register is being used for two operands (example:
     'add' that adds one register to another; the second register is
     both an input operand and the output operand).  Use a matching
     constraint (*note Simple Constraints::) for those.  'match_dup' is
     for the cases where one operand is used in two places in the
     template, such as an instruction that computes both a quotient and
     a remainder, where the opcode takes two input operands but the RTL
     template has to refer to each of those twice; once for the quotient
     pattern and once for the remainder pattern.

'(match_operator:M N PREDICATE [OPERANDS...])'
     This pattern is a kind of placeholder for a variable RTL expression
     code.

     When constructing an insn, it stands for an RTL expression whose
     expression code is taken from that of operand N, and whose operands
     are constructed from the patterns OPERANDS.

     When matching an expression, it matches an expression if the
     function PREDICATE returns nonzero on that expression _and_ the
     patterns OPERANDS match the operands of the expression.

     Suppose that the function 'commutative_operator' is defined as
     follows, to match any expression whose operator is one of the
     commutative arithmetic operators of RTL and whose mode is MODE:

          int
          commutative_integer_operator (x, mode)
               rtx x;
               enum machine_mode mode;
          {
            enum rtx_code code = GET_CODE (x);
            if (GET_MODE (x) != mode)
              return 0;
            return (GET_RTX_CLASS (code) == RTX_COMM_ARITH
                    || code == EQ || code == NE);
          }

     Then the following pattern will match any RTL expression consisting
     of a commutative operator applied to two general operands:

          (match_operator:SI 3 "commutative_operator"
            [(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "g")
             (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g")])

     Here the vector '[OPERANDS...]' contains two patterns because the
     expressions to be matched all contain two operands.

     When this pattern does match, the two operands of the commutative
     operator are recorded as operands 1 and 2 of the insn.  (This is
     done by the two instances of 'match_operand'.)  Operand 3 of the
     insn will be the entire commutative expression: use 'GET_CODE
     (operands[3])' to see which commutative operator was used.

     The machine mode M of 'match_operator' works like that of
     'match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

     When constructing an insn, argument 3 of the gen-function will
     specify the operation (i.e. the expression code) for the expression
     to be made.  It should be an RTL expression, whose expression code
     is copied into a new expression whose operands are arguments 1 and
     2 of the gen-function.  The subexpressions of argument 3 are not
     used; only its expression code matters.

     When 'match_operator' is used in a pattern for matching an insn, it
     usually best if the operand number of the 'match_operator' is
     higher than that of the actual operands of the insn.  This improves
     register allocation because the register allocator often looks at
     operands 1 and 2 of insns to see if it can do register tying.

     There is no way to specify constraints in 'match_operator'.  The
     operand of the insn which corresponds to the 'match_operator' never
     has any constraints because it is never reloaded as a whole.
     However, if parts of its OPERANDS are matched by 'match_operand'
     patterns, those parts may have constraints of their own.

'(match_op_dup:M N[OPERANDS...])'
     Like 'match_dup', except that it applies to operators instead of
     operands.  When constructing an insn, operand number N will be
     substituted at this point.  But in matching, 'match_op_dup' behaves
     differently.  It assumes that operand number N has already been
     determined by a 'match_operator' appearing earlier in the
     recognition template, and it matches only an identical-looking
     expression.

'(match_parallel N PREDICATE [SUBPAT...])'
     This pattern is a placeholder for an insn that consists of a
     'parallel' expression with a variable number of elements.  This
     expression should only appear at the top level of an insn pattern.

     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted at
     this point.  When matching an insn, it matches if the body of the
     insn is a 'parallel' expression with at least as many elements as
     the vector of SUBPAT expressions in the 'match_parallel', if each
     SUBPAT matches the corresponding element of the 'parallel', _and_
     the function PREDICATE returns nonzero on the 'parallel' that is
     the body of the insn.  It is the responsibility of the predicate to
     validate elements of the 'parallel' beyond those listed in the
     'match_parallel'.

     A typical use of 'match_parallel' is to match load and store
     multiple expressions, which can contain a variable number of
     elements in a 'parallel'.  For example,

          (define_insn ""
            [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
               [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
                (use (reg:SI 179))
                (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
            ""
            "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

     This example comes from 'a29k.md'.  The function
     'load_multiple_operation' is defined in 'a29k.c' and checks that
     subsequent elements in the 'parallel' are the same as the 'set' in
     the pattern, except that they are referencing subsequent registers
     and memory locations.

     An insn that matches this pattern might look like:

          (parallel
           [(set (reg:SI 20) (mem:SI (reg:SI 100)))
            (use (reg:SI 179))
            (clobber (reg:SI 179))
            (set (reg:SI 21)
                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                                  (const_int 4))))
            (set (reg:SI 22)
                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                                  (const_int 8))))])

'(match_par_dup N [SUBPAT...])'
     Like 'match_op_dup', but for 'match_parallel' instead of
     'match_operator'.

16.5 Output Templates and Operand Substitution
==============================================

The "output template" is a string which specifies how to output the
assembler code for an instruction pattern.  Most of the template is a
fixed string which is output literally.  The character '%' is used to
specify where to substitute an operand; it can also be used to identify
places where different variants of the assembler require different
syntax.

 In the simplest case, a '%' followed by a digit N says to output
operand N at that point in the string.

 '%' followed by a letter and a digit says to output an operand in an
alternate fashion.  Four letters have standard, built-in meanings
described below.  The machine description macro 'PRINT_OPERAND' can
define additional letters with nonstandard meanings.

 '%cDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand that is a constant value
without the syntax that normally indicates an immediate operand.

 '%nDIGIT' is like '%cDIGIT' except that the value of the constant is
negated before printing.

 '%aDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand as if it were a memory
reference, with the actual operand treated as the address.  This may be
useful when outputting a "load address" instruction, because often the
assembler syntax for such an instruction requires you to write the
operand as if it were a memory reference.

 '%lDIGIT' is used to substitute a 'label_ref' into a jump instruction.

 '%=' outputs a number which is unique to each instruction in the entire
compilation.  This is useful for making local labels to be referred to
more than once in a single template that generates multiple assembler
instructions.

 '%' followed by a punctuation character specifies a substitution that
does not use an operand.  Only one case is standard: '%%' outputs a '%'
into the assembler code.  Other nonstandard cases can be defined in the
'PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  You must also define which punctuation
characters are valid with the 'PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' macro.

 The template may generate multiple assembler instructions.  Write the
text for the instructions, with '\;' between them.

 When the RTL contains two operands which are required by constraint to
match each other, the output template must refer only to the
lower-numbered operand.  Matching operands are not always identical, and
the rest of the compiler arranges to put the proper RTL expression for
printing into the lower-numbered operand.

 One use of nonstandard letters or punctuation following '%' is to
distinguish between different assembler languages for the same machine;
for example, Motorola syntax versus MIT syntax for the 68000.  Motorola
syntax requires periods in most opcode names, while MIT syntax does not.
For example, the opcode 'movel' in MIT syntax is 'move.l' in Motorola
syntax.  The same file of patterns is used for both kinds of output
syntax, but the character sequence '%.' is used in each place where
Motorola syntax wants a period.  The 'PRINT_OPERAND' macro for Motorola
syntax defines the sequence to output a period; the macro for MIT syntax
defines it to do nothing.

 As a special case, a template consisting of the single character '#'
instructs the compiler to first split the insn, and then output the
resulting instructions separately.  This helps eliminate redundancy in
the output templates.  If you have a 'define_insn' that needs to emit
multiple assembler instructions, and there is a matching 'define_split'
already defined, then you can simply use '#' as the output template
instead of writing an output template that emits the multiple assembler
instructions.

 If the macro 'ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is defined, you can use construct of
the form '{option0|option1|option2}' in the templates.  These describe
multiple variants of assembler language syntax.  *Note Instruction
Output::.

16.6 C Statements for Assembler Output
======================================

Often a single fixed template string cannot produce correct and
efficient assembler code for all the cases that are recognized by a
single instruction pattern.  For example, the opcodes may depend on the
kinds of operands; or some unfortunate combinations of operands may
require extra machine instructions.

 If the output control string starts with a '@', then it is actually a
series of templates, each on a separate line.  (Blank lines and leading
spaces and tabs are ignored.)  The templates correspond to the pattern's
constraint alternatives (*note Multi-Alternative::).  For example, if a
target machine has a two-address add instruction 'addr' to add into a
register and another 'addm' to add a register to memory, you might write
this pattern:

     (define_insn "addsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0,0")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g,r")))]
       ""
       "@
        addr %2,%0
        addm %2,%0")

 If the output control string starts with a '*', then it is not an
output template but rather a piece of C program that should compute a
template.  It should execute a 'return' statement to return the
template-string you want.  Most such templates use C string literals,
which require doublequote characters to delimit them.  To include these
doublequote characters in the string, prefix each one with '\'.

 If the output control string is written as a brace block instead of a
double-quoted string, it is automatically assumed to be C code.  In that
case, it is not necessary to put in a leading asterisk, or to escape the
doublequotes surrounding C string literals.

 The operands may be found in the array 'operands', whose C data type is
'rtx []'.

 It is very common to select different ways of generating assembler code
based on whether an immediate operand is within a certain range.  Be
careful when doing this, because the result of 'INTVAL' is an integer on
the host machine.  If the host machine has more bits in an 'int' than
the target machine has in the mode in which the constant will be used,
then some of the bits you get from 'INTVAL' will be superfluous.  For
proper results, you must carefully disregard the values of those bits.

 It is possible to output an assembler instruction and then go on to
output or compute more of them, using the subroutine 'output_asm_insn'.
This receives two arguments: a template-string and a vector of operands.
The vector may be 'operands', or it may be another array of 'rtx' that
you declare locally and initialize yourself.

 When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code can test the
variable 'which_alternative', which is the ordinal number of the
alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for the first, 1 for the
second alternative, etc.).

 For example, suppose there are two opcodes for storing zero, 'clrreg'
for registers and 'clrmem' for memory locations.  Here is how a pattern
could use 'which_alternative' to choose between them:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (const_int 0))]
       ""
       {
       return (which_alternative == 0
               ? "clrreg %0" : "clrmem %0");
       })

 The example above, where the assembler code to generate was _solely_
determined by the alternative, could also have been specified as
follows, having the output control string start with a '@':

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (const_int 0))]
       ""
       "@
        clrreg %0
        clrmem %0")

 If you just need a little bit of C code in one (or a few) alternatives,
you can use '*' inside of a '@' multi-alternative template:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,<,m")
             (const_int 0))]
       ""
       "@
        clrreg %0
        * return stack_mem_p (operands[0]) ? \"push 0\" : \"clrmem %0\";
        clrmem %0")

16.7 Predicates
===============

A predicate determines whether a 'match_operand' or 'match_operator'
expression matches, and therefore whether the surrounding instruction
pattern will be used for that combination of operands.  GCC has a number
of machine-independent predicates, and you can define machine-specific
predicates as needed.  By convention, predicates used with
'match_operand' have names that end in '_operand', and those used with
'match_operator' have names that end in '_operator'.

 All predicates are Boolean functions (in the mathematical sense) of two
arguments: the RTL expression that is being considered at that position
in the instruction pattern, and the machine mode that the
'match_operand' or 'match_operator' specifies.  In this section, the
first argument is called OP and the second argument MODE.  Predicates
can be called from C as ordinary two-argument functions; this can be
useful in output templates or other machine-specific code.

 Operand predicates can allow operands that are not actually acceptable
to the hardware, as long as the constraints give reload the ability to
fix them up (*note Constraints::).  However, GCC will usually generate
better code if the predicates specify the requirements of the machine
instructions as closely as possible.  Reload cannot fix up operands that
must be constants ("immediate operands"); you must use a predicate that
allows only constants, or else enforce the requirement in the extra
condition.

 Most predicates handle their MODE argument in a uniform manner.  If
MODE is 'VOIDmode' (unspecified), then OP can have any mode.  If MODE is
anything else, then OP must have the same mode, unless OP is a
'CONST_INT' or integer 'CONST_DOUBLE'.  These RTL expressions always
have 'VOIDmode', so it would be counterproductive to check that their
mode matches.  Instead, predicates that accept 'CONST_INT' and/or
integer 'CONST_DOUBLE' check that the value stored in the constant will
fit in the requested mode.

 Predicates with this behavior are called "normal".  'genrecog' can
optimize the instruction recognizer based on knowledge of how normal
predicates treat modes.  It can also diagnose certain kinds of common
errors in the use of normal predicates; for instance, it is almost
always an error to use a normal predicate without specifying a mode.

 Predicates that do something different with their MODE argument are
called "special".  The generic predicates 'address_operand' and
'pmode_register_operand' are special predicates.  'genrecog' does not do
any optimizations or diagnosis when special predicates are used.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Machine-Independent Predicates,  Next: Defining Predicates,  Up: Predicates

16.7.1 Machine-Independent Predicates
-------------------------------------

These are the generic predicates available to all back ends.  They are
defined in 'recog.c'.  The first category of predicates allow only
constant, or "immediate", operands.

 -- Function: immediate_operand
     This predicate allows any sort of constant that fits in MODE.  It
     is an appropriate choice for instructions that take operands that
     must be constant.

 -- Function: const_int_operand
     This predicate allows any 'CONST_INT' expression that fits in MODE.
     It is an appropriate choice for an immediate operand that does not
     allow a symbol or label.

 -- Function: const_double_operand
     This predicate accepts any 'CONST_DOUBLE' expression that has
     exactly MODE.  If MODE is 'VOIDmode', it will also accept
     'CONST_INT'.  It is intended for immediate floating point
     constants.

The second category of predicates allow only some kind of machine
register.

 -- Function: register_operand
     This predicate allows any 'REG' or 'SUBREG' expression that is
     valid for MODE.  It is often suitable for arithmetic instruction
     operands on a RISC machine.

 -- Function: pmode_register_operand
     This is a slight variant on 'register_operand' which works around a
     limitation in the machine-description reader.

          (match_operand N "pmode_register_operand" CONSTRAINT)

     means exactly what

          (match_operand:P N "register_operand" CONSTRAINT)

     would mean, if the machine-description reader accepted ':P' mode
     suffixes.  Unfortunately, it cannot, because 'Pmode' is an alias
     for some other mode, and might vary with machine-specific options.
     *Note Misc::.

 -- Function: scratch_operand
     This predicate allows hard registers and 'SCRATCH' expressions, but
     not pseudo-registers.  It is used internally by 'match_scratch'; it
     should not be used directly.

The third category of predicates allow only some kind of memory
reference.

 -- Function: memory_operand
     This predicate allows any valid reference to a quantity of mode
     MODE in memory, as determined by the weak form of
     'GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' (*note Addressing Modes::).

 -- Function: address_operand
     This predicate is a little unusual; it allows any operand that is a
     valid expression for the _address_ of a quantity of mode MODE,
     again determined by the weak form of 'GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.
     To first order, if '(mem:MODE (EXP))' is acceptable to
     'memory_operand', then EXP is acceptable to 'address_operand'.
     Note that EXP does not necessarily have the mode MODE.

 -- Function: indirect_operand
     This is a stricter form of 'memory_operand' which allows only
     memory references with a 'general_operand' as the address
     expression.  New uses of this predicate are discouraged, because
     'general_operand' is very permissive, so it's hard to tell what an
     'indirect_operand' does or does not allow.  If a target has
     different requirements for memory operands for different
     instructions, it is better to define target-specific predicates
     which enforce the hardware's requirements explicitly.

 -- Function: push_operand
     This predicate allows a memory reference suitable for pushing a
     value onto the stack.  This will be a 'MEM' which refers to
     'stack_pointer_rtx', with a side-effect in its address expression
     (*note Incdec::); which one is determined by the 'STACK_PUSH_CODE'
     macro (*note Frame Layout::).

 -- Function: pop_operand
     This predicate allows a memory reference suitable for popping a
     value off the stack.  Again, this will be a 'MEM' referring to
     'stack_pointer_rtx', with a side-effect in its address expression.
     However, this time 'STACK_POP_CODE' is expected.

The fourth category of predicates allow some combination of the above
operands.

 -- Function: nonmemory_operand
     This predicate allows any immediate or register operand valid for
     MODE.

 -- Function: nonimmediate_operand
     This predicate allows any register or memory operand valid for
     MODE.

 -- Function: general_operand
     This predicate allows any immediate, register, or memory operand
     valid for MODE.

Finally, there are two generic operator predicates.

 -- Function: comparison_operator
     This predicate matches any expression which performs an arithmetic
     comparison in MODE; that is, 'COMPARISON_P' is true for the
     expression code.

 -- Function: ordered_comparison_operator
     This predicate matches any expression which performs an arithmetic
     comparison in MODE and whose expression code is valid for integer
     modes; that is, the expression code will be one of 'eq', 'ne',
     'lt', 'ltu', 'le', 'leu', 'gt', 'gtu', 'ge', 'geu'.

16.7.2 Defining Machine-Specific Predicates
-------------------------------------------

Many machines have requirements for their operands that cannot be
expressed precisely using the generic predicates.  You can define
additional predicates using 'define_predicate' and
'define_special_predicate' expressions.  These expressions have three
operands:

   * The name of the predicate, as it will be referred to in
     'match_operand' or 'match_operator' expressions.

   * An RTL expression which evaluates to true if the predicate allows
     the operand OP, false if it does not.  This expression can only use
     the following RTL codes:

     'MATCH_OPERAND'
          When written inside a predicate expression, a 'MATCH_OPERAND'
          expression evaluates to true if the predicate it names would
          allow OP.  The operand number and constraint are ignored.  Due
          to limitations in 'genrecog', you can only refer to generic
          predicates and predicates that have already been defined.

     'MATCH_CODE'
          This expression evaluates to true if OP or a specified
          subexpression of OP has one of a given list of RTX codes.

          The first operand of this expression is a string constant
          containing a comma-separated list of RTX code names (in lower
          case).  These are the codes for which the 'MATCH_CODE' will be
          true.

          The second operand is a string constant which indicates what
          subexpression of OP to examine.  If it is absent or the empty
          string, OP itself is examined.  Otherwise, the string constant
          must be a sequence of digits and/or lowercase letters.  Each
          character indicates a subexpression to extract from the
          current expression; for the first character this is OP, for
          the second and subsequent characters it is the result of the
          previous character.  A digit N extracts 'XEXP (E, N)'; a
          letter L extracts 'XVECEXP (E, 0, N)' where N is the
          alphabetic ordinal of L (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and so on).
          The 'MATCH_CODE' then examines the RTX code of the
          subexpression extracted by the complete string.  It is not
          possible to extract components of an 'rtvec' that is not at
          position 0 within its RTX object.

     'MATCH_TEST'
          This expression has one operand, a string constant containing
          a C expression.  The predicate's arguments, OP and MODE, are
          available with those names in the C expression.  The
          'MATCH_TEST' evaluates to true if the C expression evaluates
          to a nonzero value.  'MATCH_TEST' expressions must not have
          side effects.

     'AND'
     'IOR'
     'NOT'
     'IF_THEN_ELSE'
          The basic 'MATCH_' expressions can be combined using these
          logical operators, which have the semantics of the C operators
          '&&', '||', '!', and '? :' respectively.  As in Common Lisp,
          you may give an 'AND' or 'IOR' expression an arbitrary number
          of arguments; this has exactly the same effect as writing a
          chain of two-argument 'AND' or 'IOR' expressions.

   * An optional block of C code, which should execute 'return true' if
     the predicate is found to match and 'return false' if it does not.
     It must not have any side effects.  The predicate arguments, OP and
     MODE, are available with those names.

     If a code block is present in a predicate definition, then the RTL
     expression must evaluate to true _and_ the code block must execute
     'return true' for the predicate to allow the operand.  The RTL
     expression is evaluated first; do not re-check anything in the code
     block that was checked in the RTL expression.

 The program 'genrecog' scans 'define_predicate' and
'define_special_predicate' expressions to determine which RTX codes are
possibly allowed.  You should always make this explicit in the RTL
predicate expression, using 'MATCH_OPERAND' and 'MATCH_CODE'.

 Here is an example of a simple predicate definition, from the IA64
machine description:

     ;; True if OP is a 'SYMBOL_REF' which refers to the sdata section.
     (define_predicate "small_addr_symbolic_operand"
       (and (match_code "symbol_ref")
            (match_test "SYMBOL_REF_SMALL_ADDR_P (op)")))

And here is another, showing the use of the C block.

     ;; True if OP is a register operand that is (or could be) a GR reg.
     (define_predicate "gr_register_operand"
       (match_operand 0 "register_operand")
     {
       unsigned int regno;
       if (GET_CODE (op) == SUBREG)
         op = SUBREG_REG (op);

       regno = REGNO (op);
       return (regno >= FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER || GENERAL_REGNO_P (regno));
     })

 Predicates written with 'define_predicate' automatically include a test
that MODE is 'VOIDmode', or OP has the same mode as MODE, or OP is a
'CONST_INT' or 'CONST_DOUBLE'.  They do _not_ check specifically for
integer 'CONST_DOUBLE', nor do they test that the value of either kind
of constant fits in the requested mode.  This is because target-specific
predicates that take constants usually have to do more stringent value
checks anyway.  If you need the exact same treatment of 'CONST_INT' or
'CONST_DOUBLE' that the generic predicates provide, use a
'MATCH_OPERAND' subexpression to call 'const_int_operand',
'const_double_operand', or 'immediate_operand'.

 Predicates written with 'define_special_predicate' do not get any
automatic mode checks, and are treated as having special mode handling
by 'genrecog'.

 The program 'genpreds' is responsible for generating code to test
predicates.  It also writes a header file containing function
declarations for all machine-specific predicates.  It is not necessary
to declare these predicates in 'CPU-protos.h'.

16.8 Operand Constraints
========================

Each 'match_operand' in an instruction pattern can specify constraints
for the operands allowed.  The constraints allow you to fine-tune
matching within the set of operands allowed by the predicate.

 Constraints can say whether an operand may be in a register, and which
kinds of register; whether the operand can be a memory reference, and
which kinds of address; whether the operand may be an immediate
constant, and which possible values it may have.  Constraints can also
require two operands to match.  Side-effects aren't allowed in operands
of inline 'asm', unless '<' or '>' constraints are used, because there
is no guarantee that the side-effects will happen exactly once in an
instruction that can update the addressing register.

The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are the
letters that are allowed:

whitespace
     Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any
     position except the first.  This enables each alternative for
     different operands to be visually aligned in the machine
     description even if they have different number of constraints and
     modifiers.

'm'
     A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the
     machine supports in general.  Note that the letter used for the
     general memory constraint can be re-defined by a back end using the
     'TARGET_MEM_CONSTRAINT' macro.

'o'
     A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
     "offsettable".  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
     the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine
     mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid
     memory address.

     For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
     address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
     slightly larger constant is also within the range of
     address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or
     autodecrement address is not offsettable.  More complicated
     indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending
     on the other addressing modes that the machine supports.

     Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
     operand, the constraint letter 'o' is valid only when accompanied
     by both '<' (if the target machine has predecrement addressing) and
     '>' (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

'V'
     A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything
     that would fit the 'm' constraint but not the 'o' constraint.

'<'
     A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement
     or postdecrement) is allowed.  In inline 'asm' this constraint is
     only allowed if the operand is used exactly once in an instruction
     that can handle the side-effects.  Not using an operand with '<' in
     constraint string in the inline 'asm' pattern at all or using it in
     multiple instructions isn't valid, because the side-effects
     wouldn't be performed or would be performed more than once.
     Furthermore, on some targets the operand with '<' in constraint
     string must be accompanied by special instruction suffixes like
     '%U0' instruction suffix on PowerPC or '%P0' on IA-64.

'>'
     A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either preincrement
     or postincrement) is allowed.  In inline 'asm' the same
     restrictions as for '<' apply.

'r'
     A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
     register.

'i'
     An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
     This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
     assembly time or later.

'n'
     An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
     Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands
     less than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use
     'n' rather than 'i'.

'I', 'J', 'K', ... 'P'
     Other letters in the range 'I' through 'P' may be defined in a
     machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
     explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
     68000, 'I' is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
     This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
     instructions.

'E'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code 'const_double') is
     allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same
     as that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).

'F'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code 'const_double' or
     'const_vector') is allowed.

'G', 'H'
     'G' and 'H' may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to permit
     immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.

's'
     An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer
     is allowed.

     This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand
     with a value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any
     known value.  So why use 's' instead of 'i'?  Sometimes it allows
     better code to be generated.

     For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible
     to use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between
     -128 and 127, better code results from loading the value into a
     register and using the register.  This is because the load into the
     register can be done with a 'moveq' instruction.  We arrange for
     this to happen by defining the letter 'K' to mean "any integer
     outside the range -128 to 127", and then specifying 'Ks' in the
     operand constraints.

'g'
     Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed,
     except for registers that are not general registers.

'X'
     Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
     'general_operand'.  This is normally used in the constraint of a
     'match_scratch' when certain alternatives will not actually require
     a scratch register.

'0', '1', '2', ... '9'
     An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.
     If a digit is used together with letters within the same
     alternative, the digit should come last.

     This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
     digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a
     single decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity, since
     to-date it has never been desirable that '10' be interpreted as
     matching either operand 1 _or_ operand 0.  Should this be desired,
     one can use multiple alternatives instead.

     This is called a "matching constraint" and what it really means is
     that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
     considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has
     two input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most
     CISC machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one
     of them an input-output operand:

          addl #35,r12

     Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.  More
     precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
     operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
     smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
     constraint.

     For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
     are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
     specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, '*x' as
     an input operand will match '*x++' as an output operand.  For
     proper results in such cases, the output template should always use
     the output-operand's number when printing the operand.

'p'
     An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is for
     "load address" and "push address" instructions.

     'p' in the constraint must be accompanied by 'address_operand' as
     the predicate in the 'match_operand'.  This predicate interprets
     the mode specified in the 'match_operand' as the mode of the memory
     reference for which the address would be valid.

OTHER-LETTERS
     Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand
     for particular classes of registers or other arbitrary operand
     types.  'd', 'a' and 'f' are defined on the 68000/68020 to stand
     for data, address and floating point registers.

 In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy its
constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern from
applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify the
code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is done by
copying an operand into a register.

 Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
             (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                      (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "...")

which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "...")

which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to
be identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form

     (insn N PREV NEXT
       (set (reg:SI 3)
            (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
       ...)

the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern
would say, "That does not look like an add instruction; try other
patterns".  The second pattern would say, "Yes, that's an add
instruction, but there is something wrong with it".  It would direct the
reload pass of the compiler to generate additional insns to make the
constraint true.  The results might look like this:

     (insn N2 PREV N
       (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
       ...)

     (insn N N2 NEXT
       (set (reg:SI 3)
            (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
       ...)

 It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern
must, for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at
least one alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)
The constraints don't need to _allow_ any possible operand--when this is
the case, they do not constrain--but they must at least point the way to
reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.

   * If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
     there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.

     For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
     registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.

     An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
     provided its constraints include the letter 'i'.  If any possible
     constant value is accepted, then nothing less than 'i' will do; if
     the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
     more selective.

   * Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a
     register.  So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of
     register, it is certain to be safe.  It need not permit all classes
     of registers; the compiler knows how to copy a register into
     another register of the proper class in order to make an
     instruction valid.

   * A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
     address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter 'o',
     all memory references are taken care of.

   * A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
     hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be
     used in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the
     letters 'o' or 'm', constant operands are not a problem.

   * If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in
     an insn was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to a
     constant, the register will be replaced with the constant.  If the
     predicate does not permit a constant and the insn is re-recognized
     for some reason, the compiler will crash.  Thus the predicate must
     always recognize any objects allowed by the constraint.

 If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the constraint
does not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When this operand
happens to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied, because it
does not know how to copy a register temporarily into memory.

 If the predicate accepts a unary operator, the constraint applies to
the operand.  For example, the MIPS processor at ISA level 3 supports an
instruction which adds two registers in 'SImode' to produce a 'DImode'
result, but only if the registers are correctly sign extended.  This
predicate for the input operands accepts a 'sign_extend' of an 'SImode'
register.  Write the constraint to indicate the type of register that is
required for the operand of the 'sign_extend'.

16.8.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints
---------------------------------------

Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can
combine register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine
any kind of operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory
location into another.

 These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An
alternative can be described by a series of letters for each operand.
The overall constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this
operand from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this
operand from the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last
alternative.  Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the
68000:

     (define_insn "iorsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
             (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dKs,dmKs")))]
       ...)

 The first alternative has 'm' (memory) for operand 0, '0' for operand 1
(meaning it must match operand 0), and 'dKs' for operand 2.  The second
alternative has 'd' (data register) for operand 0, '0' for operand 1,
and 'dmKs' for operand 2.  The '=' and '%' in the constraints apply to
all the alternatives; their meaning is explained in the next section
(*note Class Preferences::).

 If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid.
Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many
instructions must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative
applies.  The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two
alternatives need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first
is chosen.  These choices can be altered with the '?' and '!'
characters:

'?'
     Disparage slightly the alternative that the '?' appears in, as a
     choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
     this alternative as one unit more costly for each '?' that appears
     in it.

'!'
     Disparage severely the alternative that the '!' appears in.  This
     alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading, but if
     reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.

 When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
assembler code can use the variable 'which_alternative', which is the
ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for the
first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  *Note Output Statement::.

16.8.3 Register Class Preferences
---------------------------------

The operand constraints have another function: they enable the compiler
to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is best
allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to the
insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the machine-dependent
letters such as 'd' and 'a' that specify classes of registers.  The
pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most "votes".  The
constraint letters 'g' and 'r' also vote: they vote in favor of a
general register.  The machine description says which registers are
considered general.

 Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no
register classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Next: Machine Constraints,  Prev: Class Preferences,  Up: Constraints

16.8.4 Constraint Modifier Characters
-------------------------------------

Here are constraint modifier characters.

'='
     Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the
     previous value is discarded and replaced by output data.

'+'
     Means that this operand is both read and written by the
     instruction.

     When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
     it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
     which are outputs from it.  '=' identifies an output; '+'
     identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other
     operands are assumed to be input only.

     If you specify '=' or '+' in a constraint, you put it in the first
     character of the constraint string.

'&'
     Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
     "earlyclobber" operand, which is modified before the instruction is
     finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not
     lie in a register that is used as an input operand or as part of
     any memory address.

     '&' applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
     constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
     requires '&' while others do not.  See, for example, the 'movdf'
     insn of the 68000.

     An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
     use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
     alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
     when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber.
     See, for example, the 'mulsi3' insn of the ARM.

     '&' does not obviate the need to write '='.

'%'
     Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
     following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange
     the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands
     fit the constraints.  This is often used in patterns for addition
     instructions that really have only two operands: the result must go
     in one of the arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000
     halfword-add instruction is defined:

          (define_insn "addhi3"
            [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
               (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                        (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
            ...)
     GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use
     more, the compiler may fail.  Note that you need not use the
     modifier if the two alternatives are strictly identical; this would
     only waste time in the reload pass.  The modifier is not
     operational after register allocation, so the result of
     'define_peephole2' and 'define_split's performed after reload
     cannot rely on '%' to make the intended insn match.

'#'
     Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
     ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
     register preferences.

'*'
     Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
     register preferences.  '*' has no effect on the meaning of the
     constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.  For LRA
     '*' additionally disparages slightly the alternative if the
     following character matches the operand.

     Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
     halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
     copying it into an address register.  While either kind of register
     is acceptable, the constraints on an address-register destination
     are less strict, so it is best if register allocation makes an
     address register its goal.  Therefore, '*' is used so that the 'd'
     constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when computing
     register preferences.

          (define_insn "extendhisi2"
            [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=*d,a")
                  (sign_extend:SI
                   (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "0,g")))]
            ...)

16.8.5 Constraints for Particular Machines
------------------------------------------

Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in 'asm' arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters that
usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are 'm' and 'r' (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; *note Simple Constraints::), and
'I', usually the letter indicating the most common immediate-constant
format.

 Each architecture defines additional constraints.  These constraints
are used by the compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as
for 'asm' statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not
particularly useful for 'asm'.  Here is a summary of some of the
machine-dependent constraints available on some particular machines; it
includes both constraints that are useful for 'asm' and constraints that
aren't.  The compiler source file mentioned in the table heading for
each architecture is the definitive reference for the meanings of that
architecture's constraints.

          Integer/Floating point constant that can be loaded into a
          register using three instructions

     'm'
          Memory operand.  Normally, 'm' does not allow addresses that
          update the base register.  If '<' or '>' constraint is also
          used, they are allowed and therefore on PowerPC targets in
          that case it is only safe to use 'm<>' in an 'asm' statement
          if that 'asm' statement accesses the operand exactly once.
          The 'asm' statement must also use '%U<OPNO>' as a placeholder
          for the "update" flag in the corresponding load or store
          instruction.  For example:

               asm ("st%U0 %1,%0" : "=m<>" (mem) : "r" (val));

          is correct but:

               asm ("st %1,%0" : "=m<>" (mem) : "r" (val));

          is not.

     'es'
          A "stable" memory operand; that is, one which does not include
          any automodification of the base register.  This used to be
          useful when 'm' allowed automodification of the base register,
          but as those are now only allowed when '<' or '>' is used,
          'es' is basically the same as 'm' without '<' and '>'.

     'Q'
          Memory operand that is an offset from a register (it is
          usually better to use 'm' or 'es' in 'asm' statements)

     'Z'
          Memory operand that is an indexed or indirect from a register
          (it is usually better to use 'm' or 'es' in 'asm' statements)

     'R'
          AIX TOC entry

     'a'
          Address operand that is an indexed or indirect from a register
          ('p' is preferable for 'asm' statements)

          Legacy register--the eight integer registers available on all

     'q'
          Any register accessible as 'Rl'.  In 32-bit mode, 'a', 'b',
          'c', and 'd'; in 64-bit mode, any integer register.

     'Q'
          Any register accessible as 'Rh': 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.

     'l'

     'A'
          The 'a' and 'd' registers.  This class is used for
          instructions that return double word results in the 'ax:dx'
          register pair.  Single word values will be allocated either in
          'ax' or 'dx'.  For example on i386 the following implements
          'rdtsc':

               unsigned long long rdtsc (void)
               {
                 unsigned long long tick;

                 return tick;
               }

          This is not correct on x86_64 as it would allocate tick in
          either 'ax' or 'dx'.  You have to use the following variant
          instead:

               unsigned long long rdtsc (void)
               {
                 unsigned int tickl, tickh;
                 __asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc":"=a"(tickl),"=d"(tickh));

16.8.6 Disable insn alternatives using the 'enabled' attribute
--------------------------------------------------------------

The 'enabled' insn attribute may be used to disable certain insn
alternatives for machine-specific reasons.  This is useful when adding
new instructions to an existing pattern which are only available for
certain cpu architecture levels as specified with the '-march=' option.

 If an insn alternative is disabled, then it will never be used.  The
compiler treats the constraints for the disabled alternative as
unsatisfiable.

 In order to make use of the 'enabled' attribute a back end has to add
in the machine description files:

  1. A definition of the 'enabled' insn attribute.  The attribute is
     defined as usual using the 'define_attr' command.  This definition
     should be based on other insn attributes and/or target flags.  The
     'enabled' attribute is a numeric attribute and should evaluate to
     '(const_int 1)' for an enabled alternative and to '(const_int 0)'
     otherwise.
  2. A definition of another insn attribute used to describe for what
     reason an insn alternative might be available or not.  E.g.
     'cpu_facility' as in the example below.
  3. An assignment for the second attribute to each insn definition
     combining instructions which are not all available under the same
     circumstances.  (Note: It obviously only makes sense for
     definitions with more than one alternative.  Otherwise the insn
     pattern should be disabled or enabled using the insn condition.)

 E.g.  the following two patterns could easily be merged using the
'enabled' attribute:


     (define_insn "*movdi_old"
       [(set (match_operand:DI 0 "register_operand" "=d")
             (match_operand:DI 1 "register_operand" " d"))]
       "!TARGET_NEW"
       "lgr %0,%1")

     (define_insn "*movdi_new"
       [(set (match_operand:DI 0 "register_operand" "=d,f,d")
             (match_operand:DI 1 "register_operand" " d,d,f"))]
       "TARGET_NEW"
       "@
        lgr  %0,%1
        ldgr %0,%1
        lgdr %0,%1")


 to:


     (define_insn "*movdi_combined"
       [(set (match_operand:DI 0 "register_operand" "=d,f,d")
             (match_operand:DI 1 "register_operand" " d,d,f"))]
       ""
       "@
        lgr  %0,%1
        ldgr %0,%1
        lgdr %0,%1"
       [(set_attr "cpu_facility" "*,new,new")])


 with the 'enabled' attribute defined like this:


     (define_attr "cpu_facility" "standard,new" (const_string "standard"))

     (define_attr "enabled" ""
       (cond [(eq_attr "cpu_facility" "standard") (const_int 1)
              (and (eq_attr "cpu_facility" "new")
                   (ne (symbol_ref "TARGET_NEW") (const_int 0)))
              (const_int 1)]
             (const_int 0)))

16.8.7 Defining Machine-Specific Constraints
--------------------------------------------

Machine-specific constraints fall into two categories: register and
non-register constraints.  Within the latter category, constraints which
allow subsets of all possible memory or address operands should be
specially marked, to give 'reload' more information.

 Machine-specific constraints can be given names of arbitrary length,
but they must be entirely composed of letters, digits, underscores
('_'), and angle brackets ('< >').  Like C identifiers, they must begin
with a letter or underscore.

 In order to avoid ambiguity in operand constraint strings, no
constraint can have a name that begins with any other constraint's name.
For example, if 'x' is defined as a constraint name, 'xy' may not be,
and vice versa.  As a consequence of this rule, no constraint may begin
with one of the generic constraint letters: 'E F V X g i m n o p r s'.

 Register constraints correspond directly to register classes.  *Note
Register Classes::.  There is thus not much flexibility in their
definitions.

 -- MD Expression: define_register_constraint name regclass docstring
     All three arguments are string constants.  NAME is the name of the
     constraint, as it will appear in 'match_operand' expressions.  If
     NAME is a multi-letter constraint its length shall be the same for
     all constraints starting with the same letter.  REGCLASS can be
     either the name of the corresponding register class (*note Register
     Classes::), or a C expression which evaluates to the appropriate
     register class.  If it is an expression, it must have no side
     effects, and it cannot look at the operand.  The usual use of
     expressions is to map some register constraints to 'NO_REGS' when
     the register class is not available on a given subarchitecture.

     DOCSTRING is a sentence documenting the meaning of the constraint.
     Docstrings are explained further below.

 Non-register constraints are more like predicates: the constraint
definition gives a Boolean expression which indicates whether the
constraint matches.

 -- MD Expression: define_constraint name docstring exp
     The NAME and DOCSTRING arguments are the same as for
     'define_register_constraint', but note that the docstring comes
     immediately after the name for these expressions.  EXP is an RTL
     expression, obeying the same rules as the RTL expressions in
     predicate definitions.  *Note Defining Predicates::, for details.
     If it evaluates true, the constraint matches; if it evaluates
     false, it doesn't.  Constraint expressions should indicate which
     RTL codes they might match, just like predicate expressions.

     'match_test' C expressions have access to the following variables:

     OP
          The RTL object defining the operand.
     MODE
          The machine mode of OP.
     IVAL
          'INTVAL (OP)', if OP is a 'const_int'.
     HVAL
          'CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH (OP)', if OP is an integer 'const_double'.
     LVAL
          'CONST_DOUBLE_LOW (OP)', if OP is an integer 'const_double'.
     RVAL
          'CONST_DOUBLE_REAL_VALUE (OP)', if OP is a floating-point
          'const_double'.

     The *VAL variables should only be used once another piece of the
     expression has verified that OP is the appropriate kind of RTL
     object.

 Most non-register constraints should be defined with
'define_constraint'.  The remaining two definition expressions are only
appropriate for constraints that should be handled specially by 'reload'
if they fail to match.

 -- MD Expression: define_memory_constraint name docstring exp
     Use this expression for constraints that match a subset of all
     memory operands: that is, 'reload' can make them match by
     converting the operand to the form '(mem (reg X))', where X is a
     base register (from the register class specified by
     'BASE_REG_CLASS', *note Register Classes::).

     For example, on the S/390, some instructions do not accept
     arbitrary memory references, but only those that do not make use of
     an index register.  The constraint letter 'Q' is defined to
     represent a memory address of this type.  If 'Q' is defined with
     'define_memory_constraint', a 'Q' constraint can handle any memory
     operand, because 'reload' knows it can simply copy the memory
     address into a base register if required.  This is analogous to the
     way an 'o' constraint can handle any memory operand.

     The syntax and semantics are otherwise identical to
     'define_constraint'.

 -- MD Expression: define_address_constraint name docstring exp
     Use this expression for constraints that match a subset of all
     address operands: that is, 'reload' can make the constraint match
     by converting the operand to the form '(reg X)', again with X a
     base register.

     Constraints defined with 'define_address_constraint' can only be
     used with the 'address_operand' predicate, or machine-specific
     predicates that work the same way.  They are treated analogously to
     the generic 'p' constraint.

     The syntax and semantics are otherwise identical to
     'define_constraint'.

 For historical reasons, names beginning with the letters 'G H' are
reserved for constraints that match only 'const_double's, and names
beginning with the letters 'I J K L M N O P' are reserved for
constraints that match only 'const_int's.  This may change in the
future.  For the time being, constraints with these names must be
written in a stylized form, so that 'genpreds' can tell you did it
correctly:

     (define_constraint "[GHIJKLMNOP]..."
       "DOC..."
       (and (match_code "const_int")  ; 'const_double' for G/H
            CONDITION...))            ; usually a 'match_test'

 It is fine to use names beginning with other letters for constraints
that match 'const_double's or 'const_int's.

 Each docstring in a constraint definition should be one or more
complete sentences, marked up in Texinfo format.  _They are currently
unused._  In the future they will be copied into the GCC manual, in
*note Machine Constraints::, replacing the hand-maintained tables
currently found in that section.  Also, in the future the compiler may
use this to give more helpful diagnostics when poor choice of 'asm'
constraints causes a reload failure.

 If you put the pseudo-Texinfo directive '@internal' at the beginning of
a docstring, then (in the future) it will appear only in the internals
manual's version of the machine-specific constraint tables.  Use this
for constraints that should not appear in 'asm' statements.

16.8.8 Testing constraints from C
---------------------------------

It is occasionally useful to test a constraint from C code rather than
implicitly via the constraint string in a 'match_operand'.  The
generated file 'tm_p.h' declares a few interfaces for working with
machine-specific constraints.  None of these interfaces work with the
generic constraints described in *note Simple Constraints::.  This may
change in the future.

 *Warning:* 'tm_p.h' may declare other functions that operate on
constraints, besides the ones documented here.  Do not use those
functions from machine-dependent code.  They exist to implement the old
constraint interface that machine-independent components of the compiler
still expect.  They will change or disappear in the future.

 Some valid constraint names are not valid C identifiers, so there is a
mangling scheme for referring to them from C.  Constraint names that do
not contain angle brackets or underscores are left unchanged.
Underscores are doubled, each '<' is replaced with '_l', and each '>'
with '_g'.  Here are some examples:

     *Original* *Mangled*  
     x          x       
     P42x       P42x    
     P4_x       P4__x   
     P4>x       P4_gx   
     P4>>       P4_g_g  
     P4_g>      P4__g_g 

 Throughout this section, the variable C is either a constraint in the
abstract sense, or a constant from 'enum constraint_num'; the variable M
is a mangled constraint name (usually as part of a larger identifier).

 -- Enum: constraint_num
     For each machine-specific constraint, there is a corresponding
     enumeration constant: 'CONSTRAINT_' plus the mangled name of the
     constraint.  Functions that take an 'enum constraint_num' as an
     argument expect one of these constants.

     Machine-independent constraints do not have associated constants.
     This may change in the future.

 -- Function: inline bool satisfies_constraint_ M (rtx EXP)
     For each machine-specific, non-register constraint M, there is one
     of these functions; it returns 'true' if EXP satisfies the
     constraint.  These functions are only visible if 'rtl.h' was
     included before 'tm_p.h'.

 -- Function: bool constraint_satisfied_p (rtx EXP, enum constraint_num
          C)
     Like the 'satisfies_constraint_M' functions, but the constraint to
     test is given as an argument, C.  If C specifies a register
     constraint, this function will always return 'false'.

 -- Function: enum reg_class regclass_for_constraint (enum
          constraint_num C)
     Returns the register class associated with C.  If C is not a
     register constraint, or those registers are not available for the
     currently selected subtarget, returns 'NO_REGS'.

 Here is an example use of 'satisfies_constraint_M'.  In peephole
optimizations (*note Peephole Definitions::), operand constraint strings
are ignored, so if there are relevant constraints, they must be tested
in the C condition.  In the example, the optimization is applied if
operand 2 does _not_ satisfy the 'K' constraint.  (This is a simplified
version of a peephole definition from the i386 machine description.)

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 3 "r")
        (set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (mult:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "memory_operand" "")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "immediate_operand" "")))]

       "!satisfies_constraint_K (operands[2])"

       [(set (match_dup 3) (match_dup 1))
        (set (match_dup 0) (mult:SI (match_dup 3) (match_dup 2)))]

       "")


File: gccint.info,  Node: Standard Names,  Next: Pattern Ordering,  Prev: Constraints,  Up: Machine Desc

16.9 Standard Pattern Names For Generation
==========================================

Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the RTL
generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern to accomplish a certain task.

'movM'
     Here M stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lowercase.
     This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from
     operand 1 to operand 0.  For example, 'movsi' moves full-word data.

     If operand 0 is a 'subreg' with mode M of a register whose own mode
     is wider than M, the effect of this instruction is to store the
     specified value in the part of the register that corresponds to
     mode M.  Bits outside of M, but which are within the same target
     word as the 'subreg' are undefined.  Bits which are outside the
     target word are left unchanged.

     This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all,
     each of these names up to and including full word size _must_ be
     defined, because there is no other way to copy a datum from one
     place to another.  If there are patterns accepting operands in
     larger modes, 'movM' must be defined for integer modes of those
     sizes.

     Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation
     pass.  Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values
     from stack slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one of
     the operands is a hard register and the other is an operand that
     can need to be reloaded into a register.

     Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must
     generate RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary
     registers--no registers other than the operands.  For example, if
     you support the pattern with a 'define_expand', then in such a case
     the 'define_expand' mustn't call 'force_reg' or any other such
     function which might generate new pseudo registers.

     This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine
     where fetching those modes from memory normally requires several
     insns and some temporary registers.

     During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be
     passed as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a
     valid address later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may
     be done with the address except to use it as it stands.  If it is
     copied, it will not be replaced with a valid address.  No attempt
     should be made to make such an address into a valid address and no
     routine (such as 'change_address') that will do so may be called.
     Note that 'general_operand' will fail when applied to such an
     address.

     The global variable 'reload_in_progress' (which must be explicitly
     declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
     handling is required.

     The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of
     the machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can
     only be pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on
     other machines explicit memory references will get optional
     reloads.

     If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from
     memory, it can be allocated using 'gen_reg_rtx' prior to life
     analysis.

     If there are cases which need scratch registers during or after
     reload, you must provide an appropriate secondary_reload target
     hook.

     The macro 'can_create_pseudo_p' can be used to determine if it is
     unsafe to create new pseudo registers.  If this variable is
     nonzero, then it is unsafe to call 'gen_reg_rtx' to allocate a new
     pseudo.

     The constraints on a 'movM' must permit moving any hard register to
     any other hard register provided that 'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' permits
     mode M in both registers and 'TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to
     their classes returns a value of 2.

     It is obligatory to support floating point 'movM' instructions into
     and out of any registers that can hold fixed point values, because
     unions and structures (which have modes 'SImode' or 'DImode') can
     be in those registers and they may have floating point members.

     There may also be a need to support fixed point 'movM' instructions
     in and out of floating point registers.  Unfortunately, I have
     forgotten why this was so, and I don't know whether it is still
     true.  If 'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' rejects fixed point values in
     floating point registers, then the constraints of the fixed point
     'movM' instructions must be designed to avoid ever trying to reload
     into a floating point register.

'reload_inM'
'reload_outM'
     These named patterns have been obsoleted by the target hook
     'secondary_reload'.

     Like 'movM', but used when a scratch register is required to move
     between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
     register.  See the discussion of the 'SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' macro
     in *note Register Classes::.

     There are special restrictions on the form of the 'match_operand's
     used in these patterns.  First, only the predicate for the reload
     operand is examined, i.e., 'reload_in' examines operand 1, but not
     the predicates for operand 0 or 2.  Second, there may be only one
     alternative in the constraints.  Third, only a single register
     class letter may be used for the constraint; subsequent constraint
     letters are ignored.  As a special exception, an empty constraint
     string matches the 'ALL_REGS' register class.  This may relieve
     ports of the burden of defining an 'ALL_REGS' constraint letter
     just for these patterns.

'movstrictM'
     Like 'movM' except that if operand 0 is a 'subreg' with mode M of a
     register whose natural mode is wider, the 'movstrictM' instruction
     is guaranteed not to alter any of the register except the part
     which belongs to mode M.

'movmisalignM'
     This variant of a move pattern is designed to load or store a value
     from a memory address that is not naturally aligned for its mode.
     For a store, the memory will be in operand 0; for a load, the
     memory will be in operand 1.  The other operand is guaranteed not
     to be a memory, so that it's easy to tell whether this is a load or
     store.

     This pattern is used by the autovectorizer, and when expanding a
     'MISALIGNED_INDIRECT_REF' expression.

'load_multiple'
     Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive
     registers.  Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers,
     operand 1 is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a
     constant: the number of consecutive registers.

     Define this only if the target machine really has such an
     instruction; do not define this if the most efficient way of
     loading consecutive registers from memory is to do them one at a
     time.

     On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
     registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
     ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
     machines, use a 'define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and
     make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.

     Write the generated insn as a 'parallel' with elements being a
     'set' of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
     also need 'use' or 'clobber' elements).  Use a 'match_parallel'
     (*note RTL Template::) to recognize the insn.  See 'rs6000.md' for
     examples of the use of this insn pattern.

'store_multiple'
     Similar to 'load_multiple', but store several consecutive registers
     into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
     consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
     operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.

'vec_load_lanesMN'
     Perform an interleaved load of several vectors from memory operand
     1 into register operand 0.  Both operands have mode M.  The
     register operand is viewed as holding consecutive vectors of mode
     N, while the memory operand is a flat array that contains the same
     number of elements.  The operation is equivalent to:

          int c = GET_MODE_SIZE (M) / GET_MODE_SIZE (N);
          for (j = 0; j < GET_MODE_NUNITS (N); j++)
            for (i = 0; i < c; i++)
              operand0[i][j] = operand1[j * c + i];

     For example, 'vec_load_lanestiv4hi' loads 8 16-bit values from
     memory into a register of mode 'TI'.  The register contains two
     consecutive vectors of mode 'V4HI'.

     This pattern can only be used if:
          TARGET_ARRAY_MODE_SUPPORTED_P (N, C)
     is true.  GCC assumes that, if a target supports this kind of
     instruction for some mode N, it also supports unaligned loads for
     vectors of mode N.

'vec_store_lanesMN'
     Equivalent to 'vec_load_lanesMN', with the memory and register
     operands reversed.  That is, the instruction is equivalent to:

          int c = GET_MODE_SIZE (M) / GET_MODE_SIZE (N);
          for (j = 0; j < GET_MODE_NUNITS (N); j++)
            for (i = 0; i < c; i++)
              operand0[j * c + i] = operand1[i][j];

     for a memory operand 0 and register operand 1.

'vec_setM'
     Set given field in the vector value.  Operand 0 is the vector to
     modify, operand 1 is new value of field and operand 2 specify the
     field index.

'vec_extractM'
     Extract given field from the vector value.  Operand 1 is the
     vector, operand 2 specify field index and operand 0 place to store
     value into.

'vec_initM'
     Initialize the vector to given values.  Operand 0 is the vector to
     initialize and operand 1 is parallel containing values for
     individual fields.

'vcondMN'
     Output a conditional vector move.  Operand 0 is the destination to
     receive a combination of operand 1 and operand 2, which are of mode
     M, dependent on the outcome of the predicate in operand 3 which is
     a vector comparison with operands of mode N in operands 4 and 5.
     The modes M and N should have the same size.  Operand 0 will be set
     to the value OP1 & MSK | OP2 & ~MSK where MSK is computed by
     element-wise evaluation of the vector comparison with a truth value
     of all-ones and a false value of all-zeros.

'vec_permM'
     Output a (variable) vector permutation.  Operand 0 is the
     destination to receive elements from operand 1 and operand 2, which
     are of mode M.  Operand 3 is the "selector".  It is an integral
     mode vector of the same width and number of elements as mode M.

     The input elements are numbered from 0 in operand 1 through 2*N-1
     in operand 2.  The elements of the selector must be computed modulo
     2*N.  Note that if 'rtx_equal_p(operand1, operand2)', this can be
     implemented with just operand 1 and selector elements modulo N.

     In order to make things easy for a number of targets, if there is
     no 'vec_perm' pattern for mode M, but there is for mode Q where Q
     is a vector of 'QImode' of the same width as M, the middle-end will
     lower the mode M 'VEC_PERM_EXPR' to mode Q.

'vec_perm_constM'
     Like 'vec_perm' except that the permutation is a compile-time
     constant.  That is, operand 3, the "selector", is a 'CONST_VECTOR'.

     Some targets cannot perform a permutation with a variable selector,
     but can efficiently perform a constant permutation.  Further, the
     target hook 'vec_perm_ok' is queried to determine if the specific
     constant permutation is available efficiently; the named pattern is
     never expanded without 'vec_perm_ok' returning true.

     There is no need for a target to supply both 'vec_permM' and
     'vec_perm_constM' if the former can trivially implement the
     operation with, say, the vector constant loaded into a register.

'pushM1'
     Output a push instruction.  Operand 0 is value to push.  Used only
     when 'PUSH_ROUNDING' is defined.  For historical reason, this
     pattern may be missing and in such case an 'mov' expander is used
     instead, with a 'MEM' expression forming the push operation.  The
     'mov' expander method is deprecated.

'addM3'
     Add operand 2 and operand 1, storing the result in operand 0.  All
     operands must have mode M.  This can be used even on two-address
     machines, by means of constraints requiring operands 1 and 0 to be
     the same location.

'addptrM3'
     Like 'addM3' but is guaranteed to only be used for address
     calculations.  The expanded code is not allowed to clobber the
     condition code.  It only needs to be defined if 'addM3' sets the
     condition code.  If adds used for address calculations and normal
     adds are not compatible it is required to expand a distinct pattern
     (e.g.  using an unspec).  The pattern is used by LRA to emit
     address calculations.  'addM3' is used if 'addptrM3' is not
     defined.

'ssaddM3', 'usaddM3'
'subM3', 'sssubM3', 'ussubM3'
'mulM3', 'ssmulM3', 'usmulM3'

'udivM3', 'usdivM3'
'modM3', 'umodM3'
'uminM3', 'umaxM3'
'andM3', 'iorM3', 'xorM3'
     Similar, for other arithmetic operations.

'fmaM4'
     Multiply operand 2 and operand 1, then add operand 3, storing the
     result in operand 0 without doing an intermediate rounding step.
     All operands must have mode M.  This pattern is used to implement
     the 'fma', 'fmaf', and 'fmal' builtin functions from the ISO C99
     standard.

'fmsM4'
     Like 'fmaM4', except operand 3 subtracted from the product instead
     of added to the product.  This is represented in the rtl as

          (fma:M OP1 OP2 (neg:M OP3))

'fnmaM4'
     Like 'fmaM4' except that the intermediate product is negated before
     being added to operand 3.  This is represented in the rtl as

          (fma:M (neg:M OP1) OP2 OP3)

'fnmsM4'
     Like 'fmsM4' except that the intermediate product is negated before
     subtracting operand 3.  This is represented in the rtl as

          (fma:M (neg:M OP1) OP2 (neg:M OP3))

'sminM3', 'smaxM3'
     Signed minimum and maximum operations.  When used with floating
     point, if both operands are zeros, or if either operand is 'NaN',
     then it is unspecified which of the two operands is returned as the
     result.

'reduc_smin_M', 'reduc_smax_M'
     Find the signed minimum/maximum of the elements of a vector.  The
     vector is operand 1, and the scalar result is stored in the least
     significant bits of operand 0 (also a vector).  The output and
     input vector should have the same modes.

'reduc_umin_M', 'reduc_umax_M'
     Find the unsigned minimum/maximum of the elements of a vector.  The
     vector is operand 1, and the scalar result is stored in the least
     significant bits of operand 0 (also a vector).  The output and
     input vector should have the same modes.

'reduc_splus_M'
     Compute the sum of the signed elements of a vector.  The vector is
     operand 1, and the scalar result is stored in the least significant
     bits of operand 0 (also a vector).  The output and input vector
     should have the same modes.

'reduc_uplus_M'
     Compute the sum of the unsigned elements of a vector.  The vector
     is operand 1, and the scalar result is stored in the least
     significant bits of operand 0 (also a vector).  The output and
     input vector should have the same modes.

'sdot_prodM'
'udot_prodM'
     Compute the sum of the products of two signed/unsigned elements.
     Operand 1 and operand 2 are of the same mode.  Their product, which
     is of a wider mode, is computed and added to operand 3.  Operand 3
     is of a mode equal or wider than the mode of the product.  The
     result is placed in operand 0, which is of the same mode as operand
     3.

'ssum_widenM3'
'usum_widenM3'
     Operands 0 and 2 are of the same mode, which is wider than the mode
     of operand 1.  Add operand 1 to operand 2 and place the widened
     result in operand 0.  (This is used express accumulation of
     elements into an accumulator of a wider mode.)

'vec_shl_M', 'vec_shr_M'
     Whole vector left/right shift in bits.  Operand 1 is a vector to be
     shifted.  Operand 2 is an integer shift amount in bits.  Operand 0
     is where the resulting shifted vector is stored.  The output and
     input vectors should have the same modes.

'vec_pack_trunc_M'
     Narrow (demote) and merge the elements of two vectors.  Operands 1
     and 2 are vectors of the same mode having N integral or floating
     point elements of size S.  Operand 0 is the resulting vector in
     which 2*N elements of size N/2 are concatenated after narrowing
     them down using truncation.

'vec_pack_ssat_M', 'vec_pack_usat_M'
     Narrow (demote) and merge the elements of two vectors.  Operands 1
     and 2 are vectors of the same mode having N integral elements of
     size S. Operand 0 is the resulting vector in which the elements of
     the two input vectors are concatenated after narrowing them down
     using signed/unsigned saturating arithmetic.

'vec_pack_sfix_trunc_M', 'vec_pack_ufix_trunc_M'
     Narrow, convert to signed/unsigned integral type and merge the
     elements of two vectors.  Operands 1 and 2 are vectors of the same
     mode having N floating point elements of size S.  Operand 0 is the
     resulting vector in which 2*N elements of size N/2 are
     concatenated.

'vec_unpacks_hi_M', 'vec_unpacks_lo_M'
     Extract and widen (promote) the high/low part of a vector of signed
     integral or floating point elements.  The input vector (operand 1)
     has N elements of size S.  Widen (promote) the high/low elements of
     the vector using signed or floating point extension and place the
     resulting N/2 values of size 2*S in the output vector (operand 0).

'vec_unpacku_hi_M', 'vec_unpacku_lo_M'
     Extract and widen (promote) the high/low part of a vector of
     unsigned integral elements.  The input vector (operand 1) has N
     elements of size S. Widen (promote) the high/low elements of the
     vector using zero extension and place the resulting N/2 values of
     size 2*S in the output vector (operand 0).

'vec_unpacks_float_hi_M', 'vec_unpacks_float_lo_M'
'vec_unpacku_float_hi_M', 'vec_unpacku_float_lo_M'
     Extract, convert to floating point type and widen the high/low part
     of a vector of signed/unsigned integral elements.  The input vector
     (operand 1) has N elements of size S.  Convert the high/low
     elements of the vector using floating point conversion and place
     the resulting N/2 values of size 2*S in the output vector (operand
     0).

'vec_widen_umult_hi_M', 'vec_widen_umult_lo_M'
'vec_widen_smult_hi_M', 'vec_widen_smult_lo_M'
'vec_widen_umult_even_M', 'vec_widen_umult_odd_M'
'vec_widen_smult_even_M', 'vec_widen_smult_odd_M'
     Signed/Unsigned widening multiplication.  The two inputs (operands
     1 and 2) are vectors with N signed/unsigned elements of size S.
     Multiply the high/low or even/odd elements of the two vectors, and
     put the N/2 products of size 2*S in the output vector (operand 0).
     A target shouldn't implement even/odd pattern pair if it is less
     efficient than lo/hi one.

'vec_widen_ushiftl_hi_M', 'vec_widen_ushiftl_lo_M'
'vec_widen_sshiftl_hi_M', 'vec_widen_sshiftl_lo_M'
     Signed/Unsigned widening shift left.  The first input (operand 1)
     is a vector with N signed/unsigned elements of size S.  Operand 2
     is a constant.  Shift the high/low elements of operand 1, and put
     the N/2 results of size 2*S in the output vector (operand 0).

'mulhisi3'
     Multiply operands 1 and 2, which have mode 'HImode', and store a
     'SImode' product in operand 0.

'mulqihi3', 'mulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions of other widths.

'umulqihi3', 'umulhisi3', 'umulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions that do unsigned
     multiplication.

'usmulqihi3', 'usmulhisi3', 'usmulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions that interpret the
     first operand as unsigned and the second operand as signed, then do
     a signed multiplication.

'smulM3_highpart'
     Perform a signed multiplication of operands 1 and 2, which have
     mode M, and store the most significant half of the product in
     operand 0.  The least significant half of the product is discarded.

'umulM3_highpart'
     Similar, but the multiplication is unsigned.

'maddMN4'
     Multiply operands 1 and 2, sign-extend them to mode N, add operand
     3, and store the result in operand 0.  Operands 1 and 2 have mode M
     and operands 0 and 3 have mode N.  Both modes must be integer or
     fixed-point modes and N must be twice the size of M.

     In other words, 'maddMN4' is like 'mulMN3' except that it also adds
     operand 3.

     These instructions are not allowed to 'FAIL'.

'umaddMN4'
     Like 'maddMN4', but zero-extend the multiplication operands instead
     of sign-extending them.

'ssmaddMN4'
     Like 'maddMN4', but all involved operations must be
     signed-saturating.

'usmaddMN4'
     Like 'umaddMN4', but all involved operations must be
     unsigned-saturating.

'msubMN4'
     Multiply operands 1 and 2, sign-extend them to mode N, subtract the
     result from operand 3, and store the result in operand 0.  Operands
     1 and 2 have mode M and operands 0 and 3 have mode N.  Both modes
     must be integer or fixed-point modes and N must be twice the size
     of M.

     In other words, 'msubMN4' is like 'mulMN3' except that it also
     subtracts the result from operand 3.

     These instructions are not allowed to 'FAIL'.

'umsubMN4'
     Like 'msubMN4', but zero-extend the multiplication operands instead
     of sign-extending them.

'ssmsubMN4'
     Like 'msubMN4', but all involved operations must be
     signed-saturating.

'usmsubMN4'
     Like 'umsubMN4', but all involved operations must be
     unsigned-saturating.

'divmodM4'
     Signed division that produces both a quotient and a remainder.
     Operand 1 is divided by operand 2 to produce a quotient stored in
     operand 0 and a remainder stored in operand 3.

     For machines with an instruction that produces both a quotient and
     a remainder, provide a pattern for 'divmodM4' but do not provide
     patterns for 'divM3' and 'modM3'.  This allows optimization in the
     relatively common case when both the quotient and remainder are
     computed.

     If an instruction that just produces a quotient or just a remainder
     exists and is more efficient than the instruction that produces
     both, write the output routine of 'divmodM4' to call
     'find_reg_note' and look for a 'REG_UNUSED' note on the quotient or
     remainder and generate the appropriate instruction.

'udivmodM4'
     Similar, but does unsigned division.

'ashlM3', 'ssashlM3', 'usashlM3'
     Arithmetic-shift operand 1 left by a number of bits specified by
     operand 2, and store the result in operand 0.  Here M is the mode
     of operand 0 and operand 1; operand 2's mode is specified by the
     instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to
     that mode before generating the instruction.  The meaning of
     out-of-range shift counts can optionally be specified by
     'TARGET_SHIFT_TRUNCATION_MASK'.  *Note
     TARGET_SHIFT_TRUNCATION_MASK::.  Operand 2 is always a scalar type.

'ashrM3', 'lshrM3', 'rotlM3', 'rotrM3'
     Other shift and rotate instructions, analogous to the 'ashlM3'
     instructions.  Operand 2 is always a scalar type.

'vashlM3', 'vashrM3', 'vlshrM3', 'vrotlM3', 'vrotrM3'
     Vector shift and rotate instructions that take vectors as operand 2
     instead of a scalar type.

'bswapM2'
     Reverse the order of bytes of operand 1 and store the result in
     operand 0.

'negM2', 'ssnegM2', 'usnegM2'
     Negate operand 1 and store the result in operand 0.

'sqrtM2'
     Store the square root of operand 1 into operand 0.

     The 'sqrt' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'sqrtf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

'fmodM3'
     Store the remainder of dividing operand 1 by operand 2 into operand
     0, rounded towards zero to an integer.

     The 'fmod' built-in function of C always uses the mode which

     The 'cos' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'cosf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type

'sinM2'
     Store the sine of operand 1 into operand 0.

     The 'sin' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'sinf' built-in

'sincosM3'
     Store the cosine of operand 2 into operand 0 and the sine of
     operand 2 into operand 1.

     The 'sin' and 'cos' built-in functions of C always use the mode
     which corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'sinf' and
     'cosf' built-in function use the mode which corresponds to the C
     data type 'float'.  Targets that can calculate the sine and cosine
     simultaneously can implement this pattern as opposed to
     implementing individual 'sinM2' and 'cosM2' patterns.  The 'sin'
     and 'cos' built-in functions will then be expanded to the
     'sincosM3' pattern, with one of the output values left unused.

'expM2'
     Store the exponential of operand 1 into operand 0.

     The 'exp' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'expf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

'logM2'
     Store the natural logarithm of operand 1 into operand 0.

     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'logf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

'powM3'

     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'powf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

'atan2M3'

     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'atan2f' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

     The 'floor' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'floorf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'truncf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type

     The 'round' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'roundf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'ceilf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

'nearbyintM2'
     Store the argument rounded according to the default rounding mode

     The 'nearbyint' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'nearbyintf'
     built-in function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data
     type 'float'.

'rintM2'
     Store the argument rounded according to the default rounding mode
     and raise the inexact exception when the result differs in value
     from the argument

     The 'rint' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'rintf' built-in
     function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data type
     'float'.

'lrintMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number according to the current rounding mode
     and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

'lroundMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number rounding to nearest and away from zero
     and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

'lfloorMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number rounding down and store in operand 0
     (which has mode N).

'lceilMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number rounding up and store in operand 0 (which
     has mode N).

'copysignM3'
     Store a value with the magnitude of operand 1 and the sign of
     operand 2 into operand 0.

     The 'copysign' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'double' and the 'copysignf'
     built-in function uses the mode which corresponds to the C data
     type 'float'.

'ffsM2'
     Store into operand 0 one plus the index of the least significant
     1-bit of operand 1.  If operand 1 is zero, store zero.  M is the
     mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

     The 'ffs' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type 'int'.

'clzM2'
     Store into operand 0 the number of leading 0-bits in X, starting at
     the most significant bit position.  If X is 0, the
     'CLZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO' (*note Misc::) macro defines if the
     result is undefined or has a useful value.  M is the mode of
     operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

'ctzM2'
     Store into operand 0 the number of trailing 0-bits in X, starting
     at the least significant bit position.  If X is 0, the
     'CTZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO' (*note Misc::) macro defines if the
     result is undefined or has a useful value.  M is the mode of
     operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

'popcountM2'
     Store into operand 0 the number of 1-bits in X.  M is the mode of
     operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

'parityM2'
     Store into operand 0 the parity of X, i.e. the number of 1-bits in
     X modulo 2.  M is the mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is
     specified by the instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert
     the operand to that mode before generating the instruction.

'one_cmplM2'
     Store the bitwise-complement of operand 1 into operand 0.

'movmemM'
     Block move instruction.  The destination and source blocks of
     memory are the first two operands, and both are 'mem:BLK's with an
     address in mode 'Pmode'.

     The number of bytes to move is the third operand, in mode M.
     Usually, you specify 'Pmode' for M.  However, if you can generate
     better code knowing the range of valid lengths is smaller than
     those representable in a full Pmode pointer, you should provide a
     pattern with a mode corresponding to the range of values you can
     handle efficiently (e.g., 'QImode' for values in the range 0-127;
     note we avoid numbers that appear negative) and also a pattern with
     'Pmode'.

     The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
     destination, in the form of a 'const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the
     compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
     it may provide the value 4 for this operand.

     Optional operands 5 and 6 specify expected alignment and size of
     block respectively.  The expected alignment differs from alignment
     in operand 4 in a way that the blocks are not required to be
     aligned according to it in all cases.  This expected alignment is
     also in bytes, just like operand 4.  Expected size, when unknown,
     is set to '(const_int -1)'.

     Descriptions of multiple 'movmemM' patterns can only be beneficial
     if the patterns for smaller modes have fewer restrictions on their
     first, second and fourth operands.  Note that the mode M in
     'movmemM' does not impose any restriction on the mode of
     individually moved data units in the block.

     These patterns need not give special consideration to the
     possibility that the source and destination strings might overlap.

'movstr'
     String copy instruction, with 'stpcpy' semantics.  Operand 0 is an
     output operand in mode 'Pmode'.  The addresses of the destination
     and source strings are operands 1 and 2, and both are 'mem:BLK's
     with addresses in mode 'Pmode'.  The execution of the expansion of
     this pattern should store in operand 0 the address in which the
     'NUL' terminator was stored in the destination string.

     This patern has also several optional operands that are same as in
     'setmem'.

'setmemM'
     Block set instruction.  The destination string is the first
     operand, given as a 'mem:BLK' whose address is in mode 'Pmode'.
     The number of bytes to set is the second operand, in mode M.  The
     value to initialize the memory with is the third operand.  Targets
     that only support the clearing of memory should reject any value
     that is not the constant 0.  See 'movmemM' for a discussion of the
     choice of mode.

     The fourth operand is the known alignment of the destination, in
     the form of a 'const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the compiler knows that
     the destination is word-aligned, it may provide the value 4 for
     this operand.

     Optional operands 5 and 6 specify expected alignment and size of
     block respectively.  The expected alignment differs from alignment
     in operand 4 in a way that the blocks are not required to be
     aligned according to it in all cases.  This expected alignment is
     also in bytes, just like operand 4.  Expected size, when unknown,
     is set to '(const_int -1)'.  Operand 7 is the minimal size of the
     block and operand 8 is the maximal size of the block (NULL if it
     can not be represented as CONST_INT). Operand 9 is the probable
     maximal size (i.e.  we can not rely on it for correctness, but it
     can be used for choosing proper code sequence for a given size).

     The use for multiple 'setmemM' is as for 'movmemM'.

'cmpstrnM'
     String compare instruction, with five operands.  Operand 0 is the
     output; it has mode M.  The remaining four operands are like the
     operands of 'movmemM'.  The two memory blocks specified are
     compared byte by byte in lexicographic order starting at the
     beginning of each string.  The instruction is not allowed to
     prefetch more than one byte at a time since either string may end
     in the first byte and reading past that may access an invalid page
     or segment and cause a fault.  The comparison terminates early if
     the fetched bytes are different or if they are equal to zero.  The
     effect of the instruction is to store a value in operand 0 whose
     sign indicates the result of the comparison.

'cmpstrM'
     String compare instruction, without known maximum length.  Operand
     0 is the output; it has mode M.  The second and third operand are
     the blocks of memory to be compared; both are 'mem:BLK' with an
     address in mode 'Pmode'.

     The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
     destination, in the form of a 'const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the
     compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
     it may provide the value 4 for this operand.

     The two memory blocks specified are compared byte by byte in
     lexicographic order starting at the beginning of each string.  The
     instruction is not allowed to prefetch more than one byte at a time
     since either string may end in the first byte and reading past that
     may access an invalid page or segment and cause a fault.  The
     comparison will terminate when the fetched bytes are different or
     if they are equal to zero.  The effect of the instruction is to
     store a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates the result of the
     comparison.

'cmpmemM'
     Block compare instruction, with five operands like the operands of
     'cmpstrM'.  The two memory blocks specified are compared byte by
     byte in lexicographic order starting at the beginning of each
     block.  Unlike 'cmpstrM' the instruction can prefetch any bytes in
     the two memory blocks.  Also unlike 'cmpstrM' the comparison will
     not stop if both bytes are zero.  The effect of the instruction is
     to store a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates the result of
     the comparison.

'strlenM'
     Compute the length of a string, with three operands.  Operand 0 is
     the result (of mode M), operand 1 is a 'mem' referring to the first
     character of the string, operand 2 is the character to search for
     (normally zero), and operand 3 is a constant describing the known
     alignment of the beginning of the string.

'floatMN2'
     Convert signed integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M) to
     floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

'floatunsMN2'
     Convert unsigned integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M)
     to floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

'fixMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number and store in operand 0 (which has mode
     N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value of
     operand 1 is an integer.

     If the machine description defines this pattern, it also needs to
     define the 'ftrunc' pattern.

'fixunsMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as an unsigned number and store in operand 0 (which has mode
     N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value of
     operand 1 is an integer.

'ftruncM2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to an integer
     value, still represented in floating point mode M, and store it in
     operand 0 (valid for floating point mode M).

'fix_truncMN2'
     Like 'fixMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M by
     converting the value to an integer.

'fixuns_truncMN2'
     Like 'fixunsMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M
     by converting the value to an integer.

'truncMN2'
     Truncate operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
     both floating point.

'extendMN2'
     Sign-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
     both floating point.

'zero_extendMN2'
     Zero-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point.

'fractMN2'
     Convert operand 1 of mode M to mode N and store in operand 0 (which
     has mode N).  Mode M and mode N could be fixed-point to
     fixed-point, signed integer to fixed-point, fixed-point to signed
     integer, floating-point to fixed-point, or fixed-point to
     floating-point.  When overflows or underflows happen, the results
     are undefined.

'satfractMN2'
     Convert operand 1 of mode M to mode N and store in operand 0 (which
     has mode N).  Mode M and mode N could be fixed-point to
     fixed-point, signed integer to fixed-point, or floating-point to
     fixed-point.  When overflows or underflows happen, the instruction
     saturates the results to the maximum or the minimum.

'fractunsMN2'
     Convert operand 1 of mode M to mode N and store in operand 0 (which
     has mode N).  Mode M and mode N could be unsigned integer to
     fixed-point, or fixed-point to unsigned integer.  When overflows or
     underflows happen, the results are undefined.

'satfractunsMN2'
     Convert unsigned integer operand 1 of mode M to fixed-point mode N
     and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).  When overflows or
     underflows happen, the instruction saturates the results to the
     maximum or the minimum.

'extvM'
     Extract a bit-field from register operand 1, sign-extend it, and
     store it in operand 0.  Operand 2 specifies the width of the field
     in bits and operand 3 the starting bit, which counts from the most
     significant bit if 'BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' is true and from the least
     significant bit otherwise.

     Operands 0 and 1 both have mode M.  Operands 2 and 3 have a
     target-specific mode.

'extvmisalignM'
     Extract a bit-field from memory operand 1, sign extend it, and
     store it in operand 0.  Operand 2 specifies the width in bits and
     operand 3 the starting bit.  The starting bit is always somewhere
     in the first byte of operand 1; it counts from the most significant
     bit if 'BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' is true and from the least significant bit
     otherwise.

     Operand 0 has mode M while operand 1 has 'BLK' mode.  Operands 2
     and 3 have a target-specific mode.

     The instruction must not read beyond the last byte of the
     bit-field.

'extzvM'
     Like 'extvM' except that the bit-field value is zero-extended.

'extzvmisalignM'
     Like 'extvmisalignM' except that the bit-field value is
     zero-extended.

'insvM'
     Insert operand 3 into a bit-field of register operand 0.  Operand 1
     specifies the width of the field in bits and operand 2 the starting
     bit, which counts from the most significant bit if
     'BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' is true and from the least significant bit
     otherwise.

     Operands 0 and 3 both have mode M.  Operands 1 and 2 have a
     target-specific mode.

'insvmisalignM'
     Insert operand 3 into a bit-field of memory operand 0.  Operand 1
     specifies the width of the field in bits and operand 2 the starting
     bit.  The starting bit is always somewhere in the first byte of
     operand 0; it counts from the most significant bit if
     'BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' is true and from the least significant bit
     otherwise.

     Operand 3 has mode M while operand 0 has 'BLK' mode.  Operands 1
     and 2 have a target-specific mode.

     The instruction must not read or write beyond the last byte of the
     bit-field.

'extv'
     Extract a bit-field from operand 1 (a register or memory operand),
     where operand 2 specifies the width in bits and operand 3 the
     starting bit, and store it in operand 0.  Operand 0 must have mode
     'word_mode'.  Operand 1 may have mode 'byte_mode' or 'word_mode';
     often 'word_mode' is allowed only for registers.  Operands 2 and 3
     must be valid for 'word_mode'.

     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
     constants for operands 2 and 3 and the constant is never zero for
     operand 2.

     The bit-field value is sign-extended to a full word integer before
     it is stored in operand 0.

     This pattern is deprecated; please use 'extvM' and 'extvmisalignM'
     instead.

'extzv'
     Like 'extv' except that the bit-field value is zero-extended.

     This pattern is deprecated; please use 'extzvM' and
     'extzvmisalignM' instead.

'insv'
     Store operand 3 (which must be valid for 'word_mode') into a
     bit-field in operand 0, where operand 1 specifies the width in bits
     and operand 2 the starting bit.  Operand 0 may have mode
     'byte_mode' or 'word_mode'; often 'word_mode' is allowed only for
     registers.  Operands 1 and 2 must be valid for 'word_mode'.

     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
     constants for operands 1 and 2 and the constant is never zero for
     operand 1.

     This pattern is deprecated; please use 'insvM' and 'insvmisalignM'
     instead.

'movMODEcc'
     Conditionally move operand 2 or operand 3 into operand 0 according
     to the comparison in operand 1.  If the comparison is true, operand
     2 is moved into operand 0, otherwise operand 3 is moved.

     The mode of the operands being compared need not be the same as the
     operands being moved.  Some machines, sparc64 for example, have
     instructions that conditionally move an integer value based on the
     floating point condition codes and vice versa.

     If the machine does not have conditional move instructions, do not
     define these patterns.

'addMODEcc'
     Similar to 'movMODEcc' but for conditional addition.  Conditionally
     move operand 2 or (operands 2 + operand 3) into operand 0 according
     to the comparison in operand 1.  If the comparison is false,
     operand 2 is moved into operand 0, otherwise (operand 2 + operand
     3) is moved.

'cstoreMODE4'
     Store zero or nonzero in operand 0 according to whether a
     comparison is true.  Operand 1 is a comparison operator.  Operand 2
     and operand 3 are the first and second operand of the comparison,
     respectively.  You specify the mode that operand 0 must have when
     you write the 'match_operand' expression.  The compiler
     automatically sees which mode you have used and supplies an operand
     of that mode.

     The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit,
     or else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not
     suitable and you should omit it from the machine description.  You
     describe to the compiler exactly which value is stored by defining
     the macro 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::).  If a description
     cannot be found that can be used for all the possible comparison
     operators, you should pick one and use a 'define_expand' to map all
     results onto the one you chose.

     These operations may 'FAIL', but should do so only in relatively
     uncommon cases; if they would 'FAIL' for common cases involving
     integer comparisons, it is best to restrict the predicates to not
     allow these operands.  Likewise if a given comparison operator will
     always fail, independent of the operands (for floating-point modes,
     the 'ordered_comparison_operator' predicate is often useful in this
     case).

     If this pattern is omitted, the compiler will generate a
     conditional branch--for example, it may copy a constant one to the
     target and branching around an assignment of zero to the target--or
     a libcall.  If the predicate for operand 1 only rejects some
     operators, it will also try reordering the operands and/or
     inverting the result value (e.g. by an exclusive OR). These
     possibilities could be cheaper or equivalent to the instructions
     used for the 'cstoreMODE4' pattern followed by those required to
     convert a positive result from 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' to 1; in this
     case, you can and should make operand 1's predicate reject some
     operators in the 'cstoreMODE4' pattern, or remove the pattern
     altogether from the machine description.

'cbranchMODE4'
     Conditional branch instruction combined with a compare instruction.
     Operand 0 is a comparison operator.  Operand 1 and operand 2 are
     the first and second operands of the comparison, respectively.
     Operand 3 is a 'label_ref' that refers to the label to jump to.

'jump'
     A jump inside a function; an unconditional branch.  Operand 0 is
     the 'label_ref' of the label to jump to.  This pattern name is
     mandatory on all machines.

'call'
     Subroutine call instruction returning no value.  Operand 0 is the
     function to call; operand 1 is the number of bytes of arguments
     pushed as a 'const_int'; operand 2 is the number of registers used
     as operands.

     On most machines, operand 2 is not actually stored into the RTL
     pattern.  It is supplied for the sake of some RISC machines which
     need to put this information into the assembler code; they can put
     it in the RTL instead of operand 1.

     Operand 0 should be a 'mem' RTX whose address is the address of the
     function.  Note, however, that this address can be a 'symbol_ref'
     expression even if it would not be a legitimate memory address on
     the target machine.  If it is also not a valid argument for a call
     instruction, the pattern for this operation should be a
     'define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) that places the
     address into a register and uses that register in the call
     instruction.

'call_value'
     Subroutine call instruction returning a value.  Operand 0 is the
     hard register in which the value is returned.  There are three more
     operands, the same as the three operands of the 'call' instruction
     (but with numbers increased by one).

     Subroutines that return 'BLKmode' objects use the 'call' insn.

'call_pop', 'call_value_pop'
     Similar to 'call' and 'call_value', except used if defined and if
     'RETURN_POPS_ARGS' is nonzero.  They should emit a 'parallel' that
     contains both the function call and a 'set' to indicate the
     adjustment made to the frame pointer.

     For machines where 'RETURN_POPS_ARGS' can be nonzero, the use of
     these patterns increases the number of functions for which the
     frame pointer can be eliminated, if desired.

'untyped_call'
     Subroutine call instruction returning a value of any type.  Operand
     0 is the function to call; operand 1 is a memory location where the
     result of calling the function is to be stored; operand 2 is a
     'parallel' expression where each element is a 'set' expression that
     indicates the saving of a function return value into the result
     block.

     This instruction pattern should be defined to support
     '__builtin_apply' on machines where special instructions are needed
     to call a subroutine with arbitrary arguments or to save the value
     returned.  This instruction pattern is required on machines that
     have multiple registers that can hold a return value (i.e.
     'FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' is true for more than one register).

'return'
     Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name
     should be defined only if a single instruction can do all the work
     of returning from a function.

     Like the 'movM' patterns, this pattern is also used after the RTL
     generation phase.  In this case it is to support machines where
     multiple instructions are usually needed to return from a function,
     but some class of functions only requires one instruction to
     implement a return.  Normally, the applicable functions are those
     which do not need to save any registers or allocate stack space.

     It is valid for this pattern to expand to an instruction using
     'simple_return' if no epilogue is required.

'simple_return'
     Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name
     should be defined only if a single instruction can do all the work
     of returning from a function on a path where no epilogue is
     required.  This pattern is very similar to the 'return' instruction
     pattern, but it is emitted only by the shrink-wrapping optimization
     on paths where the function prologue has not been executed, and a
     function return should occur without any of the effects of the
     epilogue.  Additional uses may be introduced on paths where both
     the prologue and the epilogue have executed.

     For such machines, the condition specified in this pattern should
     only be true when 'reload_completed' is nonzero and the function's
     epilogue would only be a single instruction.  For machines with
     register windows, the routine 'leaf_function_p' may be used to
     determine if a register window push is required.

     Machines that have conditional return instructions should define
     patterns such as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (pc)
                  (if_then_else (match_operator
                                   0 "comparison_operator"
                                   [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                                (return)
                                (pc)))]
            "CONDITION"
            "...")

     where CONDITION would normally be the same condition specified on
     the named 'return' pattern.

     cO5      	   1/1.z2197n.  This instruction pattern
     should be defined to support '__builtin_return' on machines where
     special instructions are needed to return a value of any type.

     Operand 0 is a memory location where the result of calling a
     function with '__builtin_apply' is stored; operand 1 is a
     'parallel' expression where each element is a 'set' expression that
     indicates the restoring of a function return value from the result
     block.

'nop'
     No-op instruction.  This instruction pattern name should always be
     defined to output a no-op in assembler code.  '(const_int 0)' will
     do as an RTL pattern.

'indirect_jump'
     An instruction to jump to an address which is operand zero.  This
     pattern name is mandatory on all machines.

'casesi'
     Instruction to jump through a dispatch table, including bounds
     checking.  This instruction takes five operands:

       1. The index to dispatch on, which has mode 'SImode'.

       2. The lower bound for indices in the table, an integer constant.

       3. The total range of indices in the table--the largest index
          minus the smallest one (both inclusive).

       4. A label that precedes the table itself.

       5. A label to jump to if the index has a value outside the
          bounds.

     The table is an 'addr_vec' or 'addr_diff_vec' inside of a
     'jump_table_data'.  The number of elements in the table is one plus
     the difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.

'tablejump'
     Instruction to jump to a variable address.  This is a low-level
     capability which can be used to implement a dispatch table when
     there is no 'casesi' pattern.

     This pattern requires two operands: the address or offset, and a
     label which should immediately precede the jump table.  If the
     macro 'CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE' evaluates to a nonzero value then
     the first operand is an offset which counts from the address of the
     table; otherwise, it is an absolute address to jump to.  In either
     case, the first operand has mode 'Pmode'.

     The 'tablejump' insn is always the last insn before the jump table
     it uses.  Its assembler code normally has no need to use the second
     operand, but you should incorporate it in the RTL pattern so that
     the jump optimizer will not delete the table as unreachable code.

'decrement_and_branch_until_zero'
     Conditional branch instruction that decrements a register and jumps
     if the register is nonzero.  Operand 0 is the register to decrement
     and test; operand 1 is the label to jump to if the register is
     nonzero.  *Note Looping Patterns::.

     This optional instruction pattern is only used by the combiner,
     typically for loops reversed by the loop optimizer when strength
     reduction is enabled.

'doloop_end'
     Conditional branch instruction that decrements a register and jumps
     if the register is nonzero.  Operand 0 is the register to decrement
     and test; operand 1 is the label to jump to if the register is
     nonzero.  *Note Looping Patterns::.

     This optional instruction pattern should be defined for machines
     with low-overhead looping instructions as the loop optimizer will
     try to modify suitable loops to utilize it.  The target hook
     'TARGET_CAN_USE_DOLOOP_P' controls the conditions under which
     low-overhead loops can be used.

'doloop_begin'
     Companion instruction to 'doloop_end' required for machines that
     need to perform some initialization, such as loading a special
     counter register.  Operand 1 is the associated 'doloop_end' pattern
     and operand 0 is the register that it decrements.

     If initialization insns do not always need to be emitted, use a
     'define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and make it fail.

'canonicalize_funcptr_for_compare'
     Canonicalize the function pointer in operand 1 and store the result
     into operand 0.

     Operand 0 is always a 'reg' and has mode 'Pmode'; operand 1 may be
     a 'reg', 'mem', 'symbol_ref', 'const_int', etc and also has mode
     'Pmode'.

     Canonicalization of a function pointer usually involves computing
     the address of the function which would be called if the function
     pointer were used in an indirect call.

     Only define this pattern if function pointers on the target machine
     can have different values but still call the same function when
     used in an indirect call.

'save_stack_block'
'save_stack_function'
'save_stack_nonlocal'
'restore_stack_block'
'restore_stack_function'
'restore_stack_nonlocal'
     Most machines save and restore the stack pointer by copying it to
     or from an object of mode 'Pmode'.  Do not define these patterns on
     such machines.

     Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
     restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to
     the non-standard cases by using a 'define_expand' (*note Expander
     Definitions::) that produces the required insns.  The three types
     of saves and restores are:

       1. 'save_stack_block' saves the stack pointer at the start of a
          block that allocates a variable-sized object, and
          'restore_stack_block' restores the stack pointer when the
          block is exited.

       2. 'save_stack_function' and 'restore_stack_function' do a
          similar job for the outermost block of a function and are used
          when the function allocates variable-sized objects or calls
          'alloca'.  Only the epilogue uses the restored stack pointer,
          allowing a simpler save or restore sequence on some machines.

       3. 'save_stack_nonlocal' is used in functions that contain labels
          branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer
          in such a way that the inner function can use
          'restore_stack_nonlocal' to restore the stack pointer.  The
          compiler generates code to restore the frame and argument
          pointer registers, but some machines require saving and
          restoring additional data such as register window information
          or stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save
          and restore any such required data.

     When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and
     operand 1 is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the save
     area defaults to 'Pmode' but you can override that choice by
     defining the 'STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE' macro (*note Storage Layout::).
     You must specify an integral mode, or 'VOIDmode' if no save area is
     needed for a particular type of save (either because no save is
     needed or because a machine-specific save area can be used).
     Operand 0 is the stack pointer and operand 1 is the save area for
     restore operations.  If 'save_stack_block' is defined, operand 0
     must not be 'VOIDmode' since these saves can be arbitrarily nested.

     A save area is a 'mem' that is at a constant offset from
     'virtual_stack_vars_rtx' when the stack pointer is saved for use by
     nonlocal gotos and a 'reg' in the other two cases.

'allocate_stack'
     Subtract (or add if 'STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is undefined) operand 1
     from the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated
     data.

     Store the resultant pointer to this space into operand 0.  If you
     are allocating space from the main stack, do this by emitting a
     move insn to copy 'virtual_stack_dynamic_rtx' to operand 0.  If you
     are allocating the space elsewhere, generate code to copy the
     location of the space to operand 0.  In the latter case, you must
     ensure this space gets freed when the corresponding space on the
     main stack is free.

     Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the
     subtraction.  Some machines require other operations such as stack
     probes or maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit
     those operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.

'check_stack'
     If stack checking (*note Stack Checking::) cannot be done on your
     system by probing the stack, define this pattern to perform the
     needed check and signal an error if the stack has overflowed.  The
     single operand is the address in the stack farthest from the
     current stack pointer that you need to validate.  Normally, on
     platforms where this pattern is needed, you would obtain the stack
     limit from a global or thread-specific variable or register.

'probe_stack_address'
     If stack checking (*note Stack Checking::) can be done on your
     system by probing the stack but without the need to actually access
     it, define this pattern and signal an error if the stack has
     overflowed.  The single operand is the memory address in the stack
     that needs to be probed.

'probe_stack'
     If stack checking (*note Stack Checking::) can be done on your
     system by probing the stack but doing it with a "store zero"
     instruction is not valid or optimal, define this pattern to do the
     probing differently and signal an error if the stack has
     overflowed.  The single operand is the memory reference in the
     stack that needs to be probed.

'nonlocal_goto'
     Emit code to generate a non-local goto, e.g., a jump from one
     function to a label in an outer function.  This pattern has four
     arguments, each representing a value to be used in the jump.  The
     first argument is to be loaded into the frame pointer, the second
     is the address to branch to (code to dispatch to the actual label),
     the third is the address of a location where the stack is saved,
     and the last is the address of the label, to be placed in the
     location for the incoming static chain.

     On most machines you need not define this pattern, since GCC will
     already generate the correct code, which is to load the frame
     pointer and static chain, restore the stack (using the
     'restore_stack_nonlocal' pattern, if defined), and jump indirectly
     to the dispatcher.  You need only define this pattern if this code
     will not work on your machine.

'nonlocal_goto_receiver'
     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the target of a
     nonlocal goto after the code already generated by GCC.  You will
     not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical reason why you
     might need this pattern is if some value, such as a pointer to a
     global table, must be restored when the frame pointer is restored.
     Note that a nonlocal goto only occurs within a unit-of-translation,
     so a global table pointer that is shared by all functions of a
     given module need not be restored.  There are no arguments.

'exception_receiver'
     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of an
     exception handler that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal goto.
     You will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical
     reason why you might need this pattern is if some value, such as a
     pointer to a global table, must be restored after control flow is
     branched to the handler of an exception.  There are no arguments.

'builtin_setjmp_setup'
     This pattern, if defined, contains additional code needed to
     initialize the 'jmp_buf'.  You will not normally need to define
     this pattern.  A typical reason why you might need this pattern is
     if some value, such as a pointer to a global table, must be
     restored.  Though it is preferred that the pointer value be
     recalculated if possible (given the address of a label for
     instance).  The single argument is a pointer to the 'jmp_buf'.
     Note that the buffer is five words long and that the first three
     are normally used by the generic mechanism.

'builtin_setjmp_receiver'
     This pattern, if defined, contains code needed at the site of a
     built-in setjmp that isn't needed at the site of a nonlocal goto.
     You will not normally need to define this pattern.  A typical
     reason why you might need this pattern is if some value, such as a
     pointer to a global table, must be restored.  It takes one
     argument, which is the label to which builtin_longjmp transferred
     control; this pattern may be emitted at a small offset from that
     label.

'builtin_longjmp'
     This pattern, if defined, performs the entire action of the
     longjmp.  You will not normally need to define this pattern unless
     you also define 'builtin_setjmp_setup'.  The single argument is a
     pointer to the 'jmp_buf'.

'eh_return'
     This pattern, if defined, affects the way '__builtin_eh_return',
     and thence the call frame exception handling library routines, are
     built.  It is intended to handle non-trivial actions needed along
     the abnormal return path.

     The address of the exception handler to which the function should
     return is passed as operand to this pattern.  It will normally need
     to copied by the pattern to some special register or memory
     location.  If the pattern needs to determine the location of the
     target call frame in order to do so, it may use
     'EH_RETURN_STACKADJ_RTX', if defined; it will have already been
     assigned.

     If this pattern is not defined, the default action will be to
     simply copy the return address to 'EH_RETURN_HANDLER_RTX'.  Either
     that macro or this pattern needs to be defined if call frame
     exception handling is to be used.

'prologue'
     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for entry to a function.  The
     function entry is responsible for setting up the stack frame,
     initializing the frame pointer register, saving callee saved
     registers, etc.

     Using a prologue pattern is generally preferred over defining
     'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' to emit assembly code for the
     prologue.

     The 'prologue' pattern is particularly useful for targets which
     perform instruction scheduling.

'window_save'
     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for a register window save.  It
     should be defined if the target machine has register windows but
     the window events are decoupled from calls to subroutines.  The
     canonical example is the SPARC architecture.

'epilogue'
     This pattern emits RTL for exit from a function.  The function exit
     is responsible for deallocating the stack frame, restoring callee
     saved registers and emitting the return instruction.

     Using an epilogue pattern is generally preferred over defining
     'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to emit assembly code for the
     epilogue.

     The 'epilogue' pattern is particularly useful for targets which
     perform instruction scheduling or which have delay slots for their
     return instruction.

'sibcall_epilogue'
     This pattern, if defined, emits RTL for exit from a function
     without the final branch back to the calling function.  This
     pattern will be emitted before any sibling call (aka tail call)
     sites.

     The 'sibcall_epilogue' pattern must not clobber any arguments used
     for parameter passing or any stack slots for arguments passed to
     the current function.

'trap'
     This pattern, if defined, signals an error, typically by causing
     some kind of signal to be raised.  Among other places, it is used
     by the Java front end to signal 'invalid array index' exceptions.

'ctrapMM4'
     Conditional trap instruction.  Operand 0 is a piece of RTL which
     performs a comparison, and operands 1 and 2 are the arms of the
     comparison.  Operand 3 is the trap code, an integer.

     A typical 'ctrap' pattern looks like

          (define_insn "ctrapsi4"
            [(trap_if (match_operator 0 "trap_operator"
                       [(match_operand 1 "register_operand")
                        (match_operand 2 "immediate_operand")])
                      (match_operand 3 "const_int_operand" "i"))]
            ""
            "...")

'prefetch'

     This pattern, if defined, emits code for a non-faulting data
     prefetch instruction.  Operand 0 is the address of the memory to
     prefetch.  Operand 1 is a constant 1 if the prefetch is preparing
     for a write to the memory address, or a constant 0 otherwise.
     Operand 2 is the expected degree of temporal locality of the data
     and is a value between 0 and 3, inclusive; 0 means that the data
     has no temporal locality, so it need not be left in the cache after
     the access; 3 means that the data has a high degree of temporal
     locality and should be left in all levels of cache possible; 1 and
     2 mean, respectively, a low or moderate degree of temporal
     locality.

     Targets that do not support write prefetches or locality hints can
     ignore the values of operands 1 and 2.

'blockage'

     This pattern defines a pseudo insn that prevents the instruction
     scheduler and other passes from moving instructions and using
     register equivalences across the boundary defined by the blockage
     insn.  This needs to be an UNSPEC_VOLATILE pattern or a volatile
     ASM.

'memory_barrier'

     If the target memory model is not fully synchronous, then this
     pattern should be defined to an instruction that orders both loads
     and stores before the instruction with respect to loads and stores
     after the instruction.  This pattern has no operands.

'sync_compare_and_swapMODE'

     This pattern, if defined, emits code for an atomic compare-and-swap
     operation.  Operand 1 is the memory on which the atomic operation
     is performed.  Operand 2 is the "old" value to be compared against
     the current contents of the memory location.  Operand 3 is the
     "new" value to store in the memory if the compare succeeds.
     Operand 0 is the result of the operation; it should contain the
     contents of the memory before the operation.  If the compare
     succeeds, this should obviously be a copy of operand 2.

     This pattern must show that both operand 0 and operand 1 are
     modified.

     This pattern must issue any memory barrier instructions such that
     all memory operations before the atomic operation occur before the
     atomic operation and all memory operations after the atomic
     operation occur after the atomic operation.

     For targets where the success or failure of the compare-and-swap
     operation is available via the status flags, it is possible to
     avoid a separate compare operation and issue the subsequent branch
     or store-flag operation immediately after the compare-and-swap.  To
     this end, GCC will look for a 'MODE_CC' set in the output of
     'sync_compare_and_swapMODE'; if the machine description includes
     such a set, the target should also define special 'cbranchcc4'
     and/or 'cstorecc4' instructions.  GCC will then be able to take the
     destination of the 'MODE_CC' set and pass it to the 'cbranchcc4' or
     'cstorecc4' pattern as the first operand of the comparison (the
     second will be '(const_int 0)').

     For targets where the operating system may provide support for this
     operation via library calls, the 'sync_compare_and_swap_optab' may
     be initialized to a function with the same interface as the
     '__sync_val_compare_and_swap_N' built-in.  If the entire set of
     __SYNC builtins are supported via library calls, the target can
     initialize all of the optabs at once with 'init_sync_libfuncs'.
     For the purposes of C++11 'std::atomic::is_lock_free', it is
     assumed that these library calls do _not_ use any kind of
     interruptable locking.

'sync_addMODE', 'sync_subMODE'
'sync_iorMODE', 'sync_andMODE'
'sync_xorMODE', 'sync_nandMODE'

     These patterns emit code for an atomic operation on memory.
     Operand 0 is the memory on which the atomic operation is performed.
     Operand 1 is the second operand to the binary operator.

     This pattern must issue any memory barrier instructions such that
     all memory operations before the atomic operation occur before the
     atomic operation and all memory operations after the atomic
     operation occur after the atomic operation.

     If these patterns are not defined, the operation will be
     constructed from a compare-and-swap operation, if defined.

'sync_old_addMODE', 'sync_old_subMODE'
'sync_old_iorMODE', 'sync_old_andMODE'
'sync_old_xorMODE', 'sync_old_nandMODE'

     These patterns emit code for an atomic operation on memory, and
     return the value that the memory contained before the operation.
     Operand 0 is the result value, operand 1 is the memory on which the
     atomic operation is performed, and operand 2 is the second operand
     to the binary operator.

     This pattern must issue any memory barrier instructions such that
     all memory operations before the atomic operation occur before the
     atomic operation and all memory operations after the atomic
     operation occur after the atomic operation.

     If these patterns are not defined, the operation will be
     constructed from a compare-and-swap operation, if defined.

'sync_new_addMODE', 'sync_new_subMODE'
'sync_new_iorMODE', 'sync_new_andMODE'
'sync_new_xorMODE', 'sync_new_nandMODE'

     These patterns are like their 'sync_old_OP' counterparts, except
     that they return the value that exists in the memory location after
     the operation, rather than before the operation.

'sync_lock_test_and_setMODE'

     This pattern takes two forms, based on the capabilities of the
     target.  In either case, operand 0 is the result of the operand,
     operand 1 is the memory on which the atomic operation is performed,
     and operand 2 is the value to set in the lock.

     In the ideal case, this operation is an atomic exchange operation,
     in which the previous value in memory operand is copied into the
     result operand, and the value operand is stored in the memory
     operand.

     For less capable targets, any value operand that is not the
     constant 1 should be rejected with 'FAIL'.  In this case the target
     may use an atomic test-and-set bit operation.  The result operand
     should contain 1 if the bit was previously set and 0 if the bit was
     previously clear.  The true contents of the memory operand are
     implementation defined.

     This pattern must issue any memory barrier instructions such that
     the pattern as a whole acts as an acquire barrier, that is all
     memory operations after the pattern do not occur until the lock is
     acquired.

     If this pattern is not defined, the operation will be constructed
     from a compare-and-swap operation, if defined.

'sync_lock_releaseMODE'

     This pattern, if defined, releases a lock set by
     'sync_lock_test_and_setMODE'.  Operand 0 is the memory that
     contains the lock; operand 1 is the value to store in the lock.

     If the target doesn't implement full semantics for
     'sync_lock_test_and_setMODE', any value operand which is not the
     constant 0 should be rejected with 'FAIL', and the true contents of
     the memory operand are implementation defined.

     This pattern must issue any memory barrier instructions such that
     the pattern as a whole acts as a release barrier, that is the lock
     is released only after all previous memory operations have
     completed.

     If this pattern is not defined, then a 'memory_barrier' pattern
     will be emitted, followed by a store of the value to the memory
     operand.

'atomic_compare_and_swapMODE'
     This pattern, if defined, emits code for an atomic compare-and-swap
     operation with memory model semantics.  Operand 2 is the memory on
     which the atomic operation is performed.  Operand 0 is an output
     operand which is set to true or false based on whether the
     operation succeeded.  Operand 1 is an output operand which is set
     to the contents of the memory before the operation was attempted.
     Operand 3 is the value that is expected to be in memory.  Operand 4
     is the value to put in memory if the expected value is found there.
     Operand 5 is set to 1 if this compare and swap is to be treated as
     a weak operation.  Operand 6 is the memory model to be used if the
     operation is a success.  Operand 7 is the memory model to be used
     if the operation fails.

     If memory referred to in operand 2 contains the value in operand 3,
     then operand 4 is stored in memory pointed to by operand 2 and
     fencing based on the memory model in operand 6 is issued.

     If memory referred to in operand 2 does not contain the value in
     operand 3, then fencing based on the memory model in operand 7 is
     issued.

     If a target does not support weak compare-and-swap operations, or
     the port elects not to implement weak operations, the argument in
     operand 5 can be ignored.  Note a strong implementation must be
     provided.

     If this pattern is not provided, the '__atomic_compare_exchange'
     built-in functions will utilize the legacy 'sync_compare_and_swap'
     pattern with an '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST' memory model.

'atomic_loadMODE'
     This pattern implements an atomic load operation with memory model
     semantics.  Operand 1 is the memory address being loaded from.
     Operand 0 is the result of the load.  Operand 2 is the memory model
     to be used for the load operation.

     If not present, the '__atomic_load' built-in function will either
     resort to a normal load with memory barriers, or a compare-and-swap
     operation if a normal load would not be atomic.

'atomic_storeMODE'
     This pattern implements an atomic store operation with memory model
     semantics.  Operand 0 is the memory address being stored to.
     Operand 1 is the value to be written.  Operand 2 is the memory
     model to be used for the operation.

     If not present, the '__atomic_store' built-in function will attempt
     to perform a normal store and surround it with any required memory
     fences.  If the store would not be atomic, then an
     '__atomic_exchange' is attempted with the result being ignored.

'atomic_exchangeMODE'
     This pattern implements an atomic exchange operation with memory
     model semantics.  Operand 1 is the memory location the operation is
     performed on.  Operand 0 is an output operand which is set to the
     original value contained in the memory pointed to by operand 1.
     Operand 2 is the value to be stored.  Operand 3 is the memory model
     to be used.

     If this pattern is not present, the built-in function
     '__atomic_exchange' will attempt to preform the operation with a
     compare and swap loop.

'atomic_addMODE', 'atomic_subMODE'
'atomic_orMODE', 'atomic_andMODE'
'atomic_xorMODE', 'atomic_nandMODE'

     These patterns emit code for an atomic operation on memory with
     memory model semantics.  Operand 0 is the memory on which the
     atomic operation is performed.  Operand 1 is the second operand to
     the binary operator.  Operand 2 is the memory model to be used by
     the operation.

     If these patterns are not defined, attempts will be made to use
     legacy 'sync' patterns, or equivalent patterns which return a
     result.  If none of these are available a compare-and-swap loop
     will be used.

'atomic_fetch_addMODE', 'atomic_fetch_subMODE'
'atomic_fetch_orMODE', 'atomic_fetch_andMODE'
'atomic_fetch_xorMODE', 'atomic_fetch_nandMODE'

     These patterns emit code for an atomic operation on memory with
     memory model semantics, and return the original value.  Operand 0
     is an output operand which contains the value of the memory
     location before the operation was performed.  Operand 1 is the
     memory on which the atomic operation is performed.  Operand 2 is
     the second operand to the binary operator.  Operand 3 is the memory
     model to be used by the operation.

     If these patterns are not defined, attempts will be made to use
     legacy 'sync' patterns.  If none of these are available a
     compare-and-swap loop will be used.

'atomic_add_fetchMODE', 'atomic_sub_fetchMODE'
'atomic_or_fetchMODE', 'atomic_and_fetchMODE'
'atomic_xor_fetchMODE', 'atomic_nand_fetchMODE'

     These patterns emit code for an atomic operation on memory with
     memory model semantics and return the result after the operation is
     performed.  Operand 0 is an output operand which contains the value
     after the operation.  Operand 1 is the memory on which the atomic
     operation is performed.  Operand 2 is the second operand to the
     binary operator.  Operand 3 is the memory model to be used by the
     operation.

     If these patterns are not defined, attempts will be made to use
     legacy 'sync' patterns, or equivalent patterns which return the
     result before the operation followed by the arithmetic operation
     required to produce the result.  If none of these are available a
     compare-and-swap loop will be used.

'atomic_test_and_set'

     This pattern emits code for '__builtin_atomic_test_and_set'.
     Operand 0 is an output operand which is set to true if the previous
     previous contents of the byte was "set", and false otherwise.
     Operand 1 is the 'QImode' memory to be modified.  Operand 2 is the
     memory model to be used.

     The specific value that defines "set" is implementation defined,
     and is normally based on what is performed by the native atomic
     test and set instruction.

'mem_thread_fenceMODE'
     This pattern emits code required to implement a thread fence with
     memory model semantics.  Operand 0 is the memory model to be used.

     If this pattern is not specified, all memory models except
     '__ATOMIC_RELAXED' will result in issuing a 'sync_synchronize'
     barrier pattern.

'mem_signal_fenceMODE'
     This pattern emits code required to implement a signal fence with
     memory model semantics.  Operand 0 is the memory model to be used.

     This pattern should impact the compiler optimizers the same way
     that mem_signal_fence does, but it does not need to issue any
     barrier instructions.

     If this pattern is not specified, all memory models except
     '__ATOMIC_RELAXED' will result in issuing a 'sync_synchronize'
     barrier pattern.

'get_thread_pointerMODE'
'set_thread_pointerMODE'
     These patterns emit code that reads/sets the TLS thread pointer.
     Currently, these are only needed if the target needs to support the
     '__builtin_thread_pointer' and '__builtin_set_thread_pointer'
     builtins.

     The get/set patterns have a single output/input operand
     respectively, with MODE intended to be 'Pmode'.

'stack_protect_set'

     This pattern, if defined, moves a 'ptr_mode' value from the memory
     in operand 1 to the memory in operand 0 without leaving the value
     in a register afterward.  This is to avoid leaking the value some
     place that an attacker might use to rewrite the stack guard slot
     after having clobbered it.

     If this pattern is not defined, then a plain move pattern is
     generated.

'stack_protect_test'

     This pattern, if defined, compares a 'ptr_mode' value from the
     memory in operand 1 with the memory in operand 0 without leaving
     the value in a register afterward and branches to operand 2 if the
     values were equal.

     If this pattern is not defined, then a plain compare pattern and
     conditional branch pattern is used.

'clear_cache'

     This pattern, if defined, flushes the instruction cache for a
     region of memory.  The region is bounded to by the Pmode pointers
     in operand 0 inclusive and operand 1 exclusive.

     If this pattern is not defined, a call to the library function
     '__clear_cache' is used.

16.10 When the Order of Patterns Matters
========================================

Sometimes an insn can match more than one instruction pattern.  Then the
pattern that appears first in the machine description is the one used.
Therefore, more specific patterns (patterns that will match fewer
things) and faster instructions (those that will produce better code
when they do match) should usually go first in the description.

 In some cases the effect of ordering the patterns can be used to hide a
pattern when it is not valid.  For example, the 68000 has an instruction
for converting a fullword to floating point and another for converting a
byte to floating point.  An instruction converting an integer to
floating point could match either one.  We put the pattern to convert
the fullword first to make sure that one will be used rather than the
other.  (Otherwise a large integer might be generated as a single-byte
immediate quantity, which would not work.)  Instead of using this
pattern ordering it would be possible to make the pattern for
convert-a-byte smart enough to deal properly with any constant value.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Dependent Patterns,  Next: Jump Patterns,  Prev: Pattern Ordering,  Up: Machine Desc

16.11 Interdependence of Patterns
=================================

In some cases machines support instructions identical except for the
machine mode of one or more operands.  For example, there may be
"sign-extend halfword" and "sign-extend byte" instructions whose
patterns are

     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
          (extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 ...)))

     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
          (extend:SI (match_operand:QI 1 ...)))

Constant integers do not specify a machine mode, so an instruction to
extend a constant value could match either pattern.  The pattern it
actually will match is the one that appears first in the file.  For
correct results, this must be the one for the widest possible mode
('HImode', here).  If the pattern matches the 'QImode' instruction, the
results will be incorrect if the constant value does not actually fit
that mode.

 Such instructions to extend constants are rarely generated because they
are optimized away, but they do occasionally happen in nonoptimized
compilations.

 If a constraint in a pattern allows a constant, the reload pass may
replace a register with a constant permitted by the constraint in some
cases.  Similarly for memory references.  Because of this substitution,
you should not provide separate patterns for increment and decrement
instructions.  Instead, they should be generated from the same pattern
that supports register-register add insns by examining the operands and
generating the appropriate machine instruction.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Jump Patterns,  Next: Looping Patterns,  Prev: Dependent Patterns,  Up: Machine Desc

16.12 Defining Jump Instruction Patterns
========================================

GCC does not assume anything about how the machine realizes jumps.  The
machine description should define a single pattern, usually a
'define_expand', which expands to all the required insns.

 Usually, this would be a comparison insn to set the condition code and
a separate branch insn testing the condition code and branching or not
according to its value.  For many machines, however, separating compares
and branches is limiting, which is why the more flexible approach with
one 'define_expand' is used in GCC. The machine description becomes
clearer for architectures that have compare-and-branch instructions but
no condition code.  It also works better when different sets of
comparison operators are supported by different kinds of conditional
branches (e.g.  integer vs.  floating-point), or by conditional branches
with respect to conditional stores.

 Two separate insns are always used if the machine description
represents a condition code register using the legacy RTL expression
'(cc0)', and on most machines that use a separate condition code
register (*note Condition Code::).  For machines that use '(cc0)', in
fact, the set and use of the condition code must be separate and
adjacent(1), thus allowing flags in 'cc_status' to be used (*note
Condition Code::) and so that the comparison and branch insns could be
located from each other by using the functions 'prev_cc0_setter' and
'next_cc0_user'.

 Even in this case having a single entry point for conditional branches
is advantageous, because it handles equally well the case where a single
comparison instruction records the results of both signed and unsigned
comparison of the given operands (with the branch insns coming in
distinct signed and unsigned flavors) as in the x86 or SPARC, and the
case where there are distinct signed and unsigned compare instructions
and only one set of conditional branch instructions as in the PowerPC.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) 'note' insns can separate them, though.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Looping Patterns,  Next: Insn Canonicalizations,  Prev: Jump Patterns,  Up: Machine Desc

16.13 Defining Looping Instruction Patterns
===========================================

Some machines have special jump instructions that can be utilized to
make loops more efficient.  A common example is the 68000 'dbra'
instruction which performs a decrement of a register and a branch if the
result was greater than zero.  Other machines, in particular digital
signal processors (DSPs), have special block repeat instructions to
provide low-overhead loop support.  For example, the TI TMS320C3x/C4x
DSPs have a block repeat instruction that loads special registers to
mark the top and end of a loop and to count the number of loop
iterations.  This avoids the need for fetching and executing a
'dbra'-like instruction and avoids pipeline stalls associated with the
jump.

 GCC has three special named patterns to support low overhead looping.
They are 'decrement_and_branch_until_zero', 'doloop_begin', and
'doloop_end'.  The first pattern, 'decrement_and_branch_until_zero', is
not emitted during RTL generation but may be emitted during the
instruction combination phase.  This requires the assistance of the loop
optimizer, using information collected during strength reduction, to
reverse a loop to count down to zero.  Some targets also require the
loop optimizer to add a 'REG_NONNEG' note to indicate that the iteration
count is always positive.  This is needed if the target performs a
signed loop termination test.  For example, the 68000 uses a pattern
similar to the following for its 'dbra' instruction:

     (define_insn "decrement_and_branch_until_zero"
       [(set (pc)
             (if_then_else
               (ge (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "+d*am")
                            (const_int -1))
                   (const_int 0))
               (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))
               (pc)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
             (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                      (const_int -1)))]
       "find_reg_note (insn, REG_NONNEG, 0)"
       "...")

 Note that since the insn is both a jump insn and has an output, it must
deal with its own reloads, hence the 'm' constraints.  Also note that
since this insn is generated by the instruction combination phase
combining two sequential insns together into an implicit parallel insn,
the iteration counter needs to be biased by the same amount as the
decrement operation, in this case -1.  Note that the following similar
pattern will not be matched by the combiner.

     (define_insn "decrement_and_branch_until_zero"
       [(set (pc)
             (if_then_else
               (ge (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "+d*am")
                   (const_int 1))
               (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))
               (pc)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
             (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                      (const_int -1)))]
       "find_reg_note (insn, REG_NONNEG, 0)"
       "...")

 The other two special looping patterns, 'doloop_begin' and
'doloop_end', are emitted by the loop optimizer for certain well-behaved
loops with a finite number of loop iterations using information
collected during strength reduction.

 The 'doloop_end' pattern describes the actual looping instruction (or
the implicit looping operation) and the 'doloop_begin' pattern is an
optional companion pattern that can be used for initialization needed
for some low-overhead looping instructions.

 Note that some machines require the actual looping instruction to be
emitted at the top of the loop (e.g., the TMS320C3x/C4x DSPs).  Emitting
the true RTL for a looping instruction at the top of the loop can cause
problems with flow analysis.  So instead, a dummy 'doloop' insn is
emitted at the end of the loop.  The machine dependent reorg pass checks
for the presence of this 'doloop' insn and then searches back to the top
of the loop, where it inserts the true looping insn (provided there are
no instructions in the loop which would cause problems).  Any additional
labels can be emitted at this point.  In addition, if the desired
special iteration counter register was not allocated, this machine
dependent reorg pass could emit a traditional compare and jump
instruction pair.

 The essential difference between the 'decrement_and_branch_until_zero'
and the 'doloop_end' patterns is that the loop optimizer allocates an
additional pseudo register for the latter as an iteration counter.  This
pseudo register cannot be used within the loop (i.e., general induction
variables cannot be derived from it), however, in many cases the loop
induction variable may become redundant and removed by the flow pass.

16.14 Canonicalization of Instructions
======================================

There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent an
operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation is
most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and multiply-accumulate
instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts to convert these
multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form to reduce the
number of insn patterns required.

 In addition to algebraic simplifications, following canonicalizations
are performed:

   * For commutative and comparison operators, a constant is always made
     the second operand.  If a machine only supports a constant as the
     second operand, only patterns that match a constant in the second
     operand need be supplied.

   * For associative operators, a sequence of operators will always
     chain to the left; for instance, only the left operand of an
     integer 'plus' can itself be a 'plus'.  'and', 'ior', 'xor',
     'plus', 'mult', 'smin', 'smax', 'umin', and 'umax' are associative
     when applied to integers, and sometimes to floating-point.

   * For these operators, if only one operand is a 'neg', 'not', 'mult',
     'plus', or 'minus' expression, it will be the first operand.

   * In combinations of 'neg', 'mult', 'plus', and 'minus', the 'neg'
     operations (if any) will be moved inside the operations as far as
     possible.  For instance, '(neg (mult A B))' is canonicalized as
     '(mult (neg A) B)', but '(plus (mult (neg B) C) A)' is
     canonicalized as '(minus A (mult B C))'.

   * For the 'compare' operator, a constant is always the second operand
     if the first argument is a condition code register or '(cc0)'.

   * An operand of 'neg', 'not', 'mult', 'plus', or 'minus' is made the
     first operand under the same conditions as above.

   * '(ltu (plus A B) B)' is converted to '(ltu (plus A B) A)'.
     Likewise with 'geu' instead of 'ltu'.

   * '(minus X (const_int N))' is converted to '(plus X (const_int
     -N))'.

   * Within address computations (i.e., inside 'mem'), a left shift is
     converted into the appropriate multiplication by a power of two.

   * De Morgan's Law is used to move bitwise negation inside a bitwise
     logical-and or logical-or operation.  If this results in only one
     operand being a 'not' expression, it will be the first one.

     A machine that has an instruction that performs a bitwise
     logical-and of one operand with the bitwise negation of the other
     should specify the pattern for that instruction as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (and:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (match_operand:M 2 ...)))]
            "..."
            "...")

     Similarly, a pattern for a "NAND" instruction should be written

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (ior:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (not:M (match_operand:M 2 ...))))]
            "..."
            "...")

     In both cases, it is not necessary to include patterns for the many
     logically equivalent RTL expressions.

   * The only possible RTL expressions involving both bitwise
     exclusive-or and bitwise negation are '(xor:M X Y)' and '(not:M
     (xor:M X Y))'.

   * The sum of three items, one of which is a constant, will only
     appear in the form

          (plus:M (plus:M X Y) CONSTANT)

   * Equality comparisons of a group of bits (usually a single bit) with
     zero will be written using 'zero_extract' rather than the
     equivalent 'and' or 'sign_extract' operations.

   * '(sign_extend:M1 (mult:M2 (sign_extend:M2 X) (sign_extend:M2 Y)))'
     is converted to '(mult:M1 (sign_extend:M1 X) (sign_extend:M1 Y))',
     and likewise for 'zero_extend'.

   * '(sign_extend:M1 (mult:M2 (ashiftrt:M2 X S) (sign_extend:M2 Y)))'
     is converted to '(mult:M1 (sign_extend:M1 (ashiftrt:M2 X S))
     (sign_extend:M1 Y))', and likewise for patterns using 'zero_extend'
     and 'lshiftrt'.  If the second operand of 'mult' is also a shift,
     then that is extended also.  This transformation is only applied
     when it can be proven that the original operation had sufficient
     precision to prevent overflow.

 Further canonicalization rules are defined in the function
'commutative_operand_precedence' in 'gcc/rtlanal.c'.

16.15 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation
================================================

On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL generation
cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL insns can
represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
'define_expand' to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.

 A 'define_expand' is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
'define_insn'; but, unlike the latter, a 'define_expand' is used only
for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.

 A 'define_expand' RTX has four operands:

   * The name.  Each 'define_expand' must have a name, since the only
     use for it is to refer to it by name.

   * The RTL template.  This is a vector of RTL expressions representing
     a sequence of separate instructions.  Unlike 'define_insn', there
     is no implicit surrounding 'PARALLEL'.

   * The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This expression
     is used to express how the availability of this pattern depends on
     subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line options when
     GCC is run.  This is just like the condition of a 'define_insn'
     that has a standard name.  Therefore, the condition (if present)
     may not depend on the data in the insn being matched, but only the
     target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to test these
     conditions during initialization in order to learn exactly which
     named instructions are available in a particular run.

   * The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
     statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated
     from the RTL template.

     Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
     internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate
     RTL insns directly by calling routines such as 'emit_insn', etc.
     Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template.

   * Optionally, a vector containing the values of attributes.  *Note
     Insn Attributes::.

 Every RTL insn emitted by a 'define_expand' must match some
'define_insn' in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler will
crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
it.

 The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.

 A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL
from the pattern, should be described with a 'match_operand' in its
first occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the
operand's predicate into the tables that record such things.  GCC uses
the information to preload the operand into a register if that is
required for valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than
once, subsequent references should use 'match_dup'.

 The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
'define_expand'.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
template with 'match_dup', never with 'match_operand'.  The values of
the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the compiler
when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed within
the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements compute
the values and store them into the appropriate elements of 'operands' so
that 'match_dup' can find them.

 There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation
statements: 'DONE' and 'FAIL'.  Use them with a following semicolon, as
a statement.

'DONE'
     Use the 'DONE' macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
     only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
     those already emitted by explicit calls to 'emit_insn' within the
     preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.

'FAIL'
     Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it
     means that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling
     routines in the compiler will try other strategies for code
     generation using other patterns.

     Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition,
     multiplication, shifting, etc.)  and bit-field ('extv', 'extzv',
     and 'insv') operations.

 If the preparation falls through (invokes neither 'DONE' nor 'FAIL'),
then the 'define_expand' acts like a 'define_insn' in that the RTL
template is used to generate the insn.

 The RTL template is not used for matching, only for generating the
initial insn list.  If the preparation statement always invokes 'DONE'
or 'FAIL', the RTL template may be reduced to a simple list of operands,
such as this example:

     (define_expand "addsi3"
       [(match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
        (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
        (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "")]
       ""
       "
     {
       handle_add (operands[0], operands[1], operands[2]);
       DONE;
     }")

 Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:

     (define_expand "ashlsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (ashift:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
       ""
       "

     {
       if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
           || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) > 3)
         FAIL;
     }")

This example uses 'define_expand' so that it can generate an RTL insn
for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3
but fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it
fails, the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns
(such as, a library call).

 If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a 'define_insn' in
that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension on the 68000) which
makes more use of the power of 'define_expand':

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
             (const_int 0))
        (set (strict_low_part
               (subreg:HI
                 (match_dup 0)
                 0))
             (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
       ""
       "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")

Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This
sequence is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of]
the output operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't
so.  The function 'make_safe_from' copies the 'operands[1]' into a
temporary register if it refers to 'operands[0]'.  It does this by
emitting another RTL insn.

 Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand.
Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by 'and'-ing the result against
a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a 'const_int'
because the constant value is too large to be legitimate on this
machine.  So it must be copied into a register with 'force_reg' and then
the register used in the 'and'.

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (and:SI (subreg:SI
                       (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")
                       0)
                     (match_dup 2)))]
       ""
       "operands[2]
          = force_reg (SImode, GEN_INT (65535)); ")

 _Note:_ If the 'define_expand' is used to serve a standard binary or
unary arithmetic operation or a bit-field operation, then the last insn
it generates must not be a 'code_label', 'barrier' or 'note'.  It must
be an 'insn', 'jump_insn' or 'call_insn'.  If you don't need a real insn
at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
in the compiler.

16.16 Defining How to Split Instructions
========================================

There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern into
multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring delay
slots (*note Delay Slots::) or that have instructions whose output is
not available for multiple cycles (*note Processor pipeline
description::), the compiler phases that optimize these cases need to be
able to move insns into one-instruction delay slots.  However, some
insns may generate more than one machine instruction.  These insns
cannot be placed into a delay slot.

 Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
scheduling.

 The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns are
merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be matched by
some 'define_insn' pattern, the combiner phase attempts to split the
complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually it can
break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.

 The 'define_split' definition tells the compiler how to split a complex
insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:

     (define_split
       [INSN-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION-STATEMENTS")

 INSN-PATTERN is a pattern that needs to be split and CONDITION is the
final condition to be tested, as in a 'define_insn'.  When an insn
matching INSN-PATTERN and satisfying CONDITION is found, it is replaced
in the insn list with the insns given by NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1,
NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2, etc.

 The PREPARATION-STATEMENTS are similar to those statements that are
specified for 'define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and are
executed before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the generated
code or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike those in
'define_expand', however, these statements must not generate any new
pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also must not
allocate any space in the stack frame.

 Patterns are matched against INSN-PATTERN in two different
circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
that it must have been matched by some 'define_insn' and, if
'reload_completed' is nonzero, is known to satisfy the constraints of
that 'define_insn'.  In that case, the new insn patterns must also be
insns that are matched by some 'define_insn' and, if 'reload_completed'
is nonzero, must also satisfy the constraints of those definitions.

 As an example of this usage of 'define_split', consider the following
example from 'a29k.md', which splits a 'sign_extend' from 'HImode' to
'SImode' into a pair of shift insns:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0)
             (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
                        (const_int 16)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
             (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
                          (const_int 16)))]
       "
     { operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")

 When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always
the case that the pattern is _not_ matched by any 'define_insn'.  The
combiner pass first tries to split a single 'set' expression and then
the same 'set' expression inside a 'parallel', but followed by a
'clobber' of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch register.  In these cases,
the combiner expects exactly two new insn patterns to be generated.  It
will verify that these patterns match some 'define_insn' definitions, so
you need not do this test in the 'define_split' (of course, there is no
point in writing a 'define_split' that will never produce insns that
match).

 Here is an example of this use of 'define_split', taken from
'rs6000.md':

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "non_add_cint_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 3)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4)))]
     "
     {
       int low = INTVAL (operands[2]) & 0xffff;
       int high = (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) >> 16;

       if (low & 0x8000)
         high++, low |= 0xffff0000;

       operands[3] = GEN_INT (high << 16);
       operands[4] = GEN_INT (low);
     }")

 Here the predicate 'non_add_cint_operand' matches any 'const_int' that
is _not_ a valid operand of a single add insn.  The add with the smaller
displacement is written so that it can be substituted into the address
of a subsequent operation.

 An example that uses a scratch register, from the same file, generates
an equality comparison of a register and a large constant:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:CC 0 "cc_reg_operand" "")
             (compare:CC (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                         (match_operand:SI 2 "non_short_cint_operand" "")))
        (clobber (match_operand:SI 3 "gen_reg_operand" ""))]
       "find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)
        && (GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == EQ
            || GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == NE)"
       [(set (match_dup 3) (xor:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 4)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (compare:CC (match_dup 3) (match_dup 5)))]
       "
     {
       /* Get the constant we are comparing against, C, and see what it
          looks like sign-extended to 16 bits.  Then see what constant
          could be XOR'ed with C to get the sign-extended value.  */

       int c = INTVAL (operands[2]);
       int sextc = (c << 16) >> 16;
       int xorv = c ^ sextc;

       operands[4] = GEN_INT (xorv);
       operands[5] = GEN_INT (sextc);
     }")

 To avoid confusion, don't write a single 'define_split' that accepts
some insns that match some 'define_insn' as well as some insns that
don't.  Instead, write two separate 'define_split' definitions, one for
the insns that are valid and one for the insns that are not valid.

 The splitter is allowed to split jump instructions into sequence of
jumps or create new jumps in while splitting non-jump instructions.  As
the central flowgraph and branch prediction information needs to be
updated, several restriction apply.

 Splitting of jump instruction into sequence that over by another jump
instruction is always valid, as compiler expect identical behavior of
new jump.  When new sequence contains multiple jump instructions or new
labels, more assistance is needed.  Splitter is required to create only
unconditional jumps, or simple conditional jump instructions.
Additionally it must attach a 'REG_BR_PROB' note to each conditional
jump.  A global variable 'split_branch_probability' holds the
probability of the original branch in case it was a simple conditional
jump, -1 otherwise.  To simplify recomputing of edge frequencies, the
new sequence is required to have only forward jumps to the newly created
labels.

 For the common case where the pattern of a define_split exactly matches
the pattern of a define_insn, use 'define_insn_and_split'.  It looks
like this:

     (define_insn_and_split
       [INSN-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       "OUTPUT-TEMPLATE"
       "SPLIT-CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION-STATEMENTS"
       [INSN-ATTRIBUTES])


 INSN-PATTERN, CONDITION, OUTPUT-TEMPLATE, and INSN-ATTRIBUTES are used
as in 'define_insn'.  The NEW-INSN-PATTERN vector and the
PREPARATION-STATEMENTS are used as in a 'define_split'.  The
SPLIT-CONDITION is also used as in 'define_split', with the additional
behavior that if the condition starts with '&&', the condition used for
the split will be the constructed as a logical "and" of the split
condition with the insn condition.  For example, from i386.md:

     (define_insn_and_split "zero_extendhisi2_and"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
          (zero_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "0")))
        (clobber (reg:CC 17))]
       "TARGET_ZERO_EXTEND_WITH_AND && !optimize_size"
       "#"
       "&& reload_completed"
       [(parallel [(set (match_dup 0)
                        (and:SI (match_dup 0) (const_int 65535)))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       ""
       [(set_attr "type" "alu1")])


 In this case, the actual split condition will be
'TARGET_ZERO_EXTEND_WITH_AND && !optimize_size && reload_completed'.

 The 'define_insn_and_split' construction provides exactly the same
functionality as two separate 'define_insn' and 'define_split' patterns.
It exists for compactness, and as a maintenance tool to prevent having
to ensure the two patterns' templates match.

16.17 Including Patterns in Machine Descriptions.
=================================================

The 'include' pattern tells the compiler tools where to look for
patterns that are in files other than in the file '.md'.  This is used
only at build time and there is no preprocessing allowed.

 It looks like:


     (include
       PATHNAME)

 For example:


     (include "filestuff")


 Where PATHNAME is a string that specifies the location of the file,
specifies the include file to be in 'gcc/config/target/filestuff'.  The
directory 'gcc/config/target' is regarded as the default directory.

 Machine descriptions may be split up into smaller more manageable
subsections and placed into subdirectories.

 By specifying:


     (include "BOGUS/filestuff")


 the include file is specified to be in
'gcc/config/TARGET/BOGUS/filestuff'.

 Specifying an absolute path for the include file such as;

     (include "/u2/BOGUS/filestuff")

 is permitted but is not encouraged.

16.17.1 RTL Generation Tool Options for Directory Search
--------------------------------------------------------

The '-IDIR' option specifies directories to search for machine
descriptions.  For example:


     genrecog -I/p1/abc/proc1 -I/p2/abcd/pro2 target.md


 Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system
machine definition file, substituting your own version, since these
directories are searched before the default machine description file
directories.  If you use more than one '-I' option, the directories are
scanned in left-to-right order; the standard default directory come
after.

16.18 Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers
==========================================

In addition to instruction patterns the 'md' file may contain
definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.

 The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the
data flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For
example, sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be
combined even though the second one does not appear to use a register
computed in the first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can
detect such opportunities.

 There are two forms of peephole definitions that may be used.  The
original 'define_peephole' is run at assembly output time to match insns
and substitute assembly text.  Use of 'define_peephole' is deprecated.

 A newer 'define_peephole2' matches insns and substitutes new insns.
The 'peephole2' pass is run after register allocation but before
scheduling, which may result in much better code for targets that do
scheduling.

* define_peephole2::    RTL to RTL Peephole Optimizers


File: gccint.info,  Node: define_peephole,  Next: define_peephole2,  Up: Peephole Definitions

16.18.1 RTL to Text Peephole Optimizers
---------------------------------------

A definition looks like this:

     (define_peephole
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "CONDITION"
       "TEMPLATE"
       "OPTIONAL-INSN-ATTRIBUTES")

The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
it must obey the same rules as in a 'define_insn'.

 In this skeleton, INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on are patterns to match
consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
INSN-PATTERN-1 matches the first one, INSN-PATTERN-2 matches the next,
and so on.

 Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
'define_insn'.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just before
code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which would
match a peephole but no 'define_insn' will cause a crash in code
generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
stages.

 The operands of the insns are matched with 'match_operands',
'match_operator', and 'match_dup', as usual.  What is not usual is that
the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the definition.
So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by using
'match_operand' in one insn and 'match_dup' in the other.

 The operand constraints used in 'match_operand' patterns do not have
any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will be
validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough to
apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches but the
constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.

 It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole; or
you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the criteria
previously tested.

 Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the CONDITION is
checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether
to perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
CONDITION is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
patterns.

 The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register
allocation is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check
which operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by
looking at the operands.

 The way to refer to the operands in CONDITION is to write 'operands[I]'
for operand number I (as matched by '(match_operand I ...)').  Use the
variable 'insn' to refer to the last of the insns being matched; use
'prev_active_insn' to find the preceding insns.

 When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
CONDITION to match only when the intermediate results are not used
elsewhere.  Use the C expression 'dead_or_set_p (INSN, OP)', where INSN
is the insn in which you expect the value to be used for the last time
(from the value of 'insn', together with use of 'prev_nonnote_insn'),
and OP is the intermediate value (from 'operands[I]').

 Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with
one new insn.  The TEMPLATE controls ultimate output of assembler code
for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
'define_insn'.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones used
in matching the original sequence of insns.

 The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match any
of the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even have
an opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition itself
serves as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.

 Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being output,
so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in any way.

 Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:

     (define_peephole
       [(set (reg:SI 15) (plus:SI (reg:SI 15) (const_int 4)))
        (set (match_operand:DF 0 "register_operand" "=f")
             (match_operand:DF 1 "register_operand" "ad"))]
       "FP_REG_P (operands[0]) && ! FP_REG_P (operands[1])"
     {
       rtx xoperands[2];
       xoperands[1] = gen_rtx_REG (SImode, REGNO (operands[1]) + 1);
     #ifdef MOTOROLA
       output_asm_insn ("move.l %1,(sp)", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn ("move.l %1,-(sp)", operands);
       return "fmove.d (sp)+,%0";
     #else
       output_asm_insn ("movel %1,sp@", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn ("movel %1,sp@-", operands);
       return "fmoved sp@+,%0";
     #endif
     })

 The effect of this optimization is to change

     jbsr _foobar
     addql #4,sp
     movel d1,sp@-
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

into

     jbsr _foobar
     movel d1,sp@
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

 INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on look _almost_ like the second operand of
'define_insn'.  There is one important difference: the second operand of
'define_insn' consists of one or more RTX's enclosed in square brackets.
Usually, there is only one: then the same action can be written as an
element of a 'define_peephole'.  But when there are multiple actions in
a 'define_insn', they are implicitly enclosed in a 'parallel'.  Then you
must explicitly write the 'parallel', and the square brackets within it,
in the 'define_peephole'.  Thus, if an insn pattern looks like this,

     (define_insn "divmodsi4"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
             (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
             (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))]
       "TARGET_68020"
       "divsl%.l %2,%3:%0")

then the way to mention this insn in a peephole is as follows:

     (define_peephole
       [...
        (parallel
         [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
               (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                       (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
          (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
               (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))])
        ...]
       ...)

16.18.2 RTL to RTL Peephole Optimizers
--------------------------------------

The 'define_peephole2' definition tells the compiler how to substitute
one sequence of instructions for another sequence, what additional
scratch registers may be needed and what their lifetimes must be.

     (define_peephole2
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION-STATEMENTS")

 The definition is almost identical to 'define_split' (*note Insn
Splitting::) except that the pattern to match is not a single
instruction, but a sequence of instructions.

 It is possible to request additional scratch registers for use in the
output template.  If appropriate registers are not free, the pattern
will simply not match.

 Scratch registers are requested with a 'match_scratch' pattern at the
top level of the input pattern.  The allocated register (initially) will
be dead at the point requested within the original sequence.  If the
scratch is used at more than a single point, a 'match_dup' pattern at
the top level of the input pattern marks the last position in the input
sequence at which the register must be available.

 Here is an example from the IA-32 machine description:

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 2 "r")
        (parallel [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
                        (match_operator:SI 3 "arith_or_logical_operator"
                          [(match_dup 0)
                           (match_operand:SI 1 "memory_operand" "")]))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       "! optimize_size && ! TARGET_READ_MODIFY"
       [(set (match_dup 2) (match_dup 1))
        (parallel [(set (match_dup 0)
                        (match_op_dup 3 [(match_dup 0) (match_dup 2)]))
                   (clobber (reg:CC 17))])]
       "")

This pattern tries to split a load from its use in the hopes that we'll
be able to schedule around the memory load latency.  It allocates a
single 'SImode' register of class 'GENERAL_REGS' ('"r"') that needs to
be live only at the point just before the arithmetic.

 A real example requiring extended scratch lifetimes is harder to come
by, so here's a silly made-up example:

     (define_peephole2
       [(match_scratch:SI 4 "r")
        (set (match_operand:SI 0 "" "") (match_operand:SI 1 "" ""))
        (set (match_operand:SI 2 "" "") (match_dup 1))
        (match_dup 4)
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "" "") (match_dup 1))]
       "/* determine 1 does not overlap 0 and 2 */"
       [(set (match_dup 4) (match_dup 1))
        (set (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4))
        (set (match_dup 2) (match_dup 4))
        (set (match_dup 3) (match_dup 4))]
       "")

If we had not added the '(match_dup 4)' in the middle of the input
sequence, it might have been the case that the register we chose at the
beginning of the sequence is killed by the first or second 'set'.

16.19 Instruction Attributes
============================

In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target
machine, the 'md' file also defines a group of "attributes" and a set of
values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each
attribute.  One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn has
on the machine's condition code.  This attribute can then be used by
'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to track the condition codes.

16.19.1 Defining Attributes and their Values
--------------------------------------------

The 'define_attr' expression is used to define each attribute required
by the target machine.  It looks like:

     (define_attr NAME LIST-OF-VALUES DEFAULT)

 NAME is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.
Some attributes are used in a special way by the rest of the compiler.
The 'enabled' attribute can be used to conditionally enable or disable
insn alternatives (*note Disable Insn Alternatives::).  The 'predicable'
attribute, together with a suitable 'define_cond_exec' (*note
Conditional Execution::), can be used to automatically generate
conditional variants of instruction patterns.  The 'mnemonic' attribute
can be used to check for the instruction mnemonic (*note Mnemonic
Attribute::).  The compiler internally uses the names 'ce_enabled' and
'nonce_enabled', so they should not be used elsewhere as alternative
names.

 LIST-OF-VALUES is either a string that specifies a comma-separated list
of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string to
indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.

 DEFAULT is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not
include an explicit value for this attribute.  *Note Attr Example::, for
more information on the handling of defaults.  *Note Constant
Attributes::, for information on attributes that do not depend on any
particular insn.

 For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to the
'insn-attr.h' file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
specified for an attribute, the following are defined:

   * A '#define' is written for the symbol 'HAVE_ATTR_NAME'.

   * An enumerated class is defined for 'attr_NAME' with elements of the
     form 'UPPER-NAME_UPPER-VALUE' where the attribute name and value
     are first converted to uppercase.

   * A function 'get_attr_NAME' is defined that is passed an insn and
     returns the attribute value for that insn.

 For example, if the following is present in the 'md' file:

     (define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" ...)

the following lines will be written to the file 'insn-attr.h'.

     #define HAVE_ATTR_type 1
     enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
                      TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
     extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();

 If the attribute takes numeric values, no 'enum' type will be defined
and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return 'int'.

 There are attributes which are tied to a specific meaning.  These
attributes are not free to use for other purposes:

'length'
     The 'length' attribute is used to calculate the length of emitted
     code chunks.  This is especially important when verifying branch
     distances.  *Note Insn Lengths::.

'enabled'
     The 'enabled' attribute can be defined to prevent certain
     alternatives of an insn definition from being used during code
     generation.  *Note Disable Insn Alternatives::.

'mnemonic'
     The 'mnemonic' attribute can be defined to implement instruction
     specific checks in e.g.  the pipeline description.  *Note Mnemonic
     Attribute::.

 For each of these special attributes, the corresponding
'HAVE_ATTR_NAME' '#define' is also written when the attribute is not
defined; in that case, it is defined as '0'.

 Another way of defining an attribute is to use:

     (define_enum_attr "ATTR" "ENUM" DEFAULT)

 This works in just the same way as 'define_attr', except that the list
of values is taken from a separate enumeration called ENUM (*note
define_enum::).  This form allows you to use the same list of values for
several attributes without having to repeat the list each time.  For
example:

     (define_enum "processor" [
       model_a
       model_b
       ...
     ])
     (define_enum_attr "arch" "processor"
       (const (symbol_ref "target_arch")))
     (define_enum_attr "tune" "processor"
       (const (symbol_ref "target_tune")))

 defines the same attributes as:

     (define_attr "arch" "model_a,model_b,..."
       (const (symbol_ref "target_arch")))
     (define_attr "tune" "model_a,model_b,..."
       (const (symbol_ref "target_tune")))

 but without duplicating the processor list.  The second example defines
two separate C enums ('attr_arch' and 'attr_tune') whereas the first
defines a single C enum ('processor').

16.19.2 Attribute Expressions
-----------------------------

RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described above
plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed below.
Attribute value expressions must have one of the following forms:

'(const_int I)'
     The integer I specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  I must
     be non-negative.

     The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
     'const_int', or as an integer represented as a string in
     'const_string', 'eq_attr' (see below), 'attr', 'symbol_ref', simple
     arithmetic expressions, and 'set_attr' overrides on specific
     instructions (*note Tagging Insns::).

'(const_string VALUE)'
     The string VALUE specifies a constant attribute value.  If VALUE is
     specified as '"*"', it means that the default value of the
     attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression.
     '"*"' obviously cannot be used in the DEFAULT expression of a
     'define_attr'.

     If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, VALUE
     must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
     'const_int' would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
     contain one of the valid values for the attribute.

'(if_then_else TEST TRUE-VALUE FALSE-VALUE)'
     TEST specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below.
     The value of this expression is TRUE-VALUE if TEST is true,
     otherwise it is FALSE-VALUE.

'(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 ...] DEFAULT)'
     The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
     number of expressions and consisting of pairs of TEST and VALUE
     expressions.  The value of the 'cond' expression is that of the
     VALUE corresponding to the first true TEST expression.  If none of
     the TEST expressions are true, the value of the 'cond' expression
     is that of the DEFAULT expression.

 TEST expressions can have one of the following forms:

'(const_int I)'
     This test is true if I is nonzero and false otherwise.

'(not TEST)'
'(ior TEST1 TEST2)'
'(and TEST1 TEST2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.

'(match_operand:M N PRED CONSTRAINTS)'
     This test is true if operand N of the insn whose attribute value is
     being determined has mode M (this part of the test is ignored if M
     is 'VOIDmode') and the function specified by the string PRED
     returns a nonzero value when passed operand N and mode M (this part
     of the test is ignored if PRED is the null string).

     The CONSTRAINTS operand is ignored and should be the null string.

'(match_test C-EXPR)'
     The test is true if C expression C-EXPR is true.  In non-constant
     attributes, C-EXPR has access to the following variables:

     INSN
          The rtl instruction under test.
     WHICH_ALTERNATIVE
          The 'define_insn' alternative that INSN matches.  *Note Output
          Statement::.
     OPERANDS
          An array of INSN's rtl operands.

     C-EXPR behaves like the condition in a C 'if' statement, so there
     is no need to explicitly convert the expression into a boolean 0 or
     1 value.  For example, the following two tests are equivalent:

          (match_test "x & 2")
          (match_test "(x & 2) != 0")

'(le ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(leu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(lt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(ltu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(gt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(gtu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(ge ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(geu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(ne ARITH1 ARITH2)'
'(eq ARITH1 ARITH2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated comparison of the two
     arithmetic expressions is true.  Arithmetic expressions are formed
     with 'plus', 'minus', 'mult', 'div', 'mod', 'abs', 'neg', 'and',
     'ior', 'xor', 'not', 'ashift', 'lshiftrt', and 'ashiftrt'
     expressions.

     'const_int' and 'symbol_ref' are always valid terms (*note Insn
     Lengths::,for additional forms).  'symbol_ref' is a string denoting
     a C expression that yields an 'int' when evaluated by the
     'get_attr_...' routine.  It should normally be a global variable.

'(eq_attr NAME VALUE)'
     NAME is a string specifying the name of an attribute.

     VALUE is a string that is either a valid value for attribute NAME,
     a comma-separated list of values, or '!' followed by a value or
     list.  If VALUE does not begin with a '!', this test is true if the
     value of the NAME attribute of the current insn is in the list
     specified by VALUE.  If VALUE begins with a '!', this test is true
     if the attribute's value is _not_ in the specified list.

     For example,

          (eq_attr "type" "load,store")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))

     If NAME specifies an attribute of 'alternative', it refers to the
     value of the compiler variable 'which_alternative' (*note Output
     Statement::) and the values must be small integers.  For example,

          (eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 2))
               (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))

     Note that, for most attributes, an 'eq_attr' test is simplified in
     cases where the value of the attribute being tested is known for
     all insns matching a particular pattern.  This is by far the most
     common case.

'(attr_flag NAME)'
     The value of an 'attr_flag' expression is true if the flag
     specified by NAME is true for the 'insn' currently being scheduled.

     NAME is a string specifying one of a fixed set of flags to test.
     Test the flags 'forward' and 'backward' to determine the direction
     of a conditional branch.

     This example describes a conditional branch delay slot which can be
     nullified for forward branches that are taken (annul-true) or for
     backward branches which are not taken (annul-false).

          (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "cbranch")
            [(eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "forward"))
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "backward"))])

     The 'forward' and 'backward' flags are false if the current 'insn'
     being scheduled is not a conditional branch.

     'attr_flag' is only used during delay slot scheduling and has no
     meaning to other passes of the compiler.

'(attr NAME)'
     The value of another attribute is returned.  This is most useful
     for numeric attributes, as 'eq_attr' and 'attr_flag' produce more
     efficient code for non-numeric attributes.

16.19.3 Assigning Attribute Values to Insns
-------------------------------------------

The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily determined by
which pattern is matched by that insn (or which 'define_peephole'
generated it).  Every 'define_insn' and 'define_peephole' can have an
optional last argument to specify the values of attributes for matching
insns.  The value of any attribute not specified in a particular insn is
set to the default value for that attribute, as specified in its
'define_attr'.  Extensive use of default values for attributes permits
the specification of the values for only one or two attributes in the
definition of most insn patterns, as seen in the example in the next
section.

 The optional last argument of 'define_insn' and 'define_peephole' is a
vector of expressions, each of which defines the value for a single
attribute.  The most general way of assigning an attribute's value is to
use a 'set' expression whose first operand is an 'attr' expression
giving the name of the attribute being set.  The second operand of the
'set' is an attribute expression (*note Expressions::) giving the value
of the attribute.

 When the attribute value depends on the 'alternative' attribute (i.e.,
which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the insn), the
'set_attr_alternative' expression can be used.  It allows the
specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for each
alternative.

 When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not required,
the simpler 'set_attr' expression can be used, which allows specifying a
string giving either a single attribute value or a list of attribute
values, one for each alternative.

 The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In each
case, NAME is a string specifying the attribute to be set.

'(set_attr NAME VALUE-STRING)'
     VALUE-STRING is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
     or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
     succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the
     number of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.

     Note that it may be useful to specify '*' for some alternative, in
     which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns
     matching that alternative.

'(set_attr_alternative NAME [VALUE1 VALUE2 ...])'
     Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of
     the specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a 'cond' with
     tests on the 'alternative' attribute.

'(set (attr NAME) VALUE)'
     The first operand of this 'set' must be the special RTL expression
     'attr', whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
     attribute being set.  VALUE is the value of the attribute.

 The following shows three different ways of representing the same
attribute value specification:

     (set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")

     (set_attr_alternative "type"
                           [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
                            (const_string "arith")])

     (set (attr "type")
          (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
                 (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
                (const_string "arith")))

 The 'define_asm_attributes' expression provides a mechanism to specify
the attributes assigned to insns produced from an 'asm' statement.  It
has the form:

     (define_asm_attributes [ATTR-SETS])

where ATTR-SETS is specified the same as for both the 'define_insn' and
the 'define_peephole' expressions.

 These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.  For
example, they might indicate that the condition code will be clobbered.

 A specification for a 'length' attribute is handled specially.  The way
to compute the length of an 'asm' insn is to multiply the length
specified in the expression 'define_asm_attributes' by the number of
machine instructions specified in the 'asm' statement, determined by
counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the string.
Therefore, the value of the 'length' attribute specified in a
'define_asm_attributes' should be the maximum possible length of a
single machine instruction.

16.19.4 Example of Attribute Specifications
-------------------------------------------

The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into "types" and an
attribute, customarily called 'type', is used to represent this value.
This attribute is normally used only to define the default value for
other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.

 Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
operations, floating point operations, and branches.

 Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an insn
on the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following possible
effects: The condition code can be set unpredictably (clobbered), not be
changed, be set to agree with the results of the operation, or only
changed if the item previously set into the condition code has been
modified.

 Here is part of a sample 'md' file for such a machine:

     (define_attr "type" "load,store,arith,fp,branch" (const_string "arith"))

     (define_attr "cc" "clobber,unchanged,set,change0"
                  (cond [(eq_attr "type" "load")
                             (const_string "change0")
                         (eq_attr "type" "store,branch")
                             (const_string "unchanged")
                         (eq_attr "type" "arith")
                             (if_then_else (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
                                           (const_string "set")
                                           (const_string "clobber"))]
                        (const_string "clobber")))

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,r,m")
             (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r,m,r"))]
       ""
       "@
        move %0,%1
        load %0,%1
        store %0,%1"
       [(set_attr "type" "arith,load,store")])

 Note that we assume in the above example that arithmetic operations
performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the
condition code since they will set the condition code to a value
corresponding to the full-word result.

16.19.5 Computing the Length of an Insn
---------------------------------------

For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are provided,
each for different length branch displacements.  In most cases, the
assembler will choose the correct instruction to use.  However, when the
assembler cannot do so, GCC can when a special attribute, the 'length'
attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be defined to have numeric
values by specifying a null string in its 'define_attr'.

 In the case of the 'length' attribute, two additional forms of
arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:

'(match_dup N)'
     This refers to the address of operand N of the current insn, which
     must be a 'label_ref'.

'(pc)'
     This refers to the address of the _current_ insn.  It might have
     been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of
     the _next_ insn but this would be confusing because the length of
     the current insn is to be computed.

 For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
'length' attribute.  In the case of 'addr_vec' and 'addr_diff_vec' insn
patterns, the length is computed as the number of vectors multiplied by
the size of each vector.

 Lengths are measured in addressable storage units (bytes).

 The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:

'ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (INSN, LENGTH)'
     If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction INSN as a
     function of the context in which it is used.  LENGTH is an lvalue
     that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should
     be updated with the correct length of the insn.

     This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
     required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an 'addr_vec'
     insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that
     alignment may be required.

 The routine that returns 'get_attr_length' (the value of the 'length'
attribute) can be used by the output routine to determine the form of
the branch instruction to be written, as the example below illustrates.

 As an example of the specification of variable-length branches,
consider the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will
be set to the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels
within 4k of the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we
need a six-byte sequence to load the address from memory and then branch
to it.

 On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be
specified as follows:

     (define_insn "jump"
       [(set (pc)
             (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" "")))]
       ""
     {
        return (get_attr_length (insn) == 4
                ? "b %l0" : "l r15,=a(%l0); br r15");
     }
       [(set (attr "length")
             (if_then_else (lt (match_dup 0) (const_int 4096))
                           (const_int 4)
                           (const_int 6)))])


File: gccint.info,  Node: Constant Attributes,  Next: Mnemonic Attribute,  Prev: Insn Lengths,  Up: Insn Attributes

16.19.6 Constant Attributes
---------------------------

A special form of 'define_attr', where the expression for the default
value is a 'const' expression, indicates an attribute that is constant
for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be used to
specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,

     (define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
      (const
       (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
              (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
             (const_string "m88000"))))

     (define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
      (const
       (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
                     (const_string "fast")
                     (const_string "slow"))))

 The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
the value of a constant attribute may use the 'symbol_ref' form, but may
not use either the 'match_operand' form or 'eq_attr' forms involving
insn attributes.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Mnemonic Attribute,  Next: Delay Slots,  Prev: Constant Attributes,  Up: Insn Attributes

16.19.7 Mnemonic Attribute
--------------------------

The 'mnemonic' attribute is a string type attribute holding the
instruction mnemonic for an insn alternative.  The attribute values will
automatically be generated by the machine description parser if there is
an attribute definition in the md file:

     (define_attr "mnemonic" "unknown" (const_string "unknown"))

 The default value can be freely chosen as long as it does not collide
with any of the instruction mnemonics.  This value will be used whenever
the machine description parser is not able to determine the mnemonic
string.  This might be the case for output templates containing more
than a single instruction as in '"mvcle\t%0,%1,0\;jo\t.-4"'.

 The 'mnemonic' attribute set is not generated automatically if the
instruction string is generated via C code.

 An existing 'mnemonic' attribute set in an insn definition will not be
overriden by the md file parser.  That way it is possible to manually
set the instruction mnemonics for the cases where the md file parser
fails to determine it automatically.

 The 'mnemonic' attribute is useful for dealing with instruction
specific properties in the pipeline description without defining
additional insn attributes.

     (define_attr "ooo_expanded" ""
       (cond [(eq_attr "mnemonic" "dlr,dsgr,d,dsgf,stam,dsgfr,dlgr")
              (const_int 1)]
             (const_int 0)))

16.19.8 Delay Slot Scheduling
-----------------------------

The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements for
delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
require a "delay slot" if some instructions that are physically after
the instruction are executed as if they were located before it.  Classic
examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute the
following instruction before the branch or call is performed.

 On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
"annul" instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the instruction
will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both instructions
that annul if the branch is true and instructions that annul if the
branch is false are supported.

 Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
instruction scheduling.

 The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is indicated
via the 'define_delay' expression.  It has the following form:

     (define_delay TEST
                   [DELAY-1 ANNUL-TRUE-1 ANNUL-FALSE-1
                    DELAY-2 ANNUL-TRUE-2 ANNUL-FALSE-2
                    ...])

 TEST is an attribute test that indicates whether this 'define_delay'
applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of required delay slots
is determined by the length of the vector specified as the second
argument.  An insn placed in delay slot N must satisfy attribute test
DELAY-N.  ANNUL-TRUE-N is an attribute test that specifies which insns
may be annulled if the branch is true.  Similarly, ANNUL-FALSE-N
specifies which insns in the delay slot may be annulled if the branch is
false.  If annulling is not supported for that delay slot, '(nil)'
should be coded.

 For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require a
single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
call, the following would be placed in the 'md' file:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

 Multiple 'define_delay' expressions may be specified.  In this case,
each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements and
there must be no insn for which tests in two 'define_delay' expressions
are both true.

 For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for
branches but two for calls, no delay slot can contain a branch or call
insn, and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be
annulled if the branch is true, we might represent this as follows:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
        [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (nil)])

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
                    (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

16.19.9 Specifying processor pipeline description
-------------------------------------------------

To achieve better performance, most modern processors (super-pipelined,
superscalar RISC, and VLIW processors) have many "functional units" on
which several instructions can be executed simultaneously.  An
instruction starts execution if its issue conditions are satisfied.  If
not, the instruction is stalled until its conditions are satisfied.
Such "interlock (pipeline) delay" causes interruption of the fetching of
successor instructions (or demands nop instructions, e.g. for some MIPS
processors).

 There are two major kinds of interlock delays in modern processors.
The first one is a data dependence delay determining "instruction
latency time".  The instruction execution is not started until all
source data have been evaluated by prior instructions (there are more
complex cases when the instruction execution starts even when the data
are not available but will be ready in given time after the instruction
execution start).  Taking the data dependence delays into account is
simple.  The data dependence (true, output, and anti-dependence) delay
between two instructions is given by a constant.  In most cases this
approach is adequate.  The second kind of interlock delays is a
reservation delay.  The reservation delay means that two instructions
under execution will be in need of shared processors resources, i.e.
buses, internal registers, and/or functional units, which are reserved
for some time.  Taking this kind of delay into account is complex
especially for modern RISC processors.

 The task of exploiting more processor parallelism is solved by an
instruction scheduler.  For a better solution to this problem, the
instruction scheduler has to have an adequate description of the
processor parallelism (or "pipeline description").  GCC machine
descriptions describe processor parallelism and functional unit
reservations for groups of instructions with the aid of "regular
expressions".

 The GCC instruction scheduler uses a "pipeline hazard recognizer" to
figure out the possibility of the instruction issue by the processor on
a given simulated processor cycle.  The pipeline hazard recognizer is
automatically generated from the processor pipeline description.  The
pipeline hazard recognizer generated from the machine description is
based on a deterministic finite state automaton (DFA): the instruction
issue is possible if there is a transition from one automaton state to
another one.  This algorithm is very fast, and furthermore, its speed is
not dependent on processor complexity(1).

 The rest of this section describes the directives that constitute an
automaton-based processor pipeline description.  The order of these
constructions within the machine description file is not important.

 The following optional construction describes names of automata
generated and used for the pipeline hazards recognition.  Sometimes the
generated finite state automaton used by the pipeline hazard recognizer
is large.  If we use more than one automaton and bind functional units
to the automata, the total size of the automata is usually less than the
size of the single automaton.  If there is no one such construction,
only one finite state automaton is generated.

     (define_automaton AUTOMATA-NAMES)

 AUTOMATA-NAMES is a string giving names of the automata.  The names are
separated by commas.  All the automata should have unique names.  The
automaton name is used in the constructions 'define_cpu_unit' and
'define_query_cpu_unit'.

 Each processor functional unit used in the description of instruction
reservations should be described by the following construction.

     (define_cpu_unit UNIT-NAMES [AUTOMATON-NAME])

 UNIT-NAMES is a string giving the names of the functional units
separated by commas.  Don't use name 'nothing', it is reserved for other
goals.

 AUTOMATON-NAME is a string giving the name of the automaton with which
the unit is bound.  The automaton should be described in construction
'define_automaton'.  You should give "automaton-name", if there is a
defined automaton.

 The assignment of units to automata are constrained by the uses of the
units in insn reservations.  The most important constraint is: if a unit
reservation is present on a particular cycle of an alternative for an
insn reservation, then some unit from the same automaton must be present
on the same cycle for the other alternatives of the insn reservation.
The rest of the constraints are mentioned in the description of the
subsequent constructions.

 The following construction describes CPU functional units analogously
to 'define_cpu_unit'.  The reservation of such units can be queried for
an automaton state.  The instruction scheduler never queries reservation
of functional units for given automaton state.  So as a rule, you don't
need this construction.  This construction could be used for future code
generation goals (e.g. to generate VLIW insn templates).

     (define_query_cpu_unit UNIT-NAMES [AUTOMATON-NAME])

 UNIT-NAMES is a string giving names of the functional units separated
by commas.

 AUTOMATON-NAME is a string giving the name of the automaton with which
the unit is bound.

 The following construction is the major one to describe pipeline
characteristics of an instruction.

     (define_insn_reservation INSN-NAME DEFAULT_LATENCY
                              CONDITION REGEXP)

 DEFAULT_LATENCY is a number giving latency time of the instruction.
There is an important difference between the old description and the
automaton based pipeline description.  The latency time is used for all
dependencies when we use the old description.  In the automaton based
pipeline description, the given latency time is only used for true
dependencies.  The cost of anti-dependencies is always zero and the cost
of output dependencies is the difference between latency times of the
producing and consuming insns (if the difference is negative, the cost
is considered to be zero).  You can always change the default costs for
any description by using the target hook 'TARGET_SCHED_ADJUST_COST'
(*note Scheduling::).

 INSN-NAME is a string giving the internal name of the insn.  The
internal names are used in constructions 'define_bypass' and in the
automaton description file generated for debugging.  The internal name
has nothing in common with the names in 'define_insn'.  It is a good
practice to use insn classes described in the processor manual.

 CONDITION defines what RTL insns are described by this construction.
You should remember that you will be in trouble if CONDITION for two or
more different 'define_insn_reservation' constructions is TRUE for an
insn.  In this case what reservation will be used for the insn is not
defined.  Such cases are not checked during generation of the pipeline
hazards recognizer because in general recognizing that two conditions
may have the same value is quite difficult (especially if the conditions
contain 'symbol_ref').  It is also not checked during the pipeline
hazard recognizer work because it would slow down the recognizer
considerably.

 REGEXP is a string describing the reservation of the cpu's functional
units by the instruction.  The reservations are described by a regular
expression according to the following syntax:

            regexp = regexp "," oneof
                   | oneof

            oneof = oneof "|" allof
                  | allof

            allof = allof "+" repeat
                  | repeat

            repeat = element "*" number
                   | element

            element = cpu_function_unit_name
                    | reservation_name
                    | result_name
                    | "nothing"
                    | "(" regexp ")"

   * ',' is used for describing the start of the next cycle in the
     reservation.

   * '|' is used for describing a reservation described by the first
     regular expression *or* a reservation described by the second
     regular expression *or* etc.

   * '+' is used for describing a reservation described by the first
     regular expression *and* a reservation described by the second
     regular expression *and* etc.

   * '*' is used for convenience and simply means a sequence in which
     the regular expression are repeated NUMBER times with cycle
     advancing (see ',').

   * 'cpu_function_unit_name' denotes reservation of the named
     functional unit.

   * 'reservation_name' -- see description of construction
     'define_reservation'.

   * 'nothing' denotes no unit reservations.

 Sometimes unit reservations for different insns contain common parts.
In such case, you can simplify the pipeline description by describing
the common part by the following construction

     (define_reservation RESERVATION-NAME REGEXP)

 RESERVATION-NAME is a string giving name of REGEXP.  Functional unit
names and reservation names are in the same name space.  So the
reservation names should be different from the functional unit names and
can not be the reserved name 'nothing'.

 The following construction is used to describe exceptions in the
latency time for given instruction pair.  This is so called bypasses.

     (define_bypass NUMBER OUT_INSN_NAMES IN_INSN_NAMES
                    [GUARD])

 NUMBER defines when the result generated by the instructions given in
string OUT_INSN_NAMES will be ready for the instructions given in string
IN_INSN_NAMES.  Each of these strings is a comma-separated list of
filename-style globs and they refer to the names of
'define_insn_reservation's.  For example:
     (define_bypass 1 "cpu1_load_*, cpu1_store_*" "cpu1_load_*")
 defines a bypass between instructions that start with 'cpu1_load_' or
'cpu1_store_' and those that start with 'cpu1_load_'.

 GUARD is an optional string giving the name of a C function which
defines an additional guard for the bypass.  The function will get the
two insns as parameters.  If the function returns zero the bypass will
be ignored for this case.  The additional guard is necessary to
recognize complicated bypasses, e.g. when the consumer is only an
address of insn 'store' (not a stored value).

 If there are more one bypass with the same output and input insns, the
chosen bypass is the first bypass with a guard in description whose
guard function returns nonzero.  If there is no such bypass, then bypass
without the guard function is chosen.

 The following five constructions are usually used to describe VLIW
processors, or more precisely, to describe a placement of small
instructions into VLIW instruction slots.  They can be used for RISC
processors, too.

     (exclusion_set UNIT-NAMES UNIT-NAMES)
     (presence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)
     (final_presence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)
     (absence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)
     (final_absence_set UNIT-NAMES PATTERNS)

 UNIT-NAMES is a string giving names of functional units separated by
commas.

 PATTERNS is a string giving patterns of functional units separated by
comma.  Currently pattern is one unit or units separated by
white-spaces.

 The first construction ('exclusion_set') means that each functional
unit in the first string can not be reserved simultaneously with a unit
whose name is in the second string and vice versa.  For example, the
construction is useful for describing processors (e.g. some SPARC
processors) with a fully pipelined floating point functional unit which
can execute simultaneously only single floating point insns or only
double floating point insns.

 The second construction ('presence_set') means that each functional
unit in the first string can not be reserved unless at least one of
pattern of units whose names are in the second string is reserved.  This
is an asymmetric relation.  For example, it is useful for description
that VLIW 'slot1' is reserved after 'slot0' reservation.  We could
describe it by the following construction

     (presence_set "slot1" "slot0")

 Or 'slot1' is reserved only after 'slot0' and unit 'b0' reservation.
In this case we could write

     (presence_set "slot1" "slot0 b0")

 The third construction ('final_presence_set') is analogous to
'presence_set'.  The difference between them is when checking is done.
When an instruction is issued in given automaton state reflecting all
current and planned unit reservations, the automaton state is changed.
The first state is a source state, the second one is a result state.
Checking for 'presence_set' is done on the source state reservation,
checking for 'final_presence_set' is done on the result reservation.
This construction is useful to describe a reservation which is actually
two subsequent reservations.  For example, if we use

     (presence_set "slot1" "slot0")

 the following insn will be never issued (because 'slot1' requires
'slot0' which is absent in the source state).

     (define_reservation "insn_and_nop" "slot0 + slot1")

 but it can be issued if we use analogous 'final_presence_set'.

 The forth construction ('absence_set') means that each functional unit
in the first string can be reserved only if each pattern of units whose
names are in the second string is not reserved.  This is an asymmetric
relation (actually 'exclusion_set' is analogous to this one but it is
symmetric).  For example it might be useful in a VLIW description to say
that 'slot0' cannot be reserved after either 'slot1' or 'slot2' have
been reserved.  This can be described as:

     (absence_set "slot0" "slot1, slot2")

 Or 'slot2' can not be reserved if 'slot0' and unit 'b0' are reserved or
'slot1' and unit 'b1' are reserved.  In this case we could write

     (absence_set "slot2" "slot0 b0, slot1 b1")

 All functional units mentioned in a set should belong to the same
automaton.

 The last construction ('final_absence_set') is analogous to
'absence_set' but checking is done on the result (state) reservation.
See comments for 'final_presence_set'.

 You can control the generator of the pipeline hazard recognizer with
the following construction.

     (automata_option OPTIONS)

 OPTIONS is a string giving options which affect the generated code.
Currently there are the following options:

   * "no-minimization" makes no minimization of the automaton.  This is
     only worth to do when we are debugging the description and need to
     look more accurately at reservations of states.

   * "time" means printing time statistics about the generation of
     automata.

   * "stats" means printing statistics about the generated automata such
     as the number of DFA states, NDFA states and arcs.

   * "v" means a generation of the file describing the result automata.
     The file has suffix '.dfa' and can be used for the description
     verification and debugging.

   * "w" means a generation of warning instead of error for non-critical
     errors.

   * "no-comb-vect" prevents the automaton generator from generating two
     data structures and comparing them for space efficiency.  Using a
     comb vector to represent transitions may be better, but it can be
     very expensive to construct.  This option is useful if the build
     process spends an unacceptably long time in genautomata.

   * "ndfa" makes nondeterministic finite state automata.  This affects
     the treatment of operator '|' in the regular expressions.  The
     usual treatment of the operator is to try the first alternative
     and, if the reservation is not possible, the second alternative.
     The nondeterministic treatment means trying all alternatives, some
     of them may be rejected by reservations in the subsequent insns.

   * "collapse-ndfa" modifies the behaviour of the generator when
     producing an automaton.  An additional state transition to collapse
     a nondeterministic NDFA state to a deterministic DFA state is
     generated.  It can be triggered by passing 'const0_rtx' to
     state_transition.  In such an automaton, cycle advance transitions
     are available only for these collapsed states.  This option is
     useful for ports that want to use the 'ndfa' option, but also want
     to use 'define_query_cpu_unit' to assign units to insns issued in a
     cycle.

   * "progress" means output of a progress bar showing how many states
     were generated so far for automaton being processed.  This is
     useful during debugging a DFA description.  If you see too many
     generated states, you could interrupt the generator of the pipeline
     hazard recognizer and try to figure out a reason for generation of
     the huge automaton.

 As an example, consider a superscalar RISC machine which can issue
three insns (two integer insns and one floating point insn) on the cycle
but can finish only two insns.  To describe this, we define the
following functional units.

     (define_cpu_unit "i0_pipeline, i1_pipeline, f_pipeline")
     (define_cpu_unit "port0, port1")

 All simple integer insns can be executed in any integer pipeline and
their result is ready in two cycles.  The simple integer insns are
issued into the first pipeline unless it is reserved, otherwise they are
issued into the second pipeline.  Integer division and multiplication
insns can be executed only in the second integer pipeline and their
results are ready correspondingly in 8 and 4 cycles.  The integer
division is not pipelined, i.e. the subsequent integer division insn can
not be issued until the current division insn finished.  Floating point
insns are fully pipelined and their results are ready in 3 cycles.
Where the result of a floating point insn is used by an integer insn, an
additional delay of one cycle is incurred.  To describe all of this we
could specify

     (define_cpu_unit "div")

     (define_insn_reservation "simple" 2 (eq_attr "type" "int")
                              "(i0_pipeline | i1_pipeline), (port0 | port1)")

     (define_insn_reservation "mult" 4 (eq_attr "type" "mult")
                              "i1_pipeline, nothing*2, (port0 | port1)")

     (define_insn_reservation "div" 8 (eq_attr "type" "div")
                              "i1_pipeline, div*7, div + (port0 | port1)")

     (define_insn_reservation "float" 3 (eq_attr "type" "float")
                              "f_pipeline, nothing, (port0 | port1))

     (define_bypass 4 "float" "simple,mult,div")

 To simplify the description we could describe the following reservation

     (define_reservation "finish" "port0|port1")

 and use it in all 'define_insn_reservation' as in the following
construction

     (define_insn_reservation "simple" 2 (eq_attr "type" "int")
                              "(i0_pipeline | i1_pipeline), finish")

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) However, the size of the automaton depends on processor
complexity.  To limit this effect, machine descriptions can split
orthogonal parts of the machine description among several automata: but
then, since each of these must be stepped independently, this does cause
a small decrease in the algorithm's performance.

16.20 Conditional Execution
===========================

A number of architectures provide for some form of conditional
execution, or predication.  The hallmark of this feature is the ability
to nullify most of the instructions in the instruction set.  When the
instruction set is large and not entirely symmetric, it can be quite
tedious to describe these forms directly in the '.md' file.  An
alternative is the 'define_cond_exec' template.

     (define_cond_exec
       [PREDICATE-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       "OUTPUT-TEMPLATE"
       "OPTIONAL-INSN-ATTRIBUES")

 PREDICATE-PATTERN is the condition that must be true for the insn to be
executed at runtime and should match a relational operator.  One can use
'match_operator' to match several relational operators at once.  Any
'match_operand' operands must have no more than one alternative.

 CONDITION is a C expression that must be true for the generated pattern
to match.

 OUTPUT-TEMPLATE is a string similar to the 'define_insn' output
template (*note Output Template::), except that the '*' and '@' special
cases do not apply.  This is only useful if the assembly text for the
predicate is a simple prefix to the main insn.  In order to handle the
general case, there is a global variable 'current_insn_predicate' that
will contain the entire predicate if the current insn is predicated, and
will otherwise be 'NULL'.

 OPTIONAL-INSN-ATTRIBUTES is an optional vector of attributes that gets
appended to the insn attributes of the produced cond_exec rtx.  It can
be used to add some distinguishing attribute to cond_exec rtxs produced
that way.  An example usage would be to use this attribute in
conjunction with attributes on the main pattern to disable particular
alternatives under certain conditions.

 When 'define_cond_exec' is used, an implicit reference to the
'predicable' instruction attribute is made.  *Note Insn Attributes::.
This attribute must be a boolean (i.e. have exactly two elements in its
LIST-OF-VALUES), with the possible values being 'no' and 'yes'.  The
default and all uses in the insns must be a simple constant, not a
complex expressions.  It may, however, depend on the alternative, by
using a comma-separated list of values.  If that is the case, the port
should also define an 'enabled' attribute (*note Disable Insn
Alternatives::), which should also allow only 'no' and 'yes' as its
values.

 For each 'define_insn' for which the 'predicable' attribute is true, a
new 'define_insn' pattern will be generated that matches a predicated
version of the instruction.  For example,

     (define_insn "addsi"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "r")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r")))]
       "TEST1"
       "add %2,%1,%0")

     (define_cond_exec
       [(ne (match_operand:CC 0 "register_operand" "c")
            (const_int 0))]
       "TEST2"
       "(%0)")

generates a new pattern

     (define_insn ""
       [(cond_exec
          (ne (match_operand:CC 3 "register_operand" "c") (const_int 0))
          (set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "r")
               (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
                        (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r"))))]
       "(TEST2) && (TEST1)"
       "(%3) add %2,%1,%0")

16.21 RTL Templates Transformations
===================================

For some hardware architectures there are common cases when the RTL
templates for the instructions can be derived from the other RTL
templates using simple transformations.  E.g., 'i386.md' contains an RTL
template for the ordinary 'sub' instruction-- '*subsi_1', and for the
'sub' instruction with subsequent zero-extension--'*subsi_1_zext'.  Such
cases can be easily implemented by a single meta-template capable of
generating a modified case based on the initial one:

     (define_subst "NAME"
       [INPUT-TEMPLATE]
       "CONDITION"
       [OUTPUT-TEMPLATE])
 INPUT-TEMPLATE is a pattern describing the source RTL template, which
will be transformed.

 CONDITION is a C expression that is conjunct with the condition from
the input-template to generate a condition to be used in the
output-template.

 OUTPUT-TEMPLATE is a pattern that will be used in the resulting
template.

 'define_subst' mechanism is tightly coupled with the notion of the
subst attribute (*note Subst Iterators::).  The use of 'define_subst' is
triggered by a reference to a subst attribute in the transforming RTL
template.  This reference initiates duplication of the source RTL
template and substitution of the attributes with their values.  The
source RTL template is left unchanged, while the copy is transformed by
'define_subst'.  This transformation can fail in the case when the
source RTL template is not matched against the input-template of the
'define_subst'.  In such case the copy is deleted.

 'define_subst' can be used only in 'define_insn' and 'define_expand',
it cannot be used in other expressions (e.g.  in
'define_insn_and_split').

16.21.1 'define_subst' Example
------------------------------

To illustrate how 'define_subst' works, let us examine a simple template
transformation.

 Suppose there are two kinds of instructions: one that touches flags and
the other that does not.  The instructions of the second type could be
generated with the following 'define_subst':

     (define_subst "add_clobber_subst"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
             (match_operand:SI 1 "" ""))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0)
             (match_dup 1))
        (clobber (reg:CC FLAGS_REG))]

 This 'define_subst' can be applied to any RTL pattern containing 'set'
of mode SI and generates a copy with clobber when it is applied.

 Assume there is an RTL template for a 'max' instruction to be used in
'define_subst' mentioned above:

     (define_insn "maxsi"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
             (max:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "max\t{%2, %1, %0|%0, %1, %2}"
      [...])

 To mark the RTL template for 'define_subst' application,
subst-attributes are used.  They should be declared in advance:

     (define_subst_attr "add_clobber_name" "add_clobber_subst" "_noclobber" "_clobber")

 Here 'add_clobber_name' is the attribute name, 'add_clobber_subst' is
the name of the corresponding 'define_subst', the third argument
('_noclobber') is the attribute value that would be substituted into the
unchanged version of the source RTL template, and the last argument
('_clobber') is the value that would be substituted into the second,
transformed, version of the RTL template.

 Once the subst-attribute has been defined, it should be used in RTL
templates which need to be processed by the 'define_subst'.  So, the
original RTL template should be changed:

     (define_insn "maxsi<add_clobber_name>"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
             (max:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "max\t{%2, %1, %0|%0, %1, %2}"
      [...])

 The result of the 'define_subst' usage would look like the following:

     (define_insn "maxsi_noclobber"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
             (max:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "max\t{%2, %1, %0|%0, %1, %2}"
      [...])
     (define_insn "maxsi_clobber"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r")
             (max:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "r")))
        (clobber (reg:CC FLAGS_REG))]
       ""
       "max\t{%2, %1, %0|%0, %1, %2}"
      [...])

16.21.2 Pattern Matching in 'define_subst'
------------------------------------------

All expressions, allowed in 'define_insn' or 'define_expand', are
allowed in the input-template of 'define_subst', except 'match_par_dup',
'match_scratch', 'match_parallel'.  The meanings of expressions in the
input-template were changed:

 'match_operand' matches any expression (possibly, a subtree in
RTL-template), if modes of the 'match_operand' and this expression are
the same, or mode of the 'match_operand' is 'VOIDmode', or this
expression is 'match_dup', 'match_op_dup'.  If the expression is
'match_operand' too, and predicate of 'match_operand' from the input
pattern is not empty, then the predicates are compared.  That can be
used for more accurate filtering of accepted RTL-templates.

 'match_operator' matches common operators (like 'plus', 'minus'),
'unspec', 'unspec_volatile' operators and 'match_operator's from the
original pattern if the modes match and 'match_operator' from the input
pattern has the same number of operands as the operator from the
original pattern.

16.21.3 Generation of output template in 'define_subst'
-------------------------------------------------------

If all necessary checks for 'define_subst' application pass, a new
RTL-pattern, based on the output-template, is created to replace the old
template.  Like in input-patterns, meanings of some RTL expressions are
changed when they are used in output-patterns of a 'define_subst'.
Thus, 'match_dup' is used for copying the whole expression from the
original pattern, which matched corresponding 'match_operand' from the
input pattern.

 'match_dup N' is used in the output template to be replaced with the
expression from the original pattern, which matched 'match_operand N'
from the input pattern.  As a consequence, 'match_dup' cannot be used to
point to 'match_operand's from the output pattern, it should always
refer to a 'match_operand' from the input pattern.

 In the output template one can refer to the expressions from the
original pattern and create new ones.  For instance, some operands could
be added by means of standard 'match_operand'.

 After replacing 'match_dup' with some RTL-subtree from the original
pattern, it could happen that several 'match_operand's in the output
pattern have the same indexes.  It is unknown, how many and what indexes
would be used in the expression which would replace 'match_dup', so such
conflicts in indexes are inevitable.  To overcome this issue,
'match_operands' and 'match_operators', which were introduced into the
output pattern, are renumerated when all 'match_dup's are replaced.

 Number of alternatives in 'match_operand's introduced into the output
template 'M' could differ from the number of alternatives in the
original pattern 'N', so in the resultant pattern there would be 'N*M'
alternatives.  Thus, constraints from the original pattern would be
duplicated 'N' times, constraints from the output pattern would be
duplicated 'M' times, producing all possible combinations.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Constant Definitions,  Next: Iterators,  Prev: Define Subst,  Up: Machine Desc

16.22 Constant Definitions
==========================

Using literal constants inside instruction patterns reduces legibility
and can be a maintenance problem.

 To overcome this problem, you may use the 'define_constants'
expression.  It contains a vector of name-value pairs.  From that point
on, wherever any of the names appears in the MD file, it is as if the
corresponding value had been written instead.  You may use
'define_constants' multiple times; each appearance adds more constants
to the table.  It is an error to redefine a constant with a different
value.

 To come back to the a29k load multiple example, instead of

     (define_insn ""
       [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
          [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
           (use (reg:SI 179))
           (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
       ""
       "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

 You could write:

     (define_constants [
         (R_BP 177)
         (R_FC 178)
         (R_CR 179)
         (R_Q  180)
     ])

     (define_insn ""
       [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
          [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
           (use (reg:SI R_CR))
           (clobber (reg:SI R_CR))])]
       ""
       "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

 The constants that are defined with a define_constant are also output
in the insn-codes.h header file as #defines.

 You can also use the machine description file to define enumerations.
Like the constants defined by 'define_constant', these enumerations are
visible to both the machine description file and the main C code.

 The syntax is as follows:

     (define_c_enum "NAME" [
       VALUE0
       VALUE1
       ...
       VALUEN
     ])

 This definition causes the equivalent of the following C code to appear
in 'insn-constants.h':

     enum NAME {
       VALUE0 = 0,
       VALUE1 = 1,
       ...
       VALUEN = N
     };
     #define NUM_CNAME_VALUES (N + 1)

 where CNAME is the capitalized form of NAME.  It also makes each VALUEI
available in the machine description file, just as if it had been
declared with:

     (define_constants [(VALUEI I)])

 Each VALUEI is usually an upper-case identifier and usually begins with
CNAME.

 You can split the enumeration definition into as many statements as you
like.  The above example is directly equivalent to:

     (define_c_enum "NAME" [VALUE0])
     (define_c_enum "NAME" [VALUE1])
     ...
     (define_c_enum "NAME" [VALUEN])

 Splitting the enumeration helps to improve the modularity of each
individual '.md' file.  For example, if a port defines its
synchronization instructions in a separate 'sync.md' file, it is
convenient to define all synchronization-specific enumeration values in
'sync.md' rather than in the main '.md' file.

 Some enumeration names have special significance to GCC:

'unspecv'
     If an enumeration called 'unspecv' is defined, GCC will use it when
     printing out 'unspec_volatile' expressions.  For example:

          (define_c_enum "unspecv" [
            UNSPECV_BLOCKAGE
          ])

     causes GCC to print '(unspec_volatile ... 0)' as:

          (unspec_volatile ... UNSPECV_BLOCKAGE)

'unspec'
     If an enumeration called 'unspec' is defined, GCC will use it when
     printing out 'unspec' expressions.  GCC will also use it when
     printing out 'unspec_volatile' expressions unless an 'unspecv'
     enumeration is also defined.  You can therefore decide whether to
     keep separate enumerations for volatile and non-volatile
     expressions or whether to use the same enumeration for both.

 Another way of defining an enumeration is to use 'define_enum':

     (define_enum "NAME" [
       VALUE0
       VALUE1
       ...
       VALUEN
     ])

 This directive implies:

     (define_c_enum "NAME" [
       CNAME_CVALUE0
       CNAME_CVALUE1
       ...
       CNAME_CVALUEN
     ])

 where CVALUEI is the capitalized form of VALUEI.  However, unlike
'define_c_enum', the enumerations defined by 'define_enum' can be used
in attribute specifications (*note define_enum_attr::).

16.23 Iterators
===============

Ports often need to define similar patterns for more than one machine
mode or for more than one rtx code.  GCC provides some simple iterator
facilities to make this process easier.

* Code Iterators::         Doing the same for codes.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Mode Iterators,  Next: Code Iterators,  Up: Iterators

16.23.1 Mode Iterators
----------------------

Ports often need to define similar patterns for two or more different
modes.  For example:

   * If a processor has hardware support for both single and double
     floating-point arithmetic, the 'SFmode' patterns tend to be very
     similar to the 'DFmode' ones.

   * If a port uses 'SImode' pointers in one configuration and 'DImode'
     pointers in another, it will usually have very similar 'SImode' and
     'DImode' patterns for manipulating pointers.

 Mode iterators allow several patterns to be instantiated from one '.md'
file template.  They can be used with any type of rtx-based construct,
such as a 'define_insn', 'define_split', or 'define_peephole2'.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Defining Mode Iterators,  Next: Substitutions,  Up: Mode Iterators

16.23.1.1 Defining Mode Iterators
.................................

The syntax for defining a mode iterator is:

     (define_mode_iterator NAME [(MODE1 "COND1") ... (MODEN "CONDN")])

 This allows subsequent '.md' file constructs to use the mode suffix
':NAME'.  Every construct that does so will be expanded N times, once
with every use of ':NAME' replaced by ':MODE1', once with every use
replaced by ':MODE2', and so on.  In the expansion for a particular
MODEI, every C condition will also require that CONDI be true.

 For example:

     (define_mode_iterator P [(SI "Pmode == SImode") (DI "Pmode == DImode")])

 defines a new mode suffix ':P'.  Every construct that uses ':P' will be
expanded twice, once with every ':P' replaced by ':SI' and once with
every ':P' replaced by ':DI'.  The ':SI' version will only apply if
'Pmode == SImode' and the ':DI' version will only apply if 'Pmode ==
DImode'.

 As with other '.md' conditions, an empty string is treated as "always
true".  '(MODE "")' can also be abbreviated to 'MODE'.  For example:

     (define_mode_iterator GPR [SI (DI "TARGET_64BIT")])

 means that the ':DI' expansion only applies if 'TARGET_64BIT' but that
the ':SI' expansion has no such constraint.

 Iterators are applied in the order they are defined.  This can be
significant if two iterators are used in a construct that requires
substitutions.  *Note Substitutions::.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Substitutions,  Next: Examples,  Prev: Defining Mode Iterators,  Up: Mode Iterators

16.23.1.2 Substitution in Mode Iterators
........................................

If an '.md' file construct uses mode iterators, each version of the
construct will often need slightly different strings or modes.  For
example:

   * When a 'define_expand' defines several 'addM3' patterns (*note
     Standard Names::), each expander will need to use the appropriate
     mode name for M.

   * When a 'define_insn' defines several instruction patterns, each
     instruction will often use a different assembler mnemonic.

   * When a 'define_insn' requires operands with different modes, using
     an iterator for one of the operand modes usually requires a
     specific mode for the other operand(s).

 GCC supports such variations through a system of "mode attributes".
There are two standard attributes: 'mode', which is the name of the mode
in lower case, and 'MODE', which is the same thing in upper case.  You
can define other attributes using:

     (define_mode_attr NAME [(MODE1 "VALUE1") ... (MODEN "VALUEN")])

 where NAME is the name of the attribute and VALUEI is the value
associated with MODEI.

 When GCC replaces some :ITERATOR with :MODE, it will scan each string
and mode in the pattern for sequences of the form '<ITERATOR:ATTR>',
where ATTR is the name of a mode attribute.  If the attribute is defined
for MODE, the whole '<...>' sequence will be replaced by the appropriate
attribute value.

 For example, suppose an '.md' file has:

     (define_mode_iterator P [(SI "Pmode == SImode") (DI "Pmode == DImode")])
     (define_mode_attr load [(SI "lw") (DI "ld")])

 If one of the patterns that uses ':P' contains the string
'"<P:load>\t%0,%1"', the 'SI' version of that pattern will use
'"lw\t%0,%1"' and the 'DI' version will use '"ld\t%0,%1"'.

 Here is an example of using an attribute for a mode:

     (define_mode_iterator LONG [SI DI])
     (define_mode_attr SHORT [(SI "HI") (DI "SI")])
     (define_insn ...
       (sign_extend:LONG (match_operand:<LONG:SHORT> ...)) ...)

 The 'ITERATOR:' prefix may be omitted, in which case the substitution
will be attempted for every iterator expansion.

16.23.1.3 Mode Iterator Examples
................................

Here is an example from the MIPS port.  It defines the following modes
and attributes (among others):

     (define_mode_iterator GPR [SI (DI "TARGET_64BIT")])
     (define_mode_attr d [(SI "") (DI "d")])

 and uses the following template to define both 'subsi3' and 'subdi3':

     (define_insn "sub<mode>3"
       [(set (match_operand:GPR 0 "register_operand" "=d")
             (minus:GPR (match_operand:GPR 1 "register_operand" "d")
                        (match_operand:GPR 2 "register_operand" "d")))]
       ""
       "<d>subu\t%0,%1,%2"
       [(set_attr "type" "arith")
        (set_attr "mode" "<MODE>")])

 This is exactly equivalent to:

     (define_insn "subsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=d")
             (minus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "d")
                       (match_operand:SI 2 "register_operand" "d")))]
       ""
       "subu\t%0,%1,%2"
       [(set_attr "type" "arith")
        (set_attr "mode" "SI")])

     (define_insn "subdi3"
       [(set (match_operand:DI 0 "register_operand" "=d")
             (minus:DI (match_operand:DI 1 "register_operand" "d")
                       (match_operand:DI 2 "register_operand" "d")))]
       ""
       "dsubu\t%0,%1,%2"

16.23.2 Code Iterators
----------------------

Code iterators operate in a similar way to mode iterators.  *Note Mode
Iterators::.

 The construct:

     (define_code_iterator NAME [(CODE1 "COND1") ... (CODEN "CONDN")])

 defines a pseudo rtx code NAME that can be instantiated as CODEI if
condition CONDI is true.  Each CODEI must have the same rtx format.
*Note RTL Classes::.

 As with mode iterators, each pattern that uses NAME will be expanded N
times, once with all uses of NAME replaced by CODE1, once with all uses
replaced by CODE2, and so on.  *Note Defining Mode Iterators::.

 It is possible to define attributes for codes as well as for modes.
There are two standard code attributes: 'code', the name of the code in
lower case, and 'CODE', the name of the code in upper case.  Other
attributes are defined using:

     (define_code_attr NAME [(CODE1 "VALUE1") ... (CODEN "VALUEN")])

 Here's an example of code iterators in action, taken from the MIPS
port:

     (define_code_iterator any_cond [unordered ordered unlt unge uneq ltgt unle ungt
                                     eq ne gt ge lt le gtu geu ltu leu])

     (define_expand "b<code>"
       [(set (pc)
             (if_then_else (any_cond:CC (cc0)
                                        (const_int 0))
                           (label_ref (match_operand 0 ""))
                           (pc)))]
       ""
     {
       gen_conditional_branch (operands, <CODE>);
       DONE;
     })

 This is equivalent to:

     (define_expand "bunordered"
       [(set (pc)
             (if_then_else (unordered:CC (cc0)
                                         (const_int 0))
                           (label_ref (match_operand 0 ""))

16.23.3 Int Iterators
---------------------

Int iterators operate in a similar way to code iterators.  *Note Code
Iterators::.

 The construct:

     (define_int_iterator NAME [(INT1 "COND1") ... (INTN "CONDN")])

 defines a pseudo integer constant NAME that can be instantiated as INTI
if condition CONDI is true.  Each INT must have the same rtx format.
*Note RTL Classes::.  Int iterators can appear in only those rtx fields
that have 'i' as the specifier.  This means that each INT has to be a
constant defined using define_constant or define_c_enum.

 As with mode and code iterators, each pattern that uses NAME will be
expanded N times, once with all uses of NAME replaced by INT1, once with
all uses replaced by INT2, and so on.  *Note Defining Mode Iterators::.

 It is possible to define attributes for ints as well as for codes and
modes.  Attributes are defined using:

     (define_int_attr NAME [(INT1 "VALUE1") ... (INTN "VALUEN")])

 Here's an example of int iterators in action, taken from the ARM port:

     (define_int_iterator QABSNEG [UNSPEC_VQABS UNSPEC_VQNEG])

     (define_int_attr absneg [(UNSPEC_VQABS "abs") (UNSPEC_VQNEG "neg")])

     (define_insn "neon_vq<absneg><mode>"
       [(set (match_operand:VDQIW 0 "s_register_operand" "=w")
     	(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 "s_register_operand" "w")
     		       (match_operand:SI 2 "immediate_operand" "i")]
     		      QABSNEG))]
       "TARGET_NEON"
       "vq<absneg>.<V_s_elem>\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1"
       [(set_attr "type" "neon_vqneg_vqabs")]
     )


 This is equivalent to:

     (define_insn "neon_vqabs<mode>"
       [(set (match_operand:VDQIW 0 "s_register_operand" "=w")
     	(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 "s_register_operand" "w")
     		       (match_operand:SI 2 "immediate_operand" "i")]
     		      UNSPEC_VQABS))]
       "TARGET_NEON"
       "vqabs.<V_s_elem>\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1"

     		       (match_operand:SI 2 "immediate_operand" "i")]
     		      UNSPEC_VQNEG))]
       "TARGET_NEON"
       "vqneg.<V_s_elem>\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1"
       [(set_attr "type" "neon_vqneg_vqabs")]
     )

16.23.4 Subst Iterators
-----------------------

Subst iterators are special type of iterators with the following
restrictions: they could not be declared explicitly, they always have
only two values, and they do not have explicit dedicated name.
Subst-iterators are triggered only when corresponding subst-attribute is
used in RTL-pattern.

 Subst iterators transform templates in the following way: the templates
are duplicated, the subst-attributes in these templates are replaced
with the corresponding values, and a new attribute is implicitly added
to the given 'define_insn'/'define_expand'.  The name of the added
attribute matches the name of 'define_subst'.  Such attributes are
declared implicitly, and it is not allowed to have a 'define_attr' named
as a 'define_subst'.

 Each subst iterator is linked to a 'define_subst'.  It is declared
implicitly by the first appearance of the corresponding
'define_subst_attr', and it is not allowed to define it explicitly.

 Declarations of subst-attributes have the following syntax:

     (define_subst_attr "NAME"
       "SUBST-NAME"
       "NO-SUBST-VALUE"
       "SUBST-APPLIED-VALUE")

 NAME is a string with which the given subst-attribute could be referred
to.

 SUBST-NAME shows which 'define_subst' should be applied to an
RTL-template if the given subst-attribute is present in the
RTL-template.

 NO-SUBST-VALUE is a value with which subst-attribute would be replaced
in the first copy of the original RTL-template.

 SUBST-APPLIED-VALUE is a value with which subst-attribute would be
replaced in the second copy of the original RTL-template.

17 Target Description Macros and Functions
******************************************

In addition to the file 'MACHINE.md', a machine description includes a C
header file conventionally given the name 'MACHINE.h' and a C source
file named 'MACHINE.c'.  The header file defines numerous macros that
convey the information about the target machine that does not fit into
the scheme of the '.md' file.  The file 'tm.h' should be a link to
'MACHINE.h'.  The header file 'config.h' includes 'tm.h' and most
compiler source files include 'config.h'.  The source file defines a
variable 'targetm', which is a structure containing pointers to
functions and data relating to the target machine.  'MACHINE.c' should
also contain their definitions, if they are not defined elsewhere in
GCC, and other functions called through the macros defined in the '.h'
file.

17.1 The Global 'targetm' Variable
==================================

 -- Variable: struct gcc_target targetm
     The target '.c' file must define the global 'targetm' variable
     which contains pointers to functions and data relating to the
     target machine.  The variable is declared in 'target.h';
     'target-def.h' defines the macro 'TARGET_INITIALIZER' which is used
     to initialize the variable, and macros for the default initializers
     for elements of the structure.  The '.c' file should override those
     macros for which the default definition is inappropriate.  For
     example:
          #include "target.h"
          #include "target-def.h"

          /* Initialize the GCC target structure.  */

          #undef TARGET_COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES
          #define TARGET_COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES MACHINE_comp_type_attributes

          struct gcc_target targetm = TARGET_INITIALIZER;

 Where a macro should be defined in the '.c' file in this manner to form
part of the 'targetm' structure, it is documented below as a "Target
Hook" with a prototype.  Many macros will change in future from being
defined in the '.h' file to being part of the 'targetm' structure.

 Similarly, there is a 'targetcm' variable for hooks that are specific
to front ends for C-family languages, documented as "C Target Hook".
This is declared in 'c-family/c-target.h', the initializer
'TARGETCM_INITIALIZER' in 'c-family/c-target-def.h'.  If targets
initialize 'targetcm' themselves, they should set
'target_has_targetcm=yes' in 'config.gcc'; otherwise a default
definition is used.

 Similarly, there is a 'targetm_common' variable for hooks that are
shared between the compiler driver and the compilers proper, documented
as "Common Target Hook".  This is declared in 'common/common-target.h',
the initializer 'TARGETM_COMMON_INITIALIZER' in
'common/common-target-def.h'.  If targets initialize 'targetm_common'
themselves, they should set 'target_has_targetm_common=yes' in
'config.gcc'; otherwise a default definition is used.

17.2 Controlling the Compilation Driver, 'gcc'
==============================================

You can control the compilation driver.

 -- Macro: DRIVER_SELF_SPECS
     A list of specs for the driver itself.  It should be a suitable
     initializer for an array of strings, with no surrounding braces.

     The driver applies these specs to its own command line between
     loading default 'specs' files (but not command-line specified ones)
     and choosing the multilib directory or running any subcommands.  It
     applies them in the order given, so each spec can depend on the
     options added by earlier ones.  It is also possible to remove
     options using '%<OPTION' in the usual way.

     This macro can be useful when a port has several interdependent
     target options.  It provides a way of standardizing the command
     line so that the other specs are easier to write.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: OPTION_DEFAULT_SPECS
     A list of specs used to support configure-time default options
     (i.e. '--with' options) in the driver.  It should be a suitable
     initializer for an array of structures, each containing two
     strings, without the outermost pair of surrounding braces.

     The first item in the pair is the name of the default.  This must
     match the code in 'config.gcc' for the target.  The second item is
     a spec to apply if a default with this name was specified.  The
     string '%(VALUE)' in the spec will be replaced by the value of the
     default everywhere it occurs.

     The driver will apply these specs to its own command line between
     loading default 'specs' files and processing 'DRIVER_SELF_SPECS',
     using the same mechanism as 'DRIVER_SELF_SPECS'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: CPP_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you give
     to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the CPP.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: CPLUSPLUS_CPP_SPEC
     This macro is just like 'CPP_SPEC', but is used for C++, rather
     than C.  If you do not define this macro, then the value of
     'CPP_SPEC' (if any) will be used instead.

 -- Macro: CC1_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to 'cc1', 'cc1plus', 'f771', and the other language front
     ends.  It can also specify how to translate options you give to GCC
     into options for GCC to pass to front ends.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: CC1PLUS_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to 'cc1plus'.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the 'cc1plus'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.  Note
     that everything defined in CC1_SPEC is already passed to 'cc1plus'
     so there is no need to duplicate the contents of CC1_SPEC in
     CC1PLUS_SPEC.

 -- Macro: ASM_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate
     options you give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the
     assembler.  See the file 'sun3.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: ASM_FINAL_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program how to run
     any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler.  Normally,
     this is not needed.  See the file 'mips.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: AS_NEEDS_DASH_FOR_PIPED_INPUT
     Define this macro, with no value, if the driver should give the
     assembler an argument consisting of a single dash, '-', to instruct
     it to read from its standard input (which will be a pipe connected
     to the output of the compiler proper).  This argument is given
     after any '-o' option specifying the name of the output file.

     If you do not define this macro, the assembler is assumed to read
     its standard input if given no non-option arguments.  If your
     assembler cannot read standard input at all, use a '%{pipe:%e}'
     construct; see 'mips.h' for instance.

 -- Macro: LINK_SPEC
     A C string constant that tells the GCC driver program options to
     pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GCC into options for GCC to pass to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: LIB_SPEC
     Another C string constant used much like 'LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that 'LIB_SPEC' is used at the end of
     the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C library from the usual place.  See 'gcc.c'.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC_SPEC
     Another C string constant that tells the GCC driver program how and
     when to place a reference to 'libgcc.a' into the linker command
     line.  This constant is placed both before and after the value of
     'LIB_SPEC'.

     If this macro is not defined, the GCC driver provides a default
     that passes the string '-lgcc' to the linker.

 -- Macro: REAL_LIBGCC_SPEC
     By default, if 'ENABLE_SHARED_LIBGCC' is defined, the 'LIBGCC_SPEC'
     is not directly used by the driver program but is instead modified
     to refer to different versions of 'libgcc.a' depending on the
     values of the command line flags '-static', '-shared',
     '-static-libgcc', and '-shared-libgcc'.  On targets where these
     modifications are inappropriate, define 'REAL_LIBGCC_SPEC' instead.
     'REAL_LIBGCC_SPEC' tells the driver how to place a reference to
     'libgcc' on the link command line, but, unlike 'LIBGCC_SPEC', it is
     used unmodified.

 -- Macro: USE_LD_AS_NEEDED
     A macro that controls the modifications to 'LIBGCC_SPEC' mentioned
     in 'REAL_LIBGCC_SPEC'.  If nonzero, a spec will be generated that
     uses '--as-needed' or equivalent options and the shared 'libgcc' in
     place of the static exception handler library, when linking without
     any of '-static', '-static-libgcc', or '-shared-libgcc'.

 -- Macro: LINK_EH_SPEC
     If defined, this C string constant is added to 'LINK_SPEC'.  When
     'USE_LD_AS_NEEDED' is zero or undefined, it also affects the
     modifications to 'LIBGCC_SPEC' mentioned in 'REAL_LIBGCC_SPEC'.

 -- Macro: STARTFILE_SPEC
     Another C string constant used much like 'LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that 'STARTFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very beginning of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C startup file from the usual place.  See 'gcc.c'.

 -- Macro: ENDFILE_SPEC
     Another C string constant used much like 'LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that 'ENDFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very end of the command given to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

 -- Macro: THREAD_MODEL_SPEC
     GCC '-v' will print the thread model GCC was configured to use.
     However, this doesn't work on platforms that are multilibbed on
     thread models, such as AIX 4.3.  On such platforms, define
     'THREAD_MODEL_SPEC' such that it evaluates to a string without
     blanks that names one of the recognized thread models.  '%*', the
     default value of this macro, will expand to the value of
     'thread_file' set in 'config.gcc'.

 -- Macro: SYSROOT_SUFFIX_SPEC
     Define this macro to add a suffix to the target sysroot when GCC is
     configured with a sysroot.  This will cause GCC to search for
     usr/lib, et al, within sysroot+suffix.

 -- Macro: SYSROOT_HEADERS_SUFFIX_SPEC
     Define this macro to add a headers_suffix to the target sysroot
     when GCC is configured with a sysroot.  This will cause GCC to pass
     the updated sysroot+headers_suffix to CPP, causing it to search for
     usr/include, et al, within sysroot+headers_suffix.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_SPECS
     Define this macro to provide additional specifications to put in
     the 'specs' file that can be used in various specifications like
     'CC1_SPEC'.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures,
     containing a string constant, that defines the specification name,
     and a string constant that provides the specification.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

     'EXTRA_SPECS' is useful when an architecture contains several
     related targets, which have various '..._SPECS' which are similar
     to each other, and the maintainer would like one central place to
     keep these definitions.

     For example, the PowerPC System V.4 targets use 'EXTRA_SPECS' to
     define either '_CALL_SYSV' when the System V calling sequence is
     used or '_CALL_AIX' when the older AIX-based calling sequence is
     used.

     The 'config/rs6000/rs6000.h' target file defines:

          #define EXTRA_SPECS \
            { "cpp_sysv_default", CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT },

          #define CPP_SYS_DEFAULT ""

     The 'config/rs6000/sysv.h' target file defines:
          #undef CPP_SPEC
          #define CPP_SPEC \
          "%{posix: -D_POSIX_SOURCE } \
          %{mcall-sysv: -D_CALL_SYSV } \
          %{!mcall-sysv: %(cpp_sysv_default) } \
          %{msoft-float: -D_SOFT_FLOAT} %{mcpu=403: -D_SOFT_FLOAT}"

          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_SYSV"

     while the 'config/rs6000/eabiaix.h' target file defines
     'CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT' as:

          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_AIX"

 -- Macro: LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1
     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
     'libgcc.a'.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program
     will pass the argument '-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search.

 -- Macro: LINK_GCC_C_SEQUENCE_SPEC
     The sequence in which libgcc and libc are specified to the linker.
     By default this is '%G %L %G'.

 -- Macro: LINK_COMMAND_SPEC
     A C string constant giving the complete command line need to
     execute the linker.  When you do this, you will need to update your
     port each time a change is made to the link command line within
     'gcc.c'.  Therefore, define this macro only if you need to
     completely redefine the command line for invoking the linker and
     there is no other way to accomplish the effect you need.
     Overriding this macro may be avoidable by overriding
     'LINK_GCC_C_SEQUENCE_SPEC' instead.

 -- Common Target Hook: bool TARGET_ALWAYS_STRIP_DOTDOT
     True if '..' components should always be removed from directory
     names computed relative to GCC's internal directories, false
     (default) if such components should be preserved and directory
     names containing them passed to other tools such as the linker.

 -- Macro: MULTILIB_DEFAULTS
     Define this macro as a C expression for the initializer of an array
     of string to tell the driver program which options are defaults for
     this target and thus do not need to be handled specially when using
     'MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.

     Do not define this macro if 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is not defined in
     the target makefile fragment or if none of the options listed in
     'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' are set by default.  *Note Target Fragment::.

 -- Macro: RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR
     Define this macro to tell 'gcc' that it should only translate a
     '-B' prefix into a '-L' linker option if the prefix indicates an
     absolute file name.

 -- Macro: MD_EXEC_PREFIX
     If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
     'STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.  'MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     compiler is built as a cross compiler.  If you define
     'MD_EXEC_PREFIX', then be sure to add it to the list of directories
     used to find the assembler in 'configure.in'.

 -- Macro: STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of 'libdir' as the default prefix to try when
     searching for startup files such as 'crt0.o'.
     'STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX' is not searched when the compiler is
     built as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of '/lib' as a prefix to try after the default
     prefix when searching for startup files such as 'crt0.o'.
     'STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1' is not searched when the compiler is
     built as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_2
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of '/lib' as yet another prefix to try after
     the default prefix when searching for startup files such as
     'crt0.o'.  'STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_2' is not searched when the
     compiler is built as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX
     If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after
     the standard prefixes.  'MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     compiler is built as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1
     If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
     standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the compiler is built
     as a cross compiler.

 -- Macro: INIT_ENVIRONMENT
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to set
     environment variables for programs called by the driver, such as
     the assembler and loader.  The driver passes the value of this
     macro to 'putenv' to initialize the necessary environment
     variables.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of '/usr/local/include' as the default prefix
     to try when searching for local header files.  'LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
     comes before 'NATIVE_SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR' (set in 'config.gcc',
     normally '/usr/include') in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not search either '/usr/local/include' or its
     replacement.

 -- Macro: NATIVE_SYSTEM_HEADER_COMPONENT
     The "component" corresponding to 'NATIVE_SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR'.  See
     'INCLUDE_DEFAULTS', below, for the description of components.  If
     you do not define this macro, no component is used.

 -- Macro: INCLUDE_DEFAULTS
     Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default search
     path for include files.  For a native compiler, the default search
     path usually consists of 'GCC_INCLUDE_DIR', 'LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR',
     'GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR', and 'NATIVE_SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR'.  In
     addition, 'GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' and 'GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' are defined
     automatically by 'Makefile', and specify private search areas for
     GCC.  The directory 'GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for C++
     programs.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
     Each array element should have four elements: the directory name (a
     string constant), the component name (also a string constant), a
     flag for C++-only directories, and a flag showing that the includes
     in the directory don't need to be wrapped in 'extern 'C'' when
     compiling C++.  Mark the end of the array with a null element.

     The component name denotes what GNU package the include file is
     part of, if any, in all uppercase letters.  For example, it might
     be 'GCC' or 'BINUTILS'.  If the package is part of a
     vendor-supplied operating system, code the component name as '0'.

     For example, here is the definition used for VAX/VMS:

          #define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
          {                                       \
            { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", "G++", 1, 1},   \
            { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", "GCC", 0, 0},    \
            { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0, 0, 0},  \
            { ".", 0, 0, 0},                      \
            { 0, 0, 0, 0}                         \
          }

 Here is the order of prefixes tried for exec files:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with '-B'.

  2. The environment variable 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' or, if 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'
     is not set and the compiler has not been installed in the
     configure-time PREFIX, the location in which the compiler has
     actually been installed.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     'COMPILER_PATH'.

  4. The macro 'STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX', if the compiler has been
     installed in the configured-time PREFIX.

  5. The location '/usr/libexec/gcc/', but only if this is a native
     compiler.

  6. The location '/usr/lib/gcc/', but only if this is a native
     compiler.

  7. The macro 'MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if defined, but only if this is a
     native compiler.

 Here is the order of prefixes tried for startfiles:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with '-B'.

  2. The environment variable 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' or its automatically
     determined value based on the installed toolchain location.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     'LIBRARY_PATH' (or port-specific name; native only, cross compilers
     do not use this).

  4. The macro 'STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX', but only if the toolchain is
     installed in the configured PREFIX or this is a native compiler.

  5. The location '/usr/lib/gcc/', but only if this is a native
     compiler.

  6. The macro 'MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if defined, but only if this is a
     native compiler.

  7. The macro 'MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX', if defined, but only if this is a
     native compiler, or we have a target system root.

  8. The macro 'MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1', if defined, but only if this is
     a native compiler, or we have a target system root.

  9. The macro 'STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX', with any sysroot
     modifications.  If this path is relative it will be prefixed by
     'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' and the machine suffix or 'STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'
     and the machine suffix.

  10. The macro 'STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1', but only if this is a
     native compiler, or we have a target system root.  The default for
     this macro is '/lib/'.

  11. The macro 'STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_2', but only if this is a
     native compiler, or we have a target system root.  The default for
     this macro is '/usr/lib/'.

17.3 Run-time Target Specification
==================================

Here are run-time target specifications.

 -- Macro: TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS ()
     This function-like macro expands to a block of code that defines
     built-in preprocessor macros and assertions for the target CPU,
     using the functions 'builtin_define', 'builtin_define_std' and
     'builtin_assert'.  When the front end calls this macro it provides
     a trailing semicolon, and since it has finished command line option
     processing your code can use those results freely.

     'builtin_assert' takes a string in the form you pass to the
     command-line option '-A', such as 'cpu=mips', and creates the
     assertion.  'builtin_define' takes a string in the form accepted by
     option '-D' and unconditionally defines the macro.

     'builtin_define_std' takes a string representing the name of an
     object-like macro.  If it doesn't lie in the user's namespace,
     'builtin_define_std' defines it unconditionally.  Otherwise, it
     defines a version with two leading underscores, and another version
     with two leading and trailing underscores, and defines the original
     only if an ISO standard was not requested on the command line.  For
     example, passing 'unix' defines '__unix', '__unix__' and possibly
     'unix'; passing '_mips' defines '__mips', '__mips__' and possibly
     '_mips', and passing '_ABI64' defines only '_ABI64'.

     You can also test for the C dialect being compiled.  The variable
     'c_language' is set to one of 'clk_c', 'clk_cplusplus' or
     'clk_objective_c'.  Note that if we are preprocessing assembler,
     this variable will be 'clk_c' but the function-like macro
     'preprocessing_asm_p()' will return true, so you might want to
     check for that first.  If you need to check for strict ANSI, the
     variable 'flag_iso' can be used.  The function-like macro
     'preprocessing_trad_p()' can be used to check for traditional
     preprocessing.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OS_CPP_BUILTINS ()
     Similarly to 'TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS' but this macro is optional
     and is used for the target operating system instead.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OBJFMT_CPP_BUILTINS ()
     Similarly to 'TARGET_CPU_CPP_BUILTINS' but this macro is optional
     and is used for the target object format.  'elfos.h' uses this
     macro to define '__ELF__', so you probably do not need to define it
     yourself.

 -- Variable: extern int target_flags
     This variable is declared in 'options.h', which is included before
     any target-specific headers.

 -- Common Target Hook: int TARGET_DEFAULT_TARGET_FLAGS
     This variable specifies the initial value of 'target_flags'.  Its
     default setting is 0.

 -- Common Target Hook: bool TARGET_HANDLE_OPTION (struct gcc_options
          *OPTS, struct gcc_options *OPTS_SET, const struct
          cl_decoded_option *DECODED, location_t LOC)
     This hook is called whenever the user specifies one of the
     target-specific options described by the '.opt' definition files
     (*note Options::).  It has the opportunity to do some
     option-specific processing and should return true if the option is
     valid.  The default definition does nothing but return true.

     DECODED specifies the option and its arguments.  OPTS and OPTS_SET
     are the 'gcc_options' structures to be used for storing option
     state, and LOC is the location at which the option was passed
     ('UNKNOWN_LOCATION' except for options passed via attributes).

 -- C Target Hook: bool TARGET_HANDLE_C_OPTION (size_t CODE, const char
          *ARG, int VALUE)
     This target hook is called whenever the user specifies one of the
     target-specific C language family options described by the '.opt'
     definition files(*note Options::).  It has the opportunity to do
     some option-specific processing and should return true if the
     option is valid.  The arguments are like for
     'TARGET_HANDLE_OPTION'.  The default definition does nothing but
     return false.

     In general, you should use 'TARGET_HANDLE_OPTION' to handle
     options.  However, if processing an option requires routines that
     are only available in the C (and related language) front ends, then
     you should use 'TARGET_HANDLE_C_OPTION' instead.

 -- C Target Hook: tree TARGET_OBJC_CONSTRUCT_STRING_OBJECT (tree
          STRING)
     Targets may provide a string object type that can be used within
     and between C, C++ and their respective Objective-C dialects.  A
     string object might, for example, embed encoding and length
     information.  These objects are considered opaque to the compiler
     and handled as references.  An ideal implementation makes the
     composition of the string object match that of the Objective-C
     'NSString' ('NXString' for GNUStep), allowing efficient
     interworking between C-only and Objective-C code.  If a target
     implements string objects then this hook should return a reference
     to such an object constructed from the normal 'C' string
     representation provided in STRING.  At present, the hook is used by
     Objective-C only, to obtain a common-format string object when the
     target provides one.

 -- C Target Hook: void TARGET_OBJC_DECLARE_UNRESOLVED_CLASS_REFERENCE
          (const char *CLASSNAME)
     Declare that Objective C class CLASSNAME is referenced by the
     current TU.

 -- C Target Hook: void TARGET_OBJC_DECLARE_CLASS_DEFINITION (const char
          *CLASSNAME)
     Declare that Objective C class CLASSNAME is defined by the current
     TU.

 -- C Target Hook: bool TARGET_STRING_OBJECT_REF_TYPE_P (const_tree
          STRINGREF)
     If a target implements string objects then this hook should return
     'true' if STRINGREF is a valid reference to such an object.

 -- C Target Hook: void TARGET_CHECK_STRING_OBJECT_FORMAT_ARG (tree
          FORMAT_ARG, tree ARGS_LIST)
     If a target implements string objects then this hook should should
     provide a facility to check the function arguments in ARGS_LIST
     against the format specifiers in FORMAT_ARG where the type of
     FORMAT_ARG is one recognized as a valid string reference type.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_OVERRIDE_OPTIONS_AFTER_CHANGE (void)
     This target function is similar to the hook
     'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE' but is called when the optimize level is
     changed via an attribute or pragma or when it is reset at the end
     of the code affected by the attribute or pragma.  It is not called
     at the beginning of compilation when 'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE' is
     called so if you want to perform these actions then, you should
     have 'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE' call
     'TARGET_OVERRIDE_OPTIONS_AFTER_CHANGE'.

 -- Macro: C_COMMON_OVERRIDE_OPTIONS
     This is similar to the 'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE' hook but is only
     used in the C language frontends (C, Objective-C, C++,
     Objective-C++) and so can be used to alter option flag variables
     which only exist in those frontends.

 -- Common Target Hook: const struct default_options *
          TARGET_OPTION_OPTIMIZATION_TABLE
     Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are performed
     for various optimization levels.  This variable, if defined,
     describes options to enable at particular sets of optimization
     levels.  These options are processed once just after the
     optimization level is determined and before the remainder of the
     command options have been parsed, so may be overridden by other
     options passed explicitly.

     This processing is run once at program startup and when the
     optimization options are changed via '#pragma GCC optimize' or by
     using the 'optimize' attribute.

 -- Common Target Hook: void TARGET_OPTION_INIT_STRUCT (struct
          gcc_options *OPTS)
     Set target-dependent initial values of fields in OPTS.

 -- Common Target Hook: void TARGET_OPTION_DEFAULT_PARAMS (void)
     Set target-dependent default values for '--param' settings, using
     calls to 'set_default_param_value'.

 -- Macro: SWITCHABLE_TARGET
     Some targets need to switch between substantially different
     subtargets during compilation.  For example, the MIPS target has
     one subtarget for the traditional MIPS architecture and another for
     MIPS16.  Source code can switch between these two subarchitectures
     using the 'mips16' and 'nomips16' attributes.

     Such subtargets can differ in things like the set of available
     registers, the set of available instructions, the costs of various
     operations, and so on.  GCC caches a lot of this type of
     information in global variables, and recomputing them for each
     subtarget takes a significant amount of time.  The compiler
     therefore provides a facility for maintaining several versions of
     the global variables and quickly switching between them; see
     'target-globals.h' for details.

     Define this macro to 1 if your target needs this facility.  The
     default is 0.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FLOAT_EXCEPTIONS_ROUNDING_SUPPORTED_P
          (void)
     Returns true if the target supports IEEE 754 floating-point
     exceptions and rounding modes, false otherwise.  This is intended
     to relate to the 'float' and 'double' types, but not necessarily
     'long double'.  By default, returns true if the 'adddf3'
     instruction pattern is available and false otherwise, on the
     assumption that hardware floating point supports exceptions and
     rounding modes but software floating point does not.

17.4 Defining data structures for per-function information.
===========================================================

If the target needs to store information on a per-function basis, GCC
provides a macro and a couple of variables to allow this.  Note, just
using statics to store the information is a bad idea, since GCC supports
nested functions, so you can be halfway through encoding one function
when another one comes along.

 GCC defines a data structure called 'struct function' which contains
all of the data specific to an individual function.  This structure
contains a field called 'machine' whose type is 'struct machine_function
*', which can be used by targets to point to their own specific data.

 If a target needs per-function specific data it should define the type
'struct machine_function' and also the macro 'INIT_EXPANDERS'.  This
macro should be used to initialize the function pointer
'init_machine_status'.  This pointer is explained below.

 One typical use of per-function, target specific data is to create an
RTX to hold the register containing the function's return address.  This
RTX can then be used to implement the '__builtin_return_address'
function, for level 0.

 Note--earlier implementations of GCC used a single data area to hold
all of the per-function information.  Thus when processing of a nested
function began the old per-function data had to be pushed onto a stack,
and when the processing was finished, it had to be popped off the stack.
GCC used to provide function pointers called 'save_machine_status' and
'restore_machine_status' to handle the saving and restoring of the
target specific information.  Since the single data area approach is no
longer used, these pointers are no longer supported.

 -- Macro: INIT_EXPANDERS
     Macro called to initialize any target specific information.  This
     macro is called once per function, before generation of any RTL has
     begun.  The intention of this macro is to allow the initialization
     of the function pointer 'init_machine_status'.

 -- Variable: void (*)(struct function *) init_machine_status
     If this function pointer is non-'NULL' it will be called once per
     function, before function compilation starts, in order to allow the
     target to perform any target specific initialization of the 'struct
     function' structure.  It is intended that this would be used to
     initialize the 'machine' of that structure.

     'struct machine_function' structures are expected to be freed by
     GC.  Generally, any memory that they reference must be allocated by
     using GC allocation, including the structure itself.

17.5 Storage Layout
===================

Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are sizes or
alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They can be C
expressions that refer to static variables, such as the 'target_flags'.
*Note Run-time Target::.

 -- Macro: BITS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit
     in a byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the
     value zero.  This means that bit-field instructions count from the
     most significant bit.  If the machine has no bit-field
     instructions, then this must still be defined, but it doesn't
     matter which value it is defined to.  This macro need not be a
     constant.

     This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
     bytes or words; that is controlled by 'BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'.

 -- Macro: BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant byte
     in a word has the lowest number.  This macro need not be a
     constant.

 -- Macro: WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object,
     the most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to
     both memory locations and registers; see 'REG_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' if
     the order of words in memory is not the same as the order in
     registers.  This macro need not be a constant.

 -- Macro: REG_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
     On some machines, the order of words in a multiword object differs
     between registers in memory.  In such a situation, define this
     macro to describe the order of words in a register.  The macro
     'WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' controls the order of words in memory.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if 'DFmode', 'XFmode' or
     'TFmode' floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
     containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it
     to have the value 0.  This macro need not be a constant.

     You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
     multi-word integers.

 -- Macro: BITS_PER_WORD
     Number of bits in a word.  If you do not define this macro, the
     default is 'BITS_PER_UNIT * UNITS_PER_WORD'.

 -- Macro: MAX_BITS_PER_WORD
     Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is 'BITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the largest value that 'BITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

 -- Macro: UNITS_PER_WORD
     Number of storage units in a word; normally the size of a
     general-purpose register, a power of two from 1 or 8.

 -- Macro: MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD
     Minimum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is 'UNITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the smallest value that 'UNITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

 -- Macro: POINTER_SIZE
     Width of a pointer, in bits.  You must specify a value no wider
     than the width of 'Pmode'.  If it is not equal to the width of
     'Pmode', you must define 'POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED'.  If you do not
     specify a value the default is 'BITS_PER_WORD'.

 -- Macro: POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED
     A C expression that determines how pointers should be extended from
     'ptr_mode' to either 'Pmode' or 'word_mode'.  It is greater than
     zero if pointers should be zero-extended, zero if they should be
     sign-extended, and negative if some other sort of conversion is
     needed.  In the last case, the extension is done by the target's
     'ptr_extend' instruction.

     You need not define this macro if the 'ptr_mode', 'Pmode' and
     'word_mode' are all the same width.

 -- Macro: PROMOTE_MODE (M, UNSIGNEDP, TYPE)
     A macro to update M and UNSIGNEDP when an object whose type is TYPE
     and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be stored in
     a register.  This macro is only called when TYPE is a scalar type.

     On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on a
     full register, define this macro to set M to 'word_mode' if M is an
     integer mode narrower than 'BITS_PER_WORD'.  In most cases, only
     integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
     floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their
     narrower counterparts.

     For most machines, the macro definition does not change UNSIGNEDP.
     However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially
     handle either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For
     example, on the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add
     instructions sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines,
     set UNSIGNEDP according to which kind of extension is more
     efficient.

     Do not define this macro if it would never modify M.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_MODE
          (const_tree TYPE, enum machine_mode MODE, int *PUNSIGNEDP,
          const_tree FUNTYPE, int FOR_RETURN)
     Like 'PROMOTE_MODE', but it is applied to outgoing function
     arguments or function return values.  The target hook should return
     the new mode and possibly change '*PUNSIGNEDP' if the promotion
     should change signedness.  This function is called only for scalar
     _or pointer_ types.

     FOR_RETURN allows to distinguish the promotion of arguments and
     return values.  If it is '1', a return value is being promoted and
     'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE' must perform the same promotions done here.
     If it is '2', the returned mode should be that of the register in
     which an incoming parameter is copied, or the outgoing result is
     computed; then the hook should return the same mode as
     'promote_mode', though the signedness may be different.

     TYPE can be NULL when promoting function arguments of libcalls.

     The default is to not promote arguments and return values.  You can
     also define the hook to
     'default_promote_function_mode_always_promote' if you would like to
     apply the same rules given by 'PROMOTE_MODE'.

 -- Macro: PARM_BOUNDARY
     Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
     bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
     regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
     size of an integer.

 -- Macro: STACK_BOUNDARY
     Define this macro to the minimum alignment enforced by hardware for
     the stack pointer on this machine.  The definition is a C
     expression for the desired alignment (measured in bits).  This
     value is used as a default if 'PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY' is not
     defined.  On most machines, this should be the same as
     'PARM_BOUNDARY'.

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY
     Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
     the stack pointer, greater than what the hardware enforces.  The
     definition is a C expression for the desired alignment (measured in
     bits).  This macro must evaluate to a value equal to or larger than
     'STACK_BOUNDARY'.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_STACK_BOUNDARY
     Define this macro if the incoming stack boundary may be different
     from 'PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY'.  This macro must evaluate to a
     value equal to or larger than 'STACK_BOUNDARY'.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_BOUNDARY
     Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

 -- Macro: BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine,
     in bits.  Note that this is not the biggest alignment that is
     supported, just the biggest alignment that, when violated, may
     cause a fault.

 -- Macro: MALLOC_ABI_ALIGNMENT
     Alignment, in bits, a C conformant malloc implementation has to
     provide.  If not defined, the default value is 'BITS_PER_WORD'.

 -- Macro: ATTRIBUTE_ALIGNED_VALUE
     Alignment used by the '__attribute__ ((aligned))' construct.  If
     not defined, the default value is 'BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.

 -- Macro: MINIMUM_ATOMIC_ALIGNMENT
     If defined, the smallest alignment, in bits, that can be given to
     an object that can be referenced in one operation, without
     disturbing any nearby object.  Normally, this is 'BITS_PER_UNIT',
     but may be larger on machines that don't have byte or half-word
     store operations.

 -- Macro: BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest alignment that any structure or union field can require on
     this machine, in bits.  If defined, this overrides
     'BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT' for structure and union fields only, unless the
     field alignment has been set by the '__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))'
     construct.

 -- Macro: ADJUST_FIELD_ALIGN (FIELD, COMPUTED)
     An expression for the alignment of a structure field FIELD if the
     alignment computed in the usual way (including applying of
     'BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT' and 'BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT' to the alignment)
     is COMPUTED.  It overrides alignment only if the field alignment
     has not been set by the '__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))' construct.

 -- Macro: MAX_STACK_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest stack alignment guaranteed by the backend.  Use this macro
     to specify the maximum alignment of a variable on stack.

     If not defined, the default value is 'STACK_BOUNDARY'.

 -- Macro: MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT
     Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this
     machine.  Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be
     specified using the '__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))' construct.  If
     not defined, the default value is 'BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.

     On systems that use ELF, the default (in 'config/elfos.h') is the
     largest supported 32-bit ELF section alignment representable on a
     32-bit host e.g.  '(((unsigned HOST_WIDEST_INT) 1 << 28) * 8)'.  On
     32-bit ELF the largest supported section alignment in bits is
     '(0x80000000 * 8)', but this is not representable on 32-bit hosts.

 -- Macro: DATA_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variable
     in the static store.  TYPE is the data type, and BASIC-ALIGN is the
     alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
     macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause
     character arrays to be word-aligned so that 'strcpy' calls that
     copy constants to character arrays can be done inline.

 -- Macro: DATA_ABI_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)
     Similar to 'DATA_ALIGNMENT', but for the cases where the ABI
     mandates some alignment increase, instead of optimization only
     purposes.  E.g. AMD x86-64 psABI says that variables with array
     type larger than 15 bytes must be aligned to 16 byte boundaries.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (CONSTANT, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a
     constant that is being placed in memory.  CONSTANT is the constant
     and BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
     align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
     constants to be word aligned so that 'strcpy' calls that copy
     constants can be done inline.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variable
     in the local store.  TYPE is the data type, and BASIC-ALIGN is the
     alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
     macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.

     If the value of this macro has a type, it should be an unsigned
     type.

 -- Target Hook: HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_VECTOR_ALIGNMENT (const_tree TYPE)
     This hook can be used to define the alignment for a vector of type
     TYPE, in order to comply with a platform ABI. The default is to
     require natural alignment for vector types.  The alignment returned
     by this hook must be a power-of-two multiple of the default
     alignment of the vector element type.

 -- Macro: STACK_SLOT_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, MODE, BASIC-ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for stack slot.
     TYPE is the data type, MODE is the widest mode available, and
     BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the slot would ordinarily have.
     The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to align
     the slot.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used when TYPE is
     'NULL'.  Otherwise, 'LOCAL_ALIGNMENT' will be used.

     This macro is to set alignment of stack slot to the maximum
     alignment of all possible modes which the slot may have.

     If the value of this macro has a type, it should be an unsigned
     type.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_DECL_ALIGNMENT (DECL)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a local
     variable DECL.

     If this macro is not defined, then 'LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (TREE_TYPE
     (DECL), DECL_ALIGN (DECL))' is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.

     If the value of this macro has a type, it should be an unsigned
     type.

 -- Macro: MINIMUM_ALIGNMENT (EXP, MODE, ALIGN)
     If defined, a C expression to compute the minimum required
     alignment for dynamic stack realignment purposes for EXP (a type or
     decl), MODE, assuming normal alignment ALIGN.

     If this macro is not defined, then ALIGN will be used.

 -- Macro: EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY
     Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit-field that follows
     an empty field such as 'int : 0;'.

     If 'PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' is true, it overrides this macro.

 -- Macro: STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY
     Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a
     multiple of.  Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a
     multiple of this.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
     'BITS_PER_UNIT'.

 -- Macro: STRICT_ALIGNMENT
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to
     work if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions
     will merely go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.

 -- Macro: PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS
     Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers
     handle alignment of bit-fields and the structures that contain
     them.

     The behavior is that the type written for a named bit-field ('int',
     'short', or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the entire
     structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary field
     of that type.  In addition, the bit-field is placed within the
     structure so that it would fit within such a field, not crossing a
     boundary for it.

     Thus, on most machines, a named bit-field whose type is written as
     'int' would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force
     four-byte alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used
     may not be four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment
     parameters.)

     An unnamed bit-field will not affect the alignment of the
     containing structure.

     If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression; a
     nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

     Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
     bit-fields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The
     compiler can support such references if there are 'insv', 'extv',
     and 'extzv' insns that can directly reference memory.

     The other known way of making bit-fields work is to define
     'STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as 'BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then
     every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

     Unless the machine has bit-field instructions or you define
     'STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
     'PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.

     If your aim is to make GCC use the same conventions for laying out
     bit-fields as are used by another compiler, here is how to
     investigate what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this
     program:

          struct foo1
          {
            char x;
            char :0;
            char y;
          };

          struct foo2
          {
            char x;
            int :0;
            char y;
          };

          main ()
          {
            printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo1));
            printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo2));
            exit (0);
          }

     If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you
     would get from 'PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.

 -- Macro: BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED
     Like 'PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' except that its effect is limited
     to aligning a bit-field within the structure.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ALIGN_ANON_BITFIELD (void)
     When 'PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' is true this hook will determine
     whether unnamed bitfields affect the alignment of the containing
     structure.  The hook should return true if the structure should
     inherit the alignment requirements of an unnamed bitfield's type.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_NARROW_VOLATILE_BITFIELD (void)
     This target hook should return 'true' if accesses to volatile
     bitfields should use the narrowest mode possible.  It should return
     'false' if these accesses should use the bitfield container type.

     The default is 'false'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_MEMBER_TYPE_FORCES_BLK (const_tree FIELD,
          enum machine_mode MODE)
     Return true if a structure, union or array containing FIELD should
     be accessed using 'BLKMODE'.

     If FIELD is the only field in the structure, MODE is its mode,
     otherwise MODE is VOIDmode.  MODE is provided in the case where
     structures of one field would require the structure's mode to
     retain the field's mode.

     Normally, this is not needed.

 -- Macro: ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (TYPE, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)
     Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a type
     (given by TYPE as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the
     usual way is COMPUTED and the alignment explicitly specified was
     SPECIFIED.

     The default is to use SPECIFIED if it is larger; otherwise, use the
     smaller of COMPUTED and 'BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'

 -- Macro: MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE
     An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
     machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine
     modes of this size or smaller can be used for structures and unions
     with the appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined,
     'GET_MODE_BITSIZE (DImode)' is assumed.

 -- Macro: STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE (SAVE_LEVEL)
     If defined, an expression of type 'enum machine_mode' that
     specifies the mode of the save area operand of a 'save_stack_LEVEL'
     named pattern (*note Standard Names::).  SAVE_LEVEL is one of
     'SAVE_BLOCK', 'SAVE_FUNCTION', or 'SAVE_NONLOCAL' and selects which
     of the three named patterns is having its mode specified.

     You need not define this macro if it always returns 'Pmode'.  You
     would most commonly define this macro if the 'save_stack_LEVEL'
     patterns need to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

 -- Macro: STACK_SIZE_MODE
     If defined, an expression of type 'enum machine_mode' that
     specifies the mode of the size increment operand of an
     'allocate_stack' named pattern (*note Standard Names::).

     You need not define this macro if it always returns 'word_mode'.
     You would most commonly define this macro if the 'allocate_stack'
     pattern needs to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_LIBGCC_CMP_RETURN_MODE (void)
     This target hook should return the mode to be used for the return
     value of compare instructions expanded to libgcc calls.  If not
     defined 'word_mode' is returned which is the right choice for a
     majority of targets.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_LIBGCC_SHIFT_COUNT_MODE (void)
     This target hook should return the mode to be used for the shift
     count operand of shift instructions expanded to libgcc calls.  If
     not defined 'word_mode' is returned which is the right choice for a
     majority of targets.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_UNWIND_WORD_MODE (void)
     Return machine mode to be used for '_Unwind_Word' type.  The
     default is to use 'word_mode'.

 -- Macro: ROUND_TOWARDS_ZERO
     If defined, this macro should be true if the prevailing rounding
     mode is towards zero.

     Defining this macro only affects the way 'libgcc.a' emulates
     floating-point arithmetic.

     Not defining this macro is equivalent to returning zero.

 -- Macro: LARGEST_EXPONENT_IS_NORMAL (SIZE)
     This macro should return true if floats with SIZE bits do not have
     a NaN or infinity representation, but use the largest exponent for
     normal numbers instead.

     Defining this macro only affects the way 'libgcc.a' emulates
     floating-point arithmetic.

     The default definition of this macro returns false for all sizes.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_MS_BITFIELD_LAYOUT_P (const_tree
          RECORD_TYPE)
     This target hook returns 'true' if bit-fields in the given
     RECORD_TYPE are to be laid out following the rules of Microsoft
     Visual C/C++, namely: (i) a bit-field won't share the same storage
     unit with the previous bit-field if their underlying types have
     different sizes, and the bit-field will be aligned to the highest
     alignment of the underlying types of itself and of the previous
     bit-field; (ii) a zero-sized bit-field will affect the alignment of
     the whole enclosing structure, even if it is unnamed; except that
     (iii) a zero-sized bit-field will be disregarded unless it follows
     another bit-field of nonzero size.  If this hook returns 'true',
     other macros that control bit-field layout are ignored.

     When a bit-field is inserted into a packed record, the whole size
     of the underlying type is used by one or more same-size adjacent
     bit-fields (that is, if its long:3, 32 bits is used in the record,
     and any additional adjacent long bit-fields are packed into the
     same chunk of 32 bits.  However, if the size changes, a new field
     of that size is allocated).  In an unpacked record, this is the
     same as using alignment, but not equivalent when packing.

     If both MS bit-fields and '__attribute__((packed))' are used, the
     latter will take precedence.  If '__attribute__((packed))' is used
     on a single field when MS bit-fields are in use, it will take
     precedence for that field, but the alignment of the rest of the
     structure may affect its placement.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_DECIMAL_FLOAT_SUPPORTED_P (void)
     Returns true if the target supports decimal floating point.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FIXED_POINT_SUPPORTED_P (void)
     Returns true if the target supports fixed-point arithmetic.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_EXPAND_TO_RTL_HOOK (void)
     This hook is called just before expansion into rtl, allowing the
     target to perform additional initializations or analysis before the
     expansion.  For example, the rs6000 port uses it to allocate a
     scratch stack slot for use in copying SDmode values between memory
     and floating point registers whenever the function being expanded
     has any SDmode usage.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INSTANTIATE_DECLS (void)
     This hook allows the backend to perform additional instantiations
     on rtl that are not actually in any insns yet, but will be later.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_MANGLE_TYPE (const_tree TYPE)
     If your target defines any fundamental types, or any types your
     target uses should be mangled differently from the default, define
     this hook to return the appropriate encoding for these types as
     part of a C++ mangled name.  The TYPE argument is the tree
     structure representing the type to be mangled.  The hook may be
     applied to trees which are not target-specific fundamental types;
     it should return 'NULL' for all such types, as well as arguments it
     does not recognize.  If the return value is not 'NULL', it must
     point to a statically-allocated string constant.

     Target-specific fundamental types might be new fundamental types or
     qualified versions of ordinary fundamental types.  Encode new
     fundamental types as 'u N NAME', where NAME is the name used for
     the type in source code, and N is the length of NAME in decimal.
     Encode qualified versions of ordinary types as 'U N NAME CODE',
     where NAME is the name used for the type qualifier in source code,
     N is the length of NAME as above, and CODE is the code used to
     represent the unqualified version of this type.  (See
     'write_builtin_type' in 'cp/mangle.c' for the list of codes.)  In
     both cases the spaces are for clarity; do not include any spaces in
     your string.

     This hook is applied to types prior to typedef resolution.  If the
     mangled name for a particular type depends only on that type's main
     variant, you can perform typedef resolution yourself using
     'TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT' before mangling.

     The default version of this hook always returns 'NULL', which is
     appropriate for a target that does not define any new fundamental
     types.

17.6 Layout of Source Language Data Types
=========================================

These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the standard
basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the macros in
the previous section, these apply to specific features of C and related
languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage layout.

 -- Macro: INT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'int' on the target
     machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

 -- Macro: SHORT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'short' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a
     word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded
     up to one unit.)

 -- Macro: LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

 -- Macro: ADA_LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     On some machines, the size used for the Ada equivalent of the type
     'long' by a native Ada compiler differs from that used by C.  In
     that situation, define this macro to be a C expression to be used
     for the size of that type.  If you don't define this, the default
     is the value of 'LONG_TYPE_SIZE'.

 -- Macro: LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.  If you want to support GNU Ada on your machine, the value
     of this macro must be at least 64.

 -- Macro: CHAR_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'char' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT'.

 -- Macro: BOOL_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the C++ type 'bool' and C99
     type '_Bool' on the target machine.  If you don't define this, and
     you probably shouldn't, the default is 'CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'float' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

 -- Macro: DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'double' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

 -- Macro: LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long double' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

 -- Macro: SHORT_FRACT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'short _Fract' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT'.

 -- Macro: FRACT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type '_Fract' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 2'.

 -- Macro: LONG_FRACT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long _Fract' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 4'.

 -- Macro: LONG_LONG_FRACT_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long long _Fract'
     on the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 8'.

 -- Macro: SHORT_ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'short _Accum' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 2'.

 -- Macro: ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type '_Accum' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 4'.

 -- Macro: LONG_ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long _Accum' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 8'.

 -- Macro: LONG_LONG_ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type 'long long _Accum'
     on the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'BITS_PER_UNIT * 16'.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE
     Define this macro if 'LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is not constant or if
     you want routines in 'libgcc2.a' for a size other than
     'LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  If you don't define this, the default is
     'LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_HAS_DF_MODE
     Define this macro if neither 'DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' nor
     'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is 'DFmode' but you want 'DFmode'
     routines in 'libgcc2.a' anyway.  If you don't define this and
     either 'DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' or 'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is 64
     then the default is 1, otherwise it is 0.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_HAS_XF_MODE
     Define this macro if 'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is not
     'XFmode' but you want 'XFmode' routines in 'libgcc2.a' anyway.  If
     you don't define this and 'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is 80
     then the default is 1, otherwise it is 0.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_HAS_TF_MODE
     Define this macro if 'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is not
     'TFmode' but you want 'TFmode' routines in 'libgcc2.a' anyway.  If
     you don't define this and 'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is 128
     then the default is 1, otherwise it is 0.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_GNU_PREFIX
     This macro corresponds to the 'TARGET_LIBFUNC_GNU_PREFIX' target
     hook and should be defined if that hook is overriden to be true.
     It causes function names in libgcc to be changed to use a '__gnu_'
     prefix for their name rather than the default '__'.  A port which
     uses this macro should also arrange to use 't-gnu-prefix' in the
     libgcc 'config.host'.

 -- Macro: SF_SIZE
 -- Macro: DF_SIZE
 -- Macro: XF_SIZE
 -- Macro: TF_SIZE
     Define these macros to be the size in bits of the mantissa of
     'SFmode', 'DFmode', 'XFmode' and 'TFmode' values, if the defaults
     in 'libgcc2.h' are inappropriate.  By default, 'FLT_MANT_DIG' is
     used for 'SF_SIZE', 'LDBL_MANT_DIG' for 'XF_SIZE' and 'TF_SIZE',
     and 'DBL_MANT_DIG' or 'LDBL_MANT_DIG' for 'DF_SIZE' according to
     whether 'DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' or 'LIBGCC2_LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is
     64.

 -- Macro: TARGET_FLT_EVAL_METHOD
     A C expression for the value for 'FLT_EVAL_METHOD' in 'float.h',
     assuming, if applicable, that the floating-point control word is in
     its default state.  If you do not define this macro the value of
     'FLT_EVAL_METHOD' will be zero.

 -- Macro: WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point
     format supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you
     must specify a value less than or equal to the value of
     'LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  If you do not define this macro, the
     value of 'LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is the default.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR
     An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
     'char' should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
     always override this default with the options '-fsigned-char' and
     '-funsigned-char'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS (void)
     This target hook should return true if the compiler should give an
     'enum' type only as many bytes as it takes to represent the range
     of possible values of that type.  It should return false if all
     'enum' types should be allocated like 'int'.

     The default is to return false.

 -- Macro: SIZE_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to
     use for size values.  The typedef name 'size_t' is defined using
     the contents of the string.

     The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate them
     with spaces, and write first any length keyword, then 'unsigned' if
     appropriate, and finally 'int'.  The string must exactly match one
     of the data type names defined in the function
     'c_common_nodes_and_builtins' in the file 'c-family/c-common.c'.
     You may not omit 'int' or change the order--that would cause the
     compiler to crash on startup.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is '"long unsigned
     int"'.

 -- Macro: SIZETYPE
     GCC defines internal types ('sizetype', 'ssizetype', 'bitsizetype'
     and 'sbitsizetype') for expressions dealing with size.  This macro
     is a C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     from which the precision of 'sizetype' is extracted.

     The string has the same restrictions as 'SIZE_TYPE' string.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is 'SIZE_TYPE'.

 -- Macro: PTRDIFF_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to
     use for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef name
     'ptrdiff_t' is defined using the contents of the string.  See
     'SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is '"long int"'.

 -- Macro: WCHAR_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to
     use for wide characters.  The typedef name 'wchar_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.  See 'SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is '"int"'.

 -- Macro: WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  This is used in 'cpp', which cannot make use of
     'WCHAR_TYPE'.

 -- Macro: WINT_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to
     use for wide characters passed to 'printf' and returned from
     'getwc'.  The typedef name 'wint_t' is defined using the contents
     of the string.  See 'SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is '"unsigned int"'.

 -- Macro: INTMAX_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     that can represent any value of any standard or extended signed
     integer type.  The typedef name 'intmax_t' is defined using the
     contents of the string.  See 'SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is the first of
     '"int"', '"long int"', or '"long long int"' that has as much
     precision as 'long long int'.

 -- Macro: UINTMAX_TYPE
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     that can represent any value of any standard or extended unsigned
     integer type.  The typedef name 'uintmax_t' is defined using the
     contents of the string.  See 'SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is the first of
     '"unsigned int"', '"long unsigned int"', or '"long long unsigned
     int"' that has as much precision as 'long long unsigned int'.

 -- Macro: SIG_ATOMIC_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT8_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT16_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT32_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT64_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT8_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT16_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT32_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT64_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_LEAST8_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_LEAST16_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_LEAST32_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_LEAST64_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_LEAST8_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_LEAST16_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_LEAST32_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_LEAST64_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_FAST8_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_FAST16_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_FAST32_TYPE
 -- Macro: INT_FAST64_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_FAST8_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_FAST16_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_FAST32_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINT_FAST64_TYPE
 -- Macro: INTPTR_TYPE
 -- Macro: UINTPTR_TYPE
     C expressions for the standard types 'sig_atomic_t', 'int8_t',
     'int16_t', 'int32_t', 'int64_t', 'uint8_t', 'uint16_t', 'uint32_t',
     'uint64_t', 'int_least8_t', 'int_least16_t', 'int_least32_t',
     'int_least64_t', 'uint_least8_t', 'uint_least16_t',
     'uint_least32_t', 'uint_least64_t', 'int_fast8_t', 'int_fast16_t',
     'int_fast32_t', 'int_fast64_t', 'uint_fast8_t', 'uint_fast16_t',
     'uint_fast32_t', 'uint_fast64_t', 'intptr_t', and 'uintptr_t'.  See
     'SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If any of these macros evaluates to a null pointer, the
     corresponding type is not supported; if GCC is configured to
     provide '<stdint.h>' in such a case, the header provided may not
     conform to C99, depending on the type in question.  The defaults
     for all of these macros are null pointers.

 -- Macro: TARGET_PTRMEMFUNC_VBIT_LOCATION
     The C++ compiler represents a pointer-to-member-function with a
     struct that looks like:

            struct {
              union {
                void (*fn)();
                ptrdiff_t vtable_index;
              };
              ptrdiff_t delta;
            };

     The C++ compiler must use one bit to indicate whether the function
     that will be called through a pointer-to-member-function is
     virtual.  Normally, we assume that the low-order bit of a function
     pointer must always be zero.  Then, by ensuring that the
     vtable_index is odd, we can distinguish which variant of the union
     is in use.  But, on some platforms function pointers can be odd,
     and so this doesn't work.  In that case, we use the low-order bit
     of the 'delta' field, and shift the remainder of the 'delta' field
     to the left.

     GCC will automatically make the right selection about where to
     store this bit using the 'FUNCTION_BOUNDARY' setting for your
     platform.  However, some platforms such as ARM/Thumb have
     'FUNCTION_BOUNDARY' set such that functions always start at even
     addresses, but the lowest bit of pointers to functions indicate
     whether the function at that address is in ARM or Thumb mode.  If
     this is the case of your architecture, you should define this macro
     to 'ptrmemfunc_vbit_in_delta'.

     In general, you should not have to define this macro.  On
     architectures in which function addresses are always even,
     according to 'FUNCTION_BOUNDARY', GCC will automatically define
     this macro to 'ptrmemfunc_vbit_in_pfn'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_VTABLE_USES_DESCRIPTORS
     Normally, the C++ compiler uses function pointers in vtables.  This
     macro allows the target to change to use "function descriptors"
     instead.  Function descriptors are found on targets for whom a
     function pointer is actually a small data structure.  Normally the
     data structure consists of the actual code address plus a data
     pointer to which the function's data is relative.

     If vtables are used, the value of this macro should be the number
     of words that the function descriptor occupies.

 -- Macro: TARGET_VTABLE_ENTRY_ALIGN
     By default, the vtable entries are void pointers, the so the
     alignment is the same as pointer alignment.  The value of this
     macro specifies the alignment of the vtable entry in bits.  It
     should be defined only when special alignment is necessary.  */

 -- Macro: TARGET_VTABLE_DATA_ENTRY_DISTANCE
     There are a few non-descriptor entries in the vtable at offsets
     below zero.  If these entries must be padded (say, to preserve the
     alignment specified by 'TARGET_VTABLE_ENTRY_ALIGN'), set this to
     the number of words in each data entry.

17.7.1 Basic Characteristics of Registers
-----------------------------------------

Registers have various characteristics.

 -- Macro: FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER
     Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
     numbers 0 through 'FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1'; thus, the first pseudo
     register's number really is assigned the number
     'FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.

 -- Macro: FIXED_REGISTERS
     An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed
     purposes all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not
     available for general allocation.  These would include the stack
     pointer, the frame pointer (except on machines where that can be
     used as a general register when no frame pointer is needed), the
     program counter on machines where that is considered one of the
     addressable registers, and any other numbered register with a
     standard use.

     This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated
     by commas and surrounded by braces.  The Nth number is 1 if
     register N is fixed, 0 otherwise.

     The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
     the following one, may be overridden at run time either
     automatically, by the actions of the macro
     'CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE', or by the user with the command
     options '-ffixed-REG', '-fcall-used-REG' and '-fcall-saved-REG'.

 -- Macro: CALL_USED_REGISTERS
     Like 'FIXED_REGISTERS' but has 1 for each register that is
     clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
     registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are
     not available for general allocation of values that must live
     across function calls.

     If a register has 0 in 'CALL_USED_REGISTERS', the compiler
     automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on
     function exit, if the register is used within the function.

 -- Macro: CALL_REALLY_USED_REGISTERS
     Like 'CALL_USED_REGISTERS' except this macro doesn't require that
     the entire set of 'FIXED_REGISTERS' be included.
     ('CALL_USED_REGISTERS' must be a superset of 'FIXED_REGISTERS').
     This macro is optional.  If not specified, it defaults to the value
     of 'CALL_USED_REGISTERS'.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_CALL_PART_CLOBBERED (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is not permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO across a call
     without some part of it being clobbered.  For most machines this
     macro need not be defined.  It is only required for machines that
     do not preserve the entire contents of a register across a call.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE (void)
     This hook may conditionally modify five variables 'fixed_regs',
     'call_used_regs', 'global_regs', 'reg_names', and
     'reg_class_contents', to take into account any dependence of these
     register sets on target flags.  The first three of these are of
     type 'char []' (interpreted as Boolean vectors).  'global_regs' is
     a 'const char *[]', and 'reg_class_contents' is a 'HARD_REG_SET'.
     Before the macro is called, 'fixed_regs', 'call_used_regs',
     'reg_class_contents', and 'reg_names' have been initialized from
     'FIXED_REGISTERS', 'CALL_USED_REGISTERS', 'REG_CLASS_CONTENTS', and
     'REGISTER_NAMES', respectively.  'global_regs' has been cleared,
     and any '-ffixed-REG', '-fcall-used-REG' and '-fcall-saved-REG'
     command options have been applied.

     If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
     flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
     'fixed_regs' and 'call_used_regs' to 1 for each of the registers in
     the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define the macro
     'REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' / 'REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT' to return
     'NO_REGS' if it is called with a letter for a class that shouldn't
     be used.

     (However, if this class is not included in 'GENERAL_REGS' and all
     of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
     controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid
     using these registers when the target switches are opposed to
     them.)

 -- Macro: INCOMING_REGNO (OUT)
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This
     C expression returns the register number as seen by the called
     function corresponding to the register number OUT as seen by the
     calling function.  Return OUT if register number OUT is not an
     outbound register.

 -- Macro: OUTGOING_REGNO (IN)
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This
     C expression returns the register number as seen by the calling
     function corresponding to the register number IN as seen by the
     called function.  Return IN if register number IN is not an inbound
     register.

 -- Macro: LOCAL_REGNO (REGNO)
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This
     C expression returns true if the register is call-saved but is in
     the register window.  Unlike most call-saved registers, such
     registers need not be explicitly restored on function exit or
     during non-local gotos.

 -- Macro: PC_REGNUM
     If the program counter has a register number, define this as that
     register number.  Otherwise, do not define it.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Allocation Order,  Next: Values in Registers,  Prev: Register Basics,  Up: Registers

17.7.2 Order of Allocation of Registers
---------------------------------------

Registers are allocated in order.

 -- Macro: REG_ALLOC_ORDER
     If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
     numbers of hard registers in the order in which GCC should prefer
     to use them (from most preferred to least).

     If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered
     first (all else being equal).

     One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
     registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
     instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On
     such machines, define 'REG_ALLOC_ORDER' to be an initializer that
     lists the highest numbered allocable register first.

 -- Macro: ADJUST_REG_ALLOC_ORDER
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to
     allocate hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic
     block.

     Store the desired register order in the array 'reg_alloc_order'.
     Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the
     next register; and so on.

     The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
     'reg_alloc_order' before execution of the macro.

     On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.

 -- Macro: HONOR_REG_ALLOC_ORDER
     Normally, IRA tries to estimate the costs for saving a register in
     the prologue and restoring it in the epilogue.  This discourages it
     from using call-saved registers.  If a machine wants to ensure that
     IRA allocates registers in the order given by REG_ALLOC_ORDER even
     if some call-saved registers appear earlier than call-used ones,
     this macro should be defined.

 -- Macro: IRA_HARD_REGNO_ADD_COST_MULTIPLIER (REGNO)
     In some case register allocation order is not enough for the
     Integrated Register Allocator (IRA) to generate a good code.  If
     this macro is defined, it should return a floating point value
     based on REGNO.  The cost of using REGNO for a pseudo will be
     increased by approximately the pseudo's usage frequency times the
     value returned by this macro.  Not defining this macro is
     equivalent to having it always return '0.0'.

     On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Values in Registers,  Next: Leaf Functions,  Prev: Allocation Order,  Up: Registers

17.7.3 How Values Fit in Registers
----------------------------------

This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers,
     starting at register number REGNO, required to hold a value of mode
     MODE.  This macro must never return zero, even if a register cannot
     hold the requested mode - indicate that with HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK
     and/or CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS instead.

     On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
     definition of this macro is

          #define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
             ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
              / UNITS_PER_WORD)

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_NREGS_HAS_PADDING (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode MODE, stored in
     memory, ends with padding that causes it to take up more space than
     in registers starting at register number REGNO (as determined by
     multiplying GCC's notion of the size of the register when
     containing this mode by the number of registers returned by
     'HARD_REGNO_NREGS').  By default this is zero.

     For example, if a floating-point value is stored in three 32-bit
     registers but takes up 128 bits in memory, then this would be
     nonzero.

     This macros only needs to be defined if there are cases where
     'subreg_get_info' would otherwise wrongly determine that a 'subreg'
     can be represented by an offset to the register number, when in
     fact such a 'subreg' would contain some of the padding not stored
     in registers and so not be representable.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_NREGS_WITH_PADDING (REGNO, MODE)
     For values of REGNO and MODE for which
     'HARD_REGNO_NREGS_HAS_PADDING' returns nonzero, a C expression
     returning the greater number of registers required to hold the
     value including any padding.  In the example above, the value would
     be four.

 -- Macro: REGMODE_NATURAL_SIZE (MODE)
     Define this macro if the natural size of registers that hold values
     of mode MODE is not the word size.  It is a C expression that
     should give the natural size in bytes for the specified mode.  It
     is used by the register allocator to try to optimize its results.
     This happens for example on SPARC 64-bit where the natural size of
     floating-point registers is still 32-bit.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (REGNO, MODE)
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several
     registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all
     registers are equivalent, a suitable definition is

          #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

     You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed
     registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them to be
     always occupied.

     On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
     register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to
     reject odd register numbers for such modes.

     The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that
     the 'movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the
     register and other hard register in the same class and that moving
     a value into the register and back out not alter it.

     Since the same instruction used to move 'word_mode' will work for
     all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
     'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' to distinguish between these modes, provided
     you define patterns 'movhi', etc., to take advantage of this.  This
     is useful because of the interaction between 'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
     and 'MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for all integer modes
     to be tieable.

     Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
     Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed
     only in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers
     that can hold integers can safely _hold_ a floating point machine
     mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done on it in those
     registers.  Integer move instructions can be used to move the
     values.

     On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
     modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the
     floating registers normalize any value stored in them, because
     storing a non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
     'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject fixed-point machine modes in
     floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not
     automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one
     and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may
     go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say so.

     The primary significance of special floating registers is rather
     that they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
     instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
     'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by writing the proper
     constraints for those instructions.

     On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to
     access, so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than
     in such a register if floating point arithmetic is not being done.
     As long as the floating registers are not in class 'GENERAL_REGS',
     they will not be used unless some pattern's constraint asks for
     one.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_RENAME_OK (FROM, TO)
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is OK to rename a hard
     register FROM to another hard register TO.

     One common use of this macro is to prevent renaming of a register
     to another register that is not saved by a prologue in an interrupt
     handler.

     The default is always nonzero.

 -- Macro: MODES_TIEABLE_P (MODE1, MODE2)
     A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode MODE1 is
     accessible in mode MODE2 without copying.

     If 'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R, MODE1)' and 'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R,
     MODE2)' are always the same for any R, then 'MODES_TIEABLE_P
     (MODE1, MODE2)' should be nonzero.  If they differ for any R, you
     should define this macro to return zero unless some other mechanism
     ensures the accessibility of the value in a narrower mode.

     You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as
     possible since doing so will allow GCC to perform better register
     allocation.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HARD_REGNO_SCRATCH_OK (unsigned int REGNO)
     This target hook should return 'true' if it is OK to use a hard
     register REGNO as scratch reg in peephole2.

     One common use of this macro is to prevent using of a register that
     is not saved by a prologue in an interrupt handler.

     The default version of this hook always returns 'true'.

 -- Macro: AVOID_CCMODE_COPIES
     Define this macro if the compiler should avoid copies to/from
     'CCmode' registers.  You should only define this macro if support
     for copying to/from 'CCmode' is incomplete.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Leaf Functions,  Next: Stack Registers,  Prev: Values in Registers,  Up: Registers

17.7.4 Handling Leaf Functions
------------------------------

On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls) can
run more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.  Often
this means it is required to receive its arguments in the registers
where they are passed by the caller, instead of the registers where they
would normally arrive.

 The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special handling,
so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf functions".

 GCC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function is
suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.

 -- Macro: LEAF_REGISTERS
     Name of a char vector, indexed by hard register number, which
     contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate for leaf
     function treatment.

     If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers, then
     the registers marked here should be the ones before
     renumbering--those that GCC would ordinarily allocate.  The
     registers which will actually be used in the assembler code, after
     renumbering, should not be marked with 1 in this vector.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions.

 -- Macro: LEAF_REG_REMAP (REGNO)
     A C expression whose value is the register number to which REGNO
     should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf
     function.

     If REGNO is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
     function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1,
     which will cause the compiler to abort.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be
     renumbered to do this.

 'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and 'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must
usually treat leaf functions specially.  They can test the C variable
'current_function_is_leaf' which is nonzero for leaf functions.
'current_function_is_leaf' is set prior to local register allocation and
is valid for the remaining compiler passes.  They can also test the C
variable 'current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' which is nonzero for
leaf functions which only use leaf registers.
'current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' is valid after all passes that
modify the instructions have been run and is only useful if
'LEAF_REGISTERS' is defined.

17.7.5 Registers That Form a Stack
----------------------------------

There are special features to handle computers where some of the
"registers" form a stack.  Stack registers are normally written by
pushing onto the stack, and are numbered relative to the top of the
stack.

 Currently, GCC can only handle one group of stack-like registers, and
they must be consecutively numbered.  Furthermore, the existing support
for stack-like registers is specific to the 80387 floating point
coprocessor.  If you have a new architecture that uses stack-like
registers, you will need to do substantial work on 'reg-stack.c' and
write your machine description to cooperate with it, as well as defining
these macros.

 -- Macro: STACK_REGS
     Define this if the machine has any stack-like registers.

 -- Macro: STACK_REG_COVER_CLASS
     This is a cover class containing the stack registers.  Define this
     if the machine has any stack-like registers.

 -- Macro: FIRST_STACK_REG
     The number of the first stack-like register.  This one is the top
     of the stack.

 -- Macro: LAST_STACK_REG
     The number of the last stack-like register.  This one is the bottom
     of the stack.

17.8 Register Classes
=====================

On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.  For
example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These
machine restrictions are described to the compiler using "register
classes".

 You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and
saying which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify
register classes that are allowed as operands to particular instruction
patterns.

 In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact, one
class must be named 'ALL_REGS' and contain all the registers.  Another
class must be named 'NO_REGS' and contain no registers.  Often the union
of two classes will be another class; however, this is not required.

 One of the classes must be named 'GENERAL_REGS'.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters 'r'
and 'g' specify this class.  If 'GENERAL_REGS' is the same as
'ALL_REGS', just define it as a macro which expands to 'ALL_REGS'.

 Order the classes so that if class X is contained in class Y then X has
a lower class number than Y.

 The way classes other than 'GENERAL_REGS' are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

 You must define the narrowest register classes for allocatable
registers, so that each class either has no subclasses, or that for some
mode, the move cost between registers within the class is cheaper than
moving a register in the class to or from memory (*note Costs::).

 You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register for
a certain operand, you should define a class 'FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS'
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code, or
even internal compiler errors when reload cannot find a register in the
class computed via 'reg_class_subunion'.

 You must also specify certain redundant information about the register
classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which ones are
contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class contained
in their union.

 When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with 'HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.

 Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer
that mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the
operations for single-byte values ('QImode') are limited to certain
registers.  When this is so, each register class that is used in a
bitwise-and or shift instruction must have a subclass consisting of
registers from which single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This
is so that 'PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' can always have a possible value to
return.

 -- Data type: enum reg_class
     An enumerated type that must be defined with all the register class
     names as enumerated values.  'NO_REGS' must be first.  'ALL_REGS'
     must be the last register class, followed by one more enumerated
     value, 'LIM_REG_CLASSES', which is not a register class but rather
     tells how many classes there are.

     Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting the
     class name to type 'int'.  The number serves as an index in many of
     the tables described below.

 -- Macro: N_REG_CLASSES
     The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:

          #define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_NAMES
     An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C
     string constants.  These names are used in writing some of the
     debugging dumps.

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_CONTENTS
     An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as
     integers which are bit masks.  The Nth integer specifies the
     contents of class N.  The way the integer MASK is interpreted is
     that register R is in the class if 'MASK & (1 << R)' is 1.

     When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not
     suffice.  Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers,
     braced groupings containing several integers.  Each sub-initializer
     must be suitable as an initializer for the type 'HARD_REG_SET'
     which is defined in 'hard-reg-set.h'.  In this situation, the first
     integer in each sub-initializer corresponds to registers 0 through
     31, the second integer to registers 32 through 63, and so on.

 -- Macro: REGNO_REG_CLASS (REGNO)
     A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard
     register REGNO.  In general there is more than one such class;
     choose a class which is "minimal", meaning that no smaller class
     also contains the register.

 -- Macro: BASE_REG_CLASS
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an
     address which is the register value plus a displacement.

 -- Macro: MODE_BASE_REG_CLASS (MODE)
     This is a variation of the 'BASE_REG_CLASS' macro which allows the
     selection of a base register in a mode dependent manner.  If MODE
     is VOIDmode then it should return the same value as
     'BASE_REG_CLASS'.

 -- Macro: MODE_BASE_REG_REG_CLASS (MODE)
     A C expression whose value is the register class to which a valid
     base register must belong in order to be used in a base plus index
     register address.  You should define this macro if base plus index
     addresses have different requirements than other base register
     uses.

 -- Macro: MODE_CODE_BASE_REG_CLASS (MODE, ADDRESS_SPACE, OUTER_CODE,
          INDEX_CODE)
     A C expression whose value is the register class to which a valid
     base register for a memory reference in mode MODE to address space
     ADDRESS_SPACE must belong.  OUTER_CODE and INDEX_CODE define the
     context in which the base register occurs.  OUTER_CODE is the code
     of the immediately enclosing expression ('MEM' for the top level of
     an address, 'ADDRESS' for something that occurs in an
     'address_operand').  INDEX_CODE is the code of the corresponding
     index expression if OUTER_CODE is 'PLUS'; 'SCRATCH' otherwise.

 -- Macro: INDEX_REG_CLASS
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
     address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
     added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

 -- Macro: REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM)
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as a base register in operand addresses.

 -- Macro: REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM, MODE)
     A C expression that is just like 'REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
     instead of 'REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.  The mode may be 'VOIDmode' for
     addresses that appear outside a 'MEM', i.e., as an
     'address_operand'.

 -- Macro: REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_REG_BASE_P (NUM, MODE)
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as a base register in base plus index operand addresses,
     accessing memory in mode MODE.  It may be either a suitable hard
     register or a pseudo register that has been allocated such a hard
     register.  You should define this macro if base plus index
     addresses have different requirements than other base register
     uses.

     Use of this macro is deprecated; please use the more general
     'REGNO_MODE_CODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.

 -- Macro: REGNO_MODE_CODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM, MODE, ADDRESS_SPACE,
          OUTER_CODE, INDEX_CODE)
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as a base register in operand addresses, accessing memory
     in mode MODE in address space ADDRESS_SPACE.  This is similar to
     'REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that that expression may examine
     the context in which the register appears in the memory reference.
     OUTER_CODE is the code of the immediately enclosing expression
     ('MEM' if at the top level of the address, 'ADDRESS' for something
     that occurs in an 'address_operand').  INDEX_CODE is the code of
     the corresponding index expression if OUTER_CODE is 'PLUS';
     'SCRATCH' otherwise.  The mode may be 'VOIDmode' for addresses that
     appear outside a 'MEM', i.e., as an 'address_operand'.

 -- Macro: REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (NUM)
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
     either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

 -- Target Hook: reg_class_t TARGET_PREFERRED_RENAME_CLASS (reg_class_t
          RCLASS)
     A target hook that places additional preference on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to rename a register in class
     RCLASS to another class, or perhaps NO_REGS, if no preferred
     register class is found or hook 'preferred_rename_class' is not
     implemented.  Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes
     better code.  For example, on ARM, thumb-2 instructions using
     'LO_REGS' may be smaller than instructions using 'GENERIC_REGS'.
     By returning 'LO_REGS' from 'preferred_rename_class', code size can
     be reduced.

 -- Target Hook: reg_class_t TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (rtx X,
          reg_class_t RCLASS)
     A target hook that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to copy value X into a register
     in class RCLASS.  The value is a register class; perhaps RCLASS, or
     perhaps another, smaller class.

     The default version of this hook always returns value of 'rclass'
     argument.

     Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.
     For example, on the 68000, when X is an integer constant that is in
     range for a 'moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is always
     'DATA_REGS' as long as RCLASS includes the data registers.
     Requiring a data register guarantees that a 'moveq' will be used.

     One case where 'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' must not return
     RCLASS is if X is a legitimate constant which cannot be loaded into
     some register class.  By returning 'NO_REGS' you can force X into a
     memory location.  For example, rs6000 can load immediate values
     into general-purpose registers, but does not have an instruction
     for loading an immediate value into a floating-point register, so
     'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' returns 'NO_REGS' when X is a
     floating-point constant.  If the constant can't be loaded into any
     kind of register, code generation will be better if
     'TARGET_LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P' makes the constant illegitimate
     instead of using 'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS'.

     If an insn has pseudos in it after register allocation, reload will
     go through the alternatives and call repeatedly
     'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' to find the best one.  Returning
     'NO_REGS', in this case, makes reload add a '!' in front of the
     constraint: the x86 back-end uses this feature to discourage usage
     of 387 registers when math is done in the SSE registers (and vice
     versa).

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to copy value X into a register
     in class CLASS.  The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or
     perhaps another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following
     definition is safe:

          #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS

     Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.
     For example, on the 68000, when X is an integer constant that is in
     range for a 'moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is always
     'DATA_REGS' as long as CLASS includes the data registers.
     Requiring a data register guarantees that a 'moveq' will be used.

     One case where 'PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' must not return CLASS is if
     X is a legitimate constant which cannot be loaded into some
     register class.  By returning 'NO_REGS' you can force X into a
     memory location.  For example, rs6000 can load immediate values
     into general-purpose registers, but does not have an instruction
     for loading an immediate value into a floating-point register, so
     'PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' returns 'NO_REGS' when X is a
     floating-point constant.  If the constant can't be loaded into any
     kind of register, code generation will be better if
     'TARGET_LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P' makes the constant illegitimate
     instead of using 'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS'.

     If an insn has pseudos in it after register allocation, reload will
     go through the alternatives and call repeatedly
     'PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' to find the best one.  Returning
     'NO_REGS', in this case, makes reload add a '!' in front of the
     constraint: the x86 back-end uses this feature to discourage usage
     of 387 registers when math is done in the SSE registers (and vice
     versa).

 -- Target Hook: reg_class_t TARGET_PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (rtx
          X, reg_class_t RCLASS)
     Like 'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', but for output reloads
     instead of input reloads.

     The default version of this hook always returns value of 'rclass'
     argument.

     You can also use 'TARGET_PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to
     discourage reload from using some alternatives, like
     'TARGET_PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS'.

 -- Macro: LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (MODE, CLASS)
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of
     mode MODE in a reload register for which class CLASS would
     ordinarily be used.

     Unlike 'PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', this macro should be used when
     there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload
     classes.

     The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or perhaps another,
     smaller class.

     Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations
     which require the macro to do something nontrivial.

 -- Target Hook: reg_class_t TARGET_SECONDARY_RELOAD (bool IN_P, rtx X,
          reg_class_t RELOAD_CLASS, enum machine_mode RELOAD_MODE,
          secondary_reload_info *SRI)
     Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to
     or from memory or even from other types of registers.  An example
     is the 'MQ' register, which on most machines, can only be copied to
     or from general registers, but not memory.  Below, we shall be
     using the term 'intermediate register' when a move operation cannot
     be performed directly, but has to be done by copying the source
     into the intermediate register first, and then copying the
     intermediate register to the destination.  An intermediate register
     always has the same mode as source and destination.  Since it holds
     the actual value being copied, reload might apply optimizations to
     re-use an intermediate register and eliding the copy from the
     source when it can determine that the intermediate register still
     holds the required value.

     Another kind of secondary reload is required on some machines which
     allow copying all registers to and from memory, but require a
     scratch register for stores to some memory locations (e.g., those
     with symbolic address on the RT, and those with certain symbolic
     address on the SPARC when compiling PIC).  Scratch registers need
     not have the same mode as the value being copied, and usually hold
     a different value than that being copied.  Special patterns in the
     md file are needed to describe how the copy is performed with the
     help of the scratch register; these patterns also describe the
     number, register class(es) and mode(s) of the scratch register(s).

     In some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
     required.

     For input reloads, this target hook is called with nonzero IN_P,
     and X is an rtx that needs to be copied to a register of class
     RELOAD_CLASS in RELOAD_MODE.  For output reloads, this target hook
     is called with zero IN_P, and a register of class RELOAD_CLASS
     needs to be copied to rtx X in RELOAD_MODE.

     If copying a register of RELOAD_CLASS from/to X requires an
     intermediate register, the hook 'secondary_reload' should return
     the register class required for this intermediate register.  If no
     intermediate register is required, it should return NO_REGS. If
     more than one intermediate register is required, describe the one
     that is closest in the copy chain to the reload register.

     If scratch registers are needed, you also have to describe how to
     perform the copy from/to the reload register to/from this closest
     intermediate register.  Or if no intermediate register is required,
     but still a scratch register is needed, describe the copy from/to
     the reload register to/from the reload operand X.

     You do this by setting 'sri->icode' to the instruction code of a
     pattern in the md file which performs the move.  Operands 0 and 1
     are the output and input of this copy, respectively.  Operands from
     operand 2 onward are for scratch operands.  These scratch operands
     must have a mode, and a single-register-class output constraint.

     When an intermediate register is used, the 'secondary_reload' hook
     will be called again to determine how to copy the intermediate
     register to/from the reload operand X, so your hook must also have
     code to handle the register class of the intermediate operand.

     X might be a pseudo-register or a 'subreg' of a pseudo-register,
     which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
     'true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
     memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

     Scratch operands in memory (constraint '"=m"' / '"=&m"') are
     currently not supported.  For the time being, you will have to
     continue to use 'SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' for that purpose.

     'copy_cost' also uses this target hook to find out how values are
     copied.  If you want it to include some extra cost for the need to
     allocate (a) scratch register(s), set 'sri->extra_cost' to the
     additional cost.  Or if two dependent moves are supposed to have a
     lower cost than the sum of the individual moves due to expected
     fortuitous scheduling and/or special forwarding logic, you can set
     'sri->extra_cost' to a negative amount.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)
 -- Macro: SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)
 -- Macro: SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)
     These macros are obsolete, new ports should use the target hook
     'TARGET_SECONDARY_RELOAD' instead.

     These are obsolete macros, replaced by the
     'TARGET_SECONDARY_RELOAD' target hook.  Older ports still define
     these macros to indicate to the reload phase that it may need to
     allocate at least one register for a reload in addition to the
     register to contain the data.  Specifically, if copying X to a
     register CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate register, you were
     supposed to define 'SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to return the
     largest register class all of whose registers can be used as
     intermediate registers or scratch registers.

     If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate
     or scratch register, 'SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' was supposed
     to be defined be defined to return the largest register class
     required.  If the requirements for input and output reloads were
     the same, the macro 'SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should have been used
     instead of defining both macros identically.

     The values returned by these macros are often 'GENERAL_REGS'.
     Return 'NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be
     directly copied to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without
     requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this macro if it would
     always return 'NO_REGS'.

     If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
     intermediate register), you were supposed to define patterns for
     'reload_inM' or 'reload_outM', as required (*note Standard Names::.
     These patterns, which were normally implemented with a
     'define_expand', should be similar to the 'movM' patterns, except
     that operand 2 is the scratch register.

     These patterns need constraints for the reload register and scratch
     register that contain a single register class.  If the original
     reload register (whose class is CLASS) can meet the constraint
     given in the pattern, the value returned by these macros is used
     for the class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two additional
     reload registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from the
     constraints in the insn pattern.

     X might be a pseudo-register or a 'subreg' of a pseudo-register,
     which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
     'true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
     memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

     These macros should not be used in the case where a particular
     class of registers can only be copied to memory and not to another
     class of registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are
     not needed and would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location
     must be used to perform the copy and the 'movM' pattern should use
     memory as an intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between
     floating-point and general registers.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (CLASS1, CLASS2, M)
     Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be
     copied to some other registers without using memory.  Define this
     macro on those machines to be a C expression that is nonzero if
     objects of mode M in registers of CLASS1 can only be copied to
     registers of class CLASS2 by storing a register of CLASS1 into
     memory and loading that memory location into a register of CLASS2.

     Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (MODE)
     Normally when 'SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' is defined, the compiler
     allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register
     copies.  If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the
     memory location defined by this macro.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     'SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED'.

 -- Macro: SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (MODE)
     When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy between
     two registers of mode MODE, it normally allocates sufficient memory
     to hold a quantity of 'BITS_PER_WORD' bits and performs the store
     and load operations in a mode that many bits wide and whose class
     is the same as that of MODE.

     This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that
     all bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the
     registers in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for
     floating-point registers.

     However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines,
     such as the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point
     registers differently than in integer registers.  On those
     machines, the default widening will not work correctly and you must
     define this macro to suppress that widening in some cases.  See the
     file 'alpha.h' for details.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     'SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' or if widening MODE to a mode that is
     'BITS_PER_WORD' bits wide is correct for your machine.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (reg_class_t RCLASS)
     A target hook which returns 'true' if pseudos that have been
     assigned to registers of class RCLASS would likely be spilled
     because registers of RCLASS are needed for spill registers.

     The default version of this target hook returns 'true' if RCLASS
     has exactly one register and 'false' otherwise.  On most machines,
     this default should be used.  For generally register-starved
     machines, such as i386, or machines with right register
     constraints, such as SH, this hook can be used to avoid excessive
     spilling.

     This hook is also used by some of the global intra-procedural code
     transformations to throtle code motion, to avoid increasing
     register pressure.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned char TARGET_CLASS_MAX_NREGS (reg_class_t
          RCLASS, enum machine_mode MODE)
     A target hook returns the maximum number of consecutive registers
     of class RCLASS needed to hold a value of mode MODE.

     This is closely related to the macro 'HARD_REGNO_NREGS'.  In fact,
     the value returned by 'TARGET_CLASS_MAX_NREGS (RCLASS, MODE)'
     target hook should be the maximum value of 'HARD_REGNO_NREGS
     (REGNO, MODE)' for all REGNO values in the class RCLASS.

     This target hook helps control the handling of multiple-word values
     in the reload pass.

     The default version of this target hook returns the size of MODE in
     words.

 -- Macro: CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)
     A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers of
     class CLASS needed to hold a value of mode MODE.

     This is closely related to the macro 'HARD_REGNO_NREGS'.  In fact,
     the value of the macro 'CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)' should be
     the maximum value of 'HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)' for all REGNO
     values in the class CLASS.

     This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values in
     the reload pass.

 -- Macro: CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS (FROM, TO, CLASS)
     If defined, a C expression that returns nonzero for a CLASS for
     which a change from mode FROM to mode TO is invalid.

     For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects
     into floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64 bits.
     Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit
     object does not store the low-order 32 bits, as would be the case
     for a normal register.  Therefore, 'alpha.h' defines
     'CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' as below:

          #define CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS(FROM, TO, CLASS) \
            (GET_MODE_SIZE (FROM) != GET_MODE_SIZE (TO) \
             ? reg_classes_intersect_p (FLOAT_REGS, (CLASS)) : 0)

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_LRA_P (void)
     A target hook which returns true if we use LRA instead of reload
     pass.  It means that LRA was ported to the target.  The default
     version of this target hook returns always false.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_REGISTER_PRIORITY (int)
     A target hook which returns the register priority number to which
     the register HARD_REGNO belongs to.  The bigger the number, the
     more preferable the hard register usage (when all other conditions
     are the same).  This hook can be used to prefer some hard register
     over others in LRA. For example, some x86-64 register usage needs
     additional prefix which makes instructions longer.  The hook can
     return lower priority number for such registers make them less
     favorable and as result making the generated code smaller.  The
     default version of this target hook returns always zero.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_REGISTER_USAGE_LEVELING_P (void)
     A target hook which returns true if we need register usage
     leveling.  That means if a few hard registers are equally good for
     the assignment, we choose the least used hard register.  The
     register usage leveling may be profitable for some targets.  Don't
     use the usage leveling for targets with conditional execution or
     targets with big register files as it hurts if-conversion and
     cross-jumping optimizations.  The default version of this target
     hook returns always false.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_DIFFERENT_ADDR_DISPLACEMENT_P (void)
     A target hook which returns true if an address with the same
     structure can have different maximal legitimate displacement.  For
     example, the displacement can depend on memory mode or on operand
     combinations in the insn.  The default version of this target hook
     returns always false.

 -- Target Hook: reg_class_t TARGET_SPILL_CLASS (reg_class_t, enum
          MACHINE_MODE)
     This hook defines a class of registers which could be used for
     spilling pseudos of the given mode and class, or 'NO_REGS' if only
     memory should be used.  Not defining this hook is equivalent to
     returning 'NO_REGS' for all inputs.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_CSTORE_MODE (enum insn_code
          ICODE)
     This hook defines the machine mode to use for the boolean result of
     conditional store patterns.  The ICODE argument is the instruction
     code for the cstore being performed.  Not definiting this hook is
     the same as accepting the mode encoded into operand 0 of the cstore
     expander patterns.

17.9 Obsolete Macros for Defining Constraints
=============================================

Machine-specific constraints can be defined with these macros instead of
the machine description constructs described in *note Define
Constraints::.  This mechanism is obsolete.  New ports should not use
it; old ports should convert to the new mechanism.

 -- Macro: CONSTRAINT_LEN (CHAR, STR)
     For the constraint at the start of STR, which starts with the
     letter C, return the length.  This allows you to have register
     class / constant / extra constraints that are longer than a single
     letter; you don't need to define this macro if you can do with
     single-letter constraints only.  The definition of this macro
     should use DEFAULT_CONSTRAINT_LEN for all the characters that you
     don't want to handle specially.  There are some sanity checks in
     genoutput.c that check the constraint lengths for the md file, so
     you can also use this macro to help you while you are transitioning
     from a byzantine single-letter-constraint scheme: when you return a
     negative length for a constraint you want to re-use, genoutput will
     complain about every instance where it is used in the md file.

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (CHAR)
     A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters for register classes.  If CHAR is such a letter,
     the value should be the register class corresponding to it.
     Otherwise, the value should be 'NO_REGS'.  The register letter 'r',
     corresponding to class 'GENERAL_REGS', will not be passed to this
     macro; you do not need to handle it.

 -- Macro: REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT (CHAR, STR)
     Like 'REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER', but you also get the constraint
     string passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to distinguish
     between different variants.

 -- Macro: CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters ('I', 'J', 'K', ... 'P') that specify particular
     ranges of integer values.  If C is one of those letters, the
     expression should check that VALUE, an integer, is in the
     appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one
     of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

 -- Macro: CONST_OK_FOR_CONSTRAINT_P (VALUE, C, STR)
     Like 'CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P', but you also get the constraint
     string passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to distinguish
     between different variants.

 -- Macro: CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters that specify particular ranges of 'const_double'
     values ('G' or 'H').

     If C is one of those letters, the expression should check that
     VALUE, an RTX of code 'const_double', is in the appropriate range
     and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one of those letters,
     the value should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     'const_double' is used for all floating-point constants and for
     'DImode' fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
     or both kinds of values.  It can use 'GET_MODE' to distinguish
     between these kinds.

 -- Macro: CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_CONSTRAINT_P (VALUE, C, STR)
     Like 'CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P', but you also get the
     constraint string passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to
     distinguish between different variants.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (VALUE, C)
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters that can be used to segregate specific types of
     operands, usually memory references, for the target machine.  Any
     letter that is not elsewhere defined and not matched by
     'REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' / 'REG_CLASS_FROM_CONSTRAINT' may be used.
     Normally this macro will not be defined.

     If it is required for a particular target machine, it should return
     1 if VALUE corresponds to the operand type represented by the
     constraint letter C.  If C is not defined as an extra constraint,
     the value returned should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their
     output in r0 if the memory reference contains a symbolic address.
     Constraint letter 'Q' is defined as representing a memory address
     that does _not_ contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is
     specified with a 'Q' constraint on the input and 'r' on the output.
     The next alternative specifies 'm' on the input and a register
     class that does not include r0 on the output.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_CONSTRAINT_STR (VALUE, C, STR)
     Like 'EXTRA_CONSTRAINT', but you also get the constraint string
     passed in STR, so that you can use suffixes to distinguish between
     different variants.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_MEMORY_CONSTRAINT (C, STR)
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters, amongst those accepted by 'EXTRA_CONSTRAINT',
     that should be treated like memory constraints by the reload pass.

     It should return 1 if the operand type represented by the
     constraint at the start of STR, the first letter of which is the
     letter C, comprises a subset of all memory references including all
     those whose address is simply a base register.  This allows the
     reload pass to reload an operand, if it does not directly
     correspond to the operand type of C, by copying its address into a
     base register.

     For example, on the S/390, some instructions do not accept
     arbitrary memory references, but only those that do not make use of
     an index register.  The constraint letter 'Q' is defined via
     'EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' as representing a memory address of this type.
     If the letter 'Q' is marked as 'EXTRA_MEMORY_CONSTRAINT', a 'Q'
     constraint can handle any memory operand, because the reload pass
     knows it can be reloaded by copying the memory address into a base
     register if required.  This is analogous to the way an 'o'
     constraint can handle any memory operand.

 -- Macro: EXTRA_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINT (C, STR)
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters, amongst those accepted by 'EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' /
     'EXTRA_CONSTRAINT_STR', that should be treated like address
     constraints by the reload pass.

     It should return 1 if the operand type represented by the
     constraint at the start of STR, which starts with the letter C,
     comprises a subset of all memory addresses including all those that
     consist of just a base register.  This allows the reload pass to
     reload an operand, if it does not directly correspond to the
     operand type of STR, by copying it into a base register.

     Any constraint marked as 'EXTRA_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINT' can only be
     used with the 'address_operand' predicate.  It is treated
     analogously to the 'p' constraint.

17.10.1 Basic Stack Layout
--------------------------

Here is the basic stack layout.

 -- Macro: STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD
     Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
     pointer to a smaller address.

     When we say, "define this macro if ...", it means that the compiler
     checks this macro only with '#ifdef' so the precise definition used
     does not matter.

 -- Macro: STACK_PUSH_CODE
     This macro defines the operation used when something is pushed on
     the stack.  In RTL, a push operation will be '(set (mem
     (STACK_PUSH_CODE (reg sp))) ...)'

     The choices are 'PRE_DEC', 'POST_DEC', 'PRE_INC', and 'POST_INC'.
     Which of these is correct depends on the stack direction and on
     whether the stack pointer points to the last item on the stack or
     whether it points to the space for the next item on the stack.

     The default is 'PRE_DEC' when 'STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined,
     which is almost always right, and 'PRE_INC' otherwise, which is
     often wrong.

 -- Macro: FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD
     Define this macro to nonzero value if the addresses of local
     variable slots are at negative offsets from the frame pointer.

 -- Macro: ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD
     Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy
     decreasing addresses on the stack.

 -- Macro: STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET
     Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to
     be allocated.

     If 'FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD', find the next slot's offset by
     subtracting the first slot's length from 'STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
     Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to
     the value 'STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

 -- Macro: STACK_ALIGNMENT_NEEDED
     Define to zero to disable final alignment of the stack during
     reload.  The nonzero default for this macro is suitable for most
     ports.

     On ports where 'STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET' is nonzero or where there is
     a register save block following the local block that doesn't
     require alignment to 'STACK_BOUNDARY', it may be beneficial to
     disable stack alignment and do it in the backend.

 -- Macro: STACK_POINTER_OFFSET
     Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at
     which outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the default
     value of zero is used.  This is the proper value for most machines.

     If 'ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.

 -- Macro: FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
     address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
     function.

     If 'ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first argument's address.

 -- Macro: STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically
     allocated on the stack, e.g., by 'alloca'.

     The default value for this macro is 'STACK_POINTER_OFFSET' plus the
     length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
     machines.  See 'function.c' for details.

 -- Macro: INITIAL_FRAME_ADDRESS_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address of the
     initial stack frame.  This address is passed to 'RETURN_ADDR_RTX'
     and 'DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS'.  If you don't define this macro, a
     reasonable default value will be used.  Define this macro in order
     to make frame pointer elimination work in the presence of
     '__builtin_frame_address (count)' and '__builtin_return_address
     (count)' for 'count' not equal to zero.

 -- Macro: DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (FRAMEADDR)
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a
     stack frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.
     Assume that FRAMEADDR is an RTL expression for the address of the
     stack frame itself.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
     of FRAMEADDR--that is, the stack frame address is also the address
     of the stack word that points to the previous frame.

 -- Macro: SETUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES
     If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
     to setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For
     example, on the SPARC, we must flush all of the register windows to
     the stack before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  You will
     seldom need to define this macro.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_BUILTIN_SETJMP_FRAME_VALUE (void)
     This target hook should return an rtx that is used to store the
     address of the current frame into the built in 'setjmp' buffer.
     The default value, 'virtual_stack_vars_rtx', is correct for most
     machines.  One reason you may need to define this target hook is if
     'hard_frame_pointer_rtx' is the appropriate value on your machine.

 -- Macro: FRAME_ADDR_RTX (FRAMEADDR)
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the
     frame address for the current frame.  FRAMEADDR is the frame
     pointer of the current frame.  This is used for
     __builtin_frame_address.  You need only define this macro if the
     frame address is not the same as the frame pointer.  Most machines
     do not need to define it.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDR_RTX (COUNT, FRAMEADDR)
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the
     return address for the frame COUNT steps up from the current frame,
     after the prologue.  FRAMEADDR is the frame pointer of the COUNT
     frame, or the frame pointer of the COUNT - 1 frame if
     'RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME' is defined.

     The value of the expression must always be the correct address when
     COUNT is zero, but may be 'NULL_RTX' if there is no way to
     determine the return address of other frames.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME
     Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is
     accessed from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the location of the
     incoming return address at the beginning of any function, before
     the prologue.  This RTL is either a 'REG', indicating that the
     return value is saved in 'REG', or a 'MEM' representing a location
     in the stack.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

     If this RTL is a 'REG', you should also define
     'DWARF_FRAME_RETURN_COLUMN' to 'DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM (REGNO)'.

 -- Macro: DWARF_ALT_FRAME_RETURN_COLUMN
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving a DWARF 2 column
     number that may be used as an alternative return column.  The
     column must not correspond to any gcc hard register (that is, it
     must not be in the range of 'DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM').

     This macro can be useful if 'DWARF_FRAME_RETURN_COLUMN' is set to a
     general register, but an alternative column needs to be used for
     signal frames.  Some targets have also used different frame return
     columns over time.

 -- Macro: DWARF_ZERO_REG
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving a DWARF 2 register
     number that is considered to always have the value zero.  This
     should only be defined if the target has an architected zero
     register, and someone decided it was a good idea to use that
     register number to terminate the stack backtrace.  New ports should
     avoid this.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_DWARF_HANDLE_FRAME_UNSPEC (const char
          *LABEL, rtx PATTERN, int INDEX)
     This target hook allows the backend to emit frame-related insns
     that contain UNSPECs or UNSPEC_VOLATILEs.  The DWARF 2 call frame
     debugging info engine will invoke it on insns of the form
          (set (reg) (unspec [...] UNSPEC_INDEX))
     and
          (set (reg) (unspec_volatile [...] UNSPECV_INDEX)).
     to let the backend emit the call frame instructions.  LABEL is the
     CFI label attached to the insn, PATTERN is the pattern of the insn
     and INDEX is 'UNSPEC_INDEX' or 'UNSPECV_INDEX'.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
     bytes, from the value of the stack pointer register to the top of
     the stack frame at the beginning of any function, before the
     prologue.  The top of the frame is defined to be the value of the
     stack pointer in the previous frame, just before the call
     instruction.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
     bytes, from the argument pointer to the canonical frame address
     (cfa).  The final value should coincide with that calculated by
     'INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'.  Which is unfortunately not usable
     during virtual register instantiation.

     The default value for this macro is 'FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (fundecl) +
     crtl->args.pretend_args_size', which is correct for most machines;
     in general, the arguments are found immediately before the stack
     frame.  Note that this is not the case on some targets that save
     registers into the caller's frame, such as SPARC and rs6000, and so
     such targets need to define this macro.

     You only need to define this macro if the default is incorrect, and
     you want to support call frame debugging information like that
     provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: FRAME_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     If defined, a C expression whose value is an integer giving the
     offset in bytes from the frame pointer to the canonical frame
     address (cfa).  The final value should coincide with that
     calculated by 'INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'.

     Normally the CFA is calculated as an offset from the argument
     pointer, via 'ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET', but if the argument pointer
     is variable due to the ABI, this may not be possible.  If this
     macro is defined, it implies that the virtual register
     instantiation should be based on the frame pointer instead of the
     argument pointer.  Only one of 'FRAME_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET' and
     'ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET' should be defined.

 -- Macro: CFA_FRAME_BASE_OFFSET (FUNDECL)
     If defined, a C expression whose value is an integer giving the
     offset in bytes from the canonical frame address (cfa) to the frame
     base used in DWARF 2 debug information.  The default is zero.  A
     different value may reduce the size of debug information on some
     ports.

17.10.2 Exception Handling Support
----------------------------------

 -- Macro: EH_RETURN_DATA_REGNO (N)
     A C expression whose value is the Nth register number used for data
     by exception handlers, or 'INVALID_REGNUM' if fewer than N
     registers are usable.

     The exception handling library routines communicate with the
     exception handlers via a set of agreed upon registers.  Ideally
     these registers should be call-clobbered; it is possible to use
     call-saved registers, but may negatively impact code size.  The
     target must support at least 2 data registers, but should define 4
     if there are enough free registers.

     You must define this macro if you want to support call frame
     exception handling like that provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: EH_RETURN_STACKADJ_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing a location in which
     to store a stack adjustment to be applied before function return.
     This is used to unwind the stack to an exception handler's call
     frame.  It will be assigned zero on code paths that return
     normally.

     Typically this is a call-clobbered hard register that is otherwise
     untouched by the epilogue, but could also be a stack slot.

     Do not define this macro if the stack pointer is saved and restored
     by the regular prolog and epilog code in the call frame itself; in
     this case, the exception handling library routines will update the
     stack location to be restored in place.  Otherwise, you must define
     this macro if you want to support call frame exception handling
     like that provided by DWARF 2.

 -- Macro: EH_RETURN_HANDLER_RTX
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing a location in which
     to store the address of an exception handler to which we should
     return.  It will not be assigned on code paths that return
     normally.

     Typically this is the location in the call frame at which the
     normal return address is stored.  For targets that return by
     popping an address off the stack, this might be a memory address
     just below the _target_ call frame rather than inside the current
     call frame.  If defined, 'EH_RETURN_STACKADJ_RTX' will have already
     been assigned, so it may be used to calculate the location of the
     target call frame.

     Some targets have more complex requirements than storing to an
     address calculable during initial code generation.  In that case
     the 'eh_return' instruction pattern should be used instead.

     If you want to support call frame exception handling, you must
     define either this macro or the 'eh_return' instruction pattern.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDR_OFFSET
     If defined, an integer-valued C expression for which rtl will be
     generated to add it to the exception handler address before it is
     searched in the exception handling tables, and to subtract it again
     from the address before using it to return to the exception
     handler.

 -- Macro: ASM_PREFERRED_EH_DATA_FORMAT (CODE, GLOBAL)
     This macro chooses the encoding of pointers embedded in the
     exception handling sections.  If at all possible, this should be
     defined such that the exception handling section will not require
     dynamic relocations, and so may be read-only.

     CODE is 0 for data, 1 for code labels, 2 for function pointers.
     GLOBAL is true if the symbol may be affected by dynamic
     relocations.  The macro should return a combination of the
     'DW_EH_PE_*' defines as found in 'dwarf2.h'.

     If this macro is not defined, pointers will not be encoded but
     represented directly.

 -- Macro: ASM_MAYBE_OUTPUT_ENCODED_ADDR_RTX (FILE, ENCODING, SIZE,
          ADDR, DONE)
     This macro allows the target to emit whatever special magic is
     required to represent the encoding chosen by
     'ASM_PREFERRED_EH_DATA_FORMAT'.  Generic code takes care of
     pc-relative and indirect encodings; this must be defined if the
     target uses text-relative or data-relative encodings.

     This is a C statement that branches to DONE if the format was
     handled.  ENCODING is the format chosen, SIZE is the number of
     bytes that the format occupies, ADDR is the 'SYMBOL_REF' to be
     emitted.

 -- Macro: MD_FALLBACK_FRAME_STATE_FOR (CONTEXT, FS)
     This macro allows the target to add CPU and operating system
     specific code to the call-frame unwinder for use when there is no
     unwind data available.  The most common reason to implement this
     macro is to unwind through signal frames.

     This macro is called from 'uw_frame_state_for' in 'unwind-dw2.c',
     'unwind-dw2-xtensa.c' and 'unwind-ia64.c'.  CONTEXT is an
     '_Unwind_Context'; FS is an '_Unwind_FrameState'.  Examine
     'context->ra' for the address of the code being executed and
     'context->cfa' for the stack pointer value.  If the frame can be
     decoded, the register save addresses should be updated in FS and
     the macro should evaluate to '_URC_NO_REASON'.  If the frame cannot
     be decoded, the macro should evaluate to '_URC_END_OF_STACK'.

     For proper signal handling in Java this macro is accompanied by
     'MAKE_THROW_FRAME', defined in 'libjava/include/*-signal.h'
     headers.

 -- Macro: MD_HANDLE_UNWABI (CONTEXT, FS)
     This macro allows the target to add operating system specific code
     to the call-frame unwinder to handle the IA-64 '.unwabi' unwinding
     directive, usually used for signal or interrupt frames.

     This macro is called from 'uw_update_context' in libgcc's
     'unwind-ia64.c'.  CONTEXT is an '_Unwind_Context'; FS is an
     '_Unwind_FrameState'.  Examine 'fs->unwabi' for the abi and context
     in the '.unwabi' directive.  If the '.unwabi' directive can be
     handled, the register save addresses should be updated in FS.

 -- Macro: TARGET_USES_WEAK_UNWIND_INFO
     A C expression that evaluates to true if the target requires unwind
     info to be given comdat linkage.  Define it to be '1' if comdat
     linkage is necessary.  The default is '0'.

17.10.3 Specifying How Stack Checking is Done
---------------------------------------------

GCC will check that stack references are within the boundaries of the
stack, if the option '-fstack-check' is specified, in one of three ways:

  1. If the value of the 'STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' macro is nonzero, GCC
     will assume that you have arranged for full stack checking to be
     done at appropriate places in the configuration files.  GCC will
     not do other special processing.

  2. If 'STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' is zero and the value of the
     'STACK_CHECK_STATIC_BUILTIN' macro is nonzero, GCC will assume that
     you have arranged for static stack checking (checking of the static
     stack frame of functions) to be done at appropriate places in the
     configuration files.  GCC will only emit code to do dynamic stack
     checking (checking on dynamic stack allocations) using the third
     approach below.

  3. If neither of the above are true, GCC will generate code to
     periodically "probe" the stack pointer using the values of the
     macros defined below.

 If neither STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN nor STACK_CHECK_STATIC_BUILTIN is
defined, GCC will change its allocation strategy for large objects if
the option '-fstack-check' is specified: they will always be allocated
dynamically if their size exceeds 'STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE' bytes.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN
     A nonzero value if stack checking is done by the configuration
     files in a machine-dependent manner.  You should define this macro
     if stack checking is required by the ABI of your machine or if you
     would like to do stack checking in some more efficient way than the
     generic approach.  The default value of this macro is zero.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_STATIC_BUILTIN
     A nonzero value if static stack checking is done by the
     configuration files in a machine-dependent manner.  You should
     define this macro if you would like to do static stack checking in
     some more efficient way than the generic approach.  The default
     value of this macro is zero.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_PROBE_INTERVAL_EXP
     An integer specifying the interval at which GCC must generate stack
     probe instructions, defined as 2 raised to this integer.  You will
     normally define this macro so that the interval be no larger than
     the size of the "guard pages" at the end of a stack area.  The
     default value of 12 (4096-byte interval) is suitable for most
     systems.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_MOVING_SP
     An integer which is nonzero if GCC should move the stack pointer
     page by page when doing probes.  This can be necessary on systems
     where the stack pointer contains the bottom address of the memory
     area accessible to the executing thread at any point in time.  In
     this situation an alternate signal stack is required in order to be
     able to recover from a stack overflow.  The default value of this
     macro is zero.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_PROTECT
     The number of bytes of stack needed to recover from a stack
     overflow, for languages where such a recovery is supported.  The
     default value of 75 words with the 'setjmp'/'longjmp'-based
     exception handling mechanism and 8192 bytes with other exception
     handling mechanisms should be adequate for most machines.

 The following macros are relevant only if neither STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN
nor STACK_CHECK_STATIC_BUILTIN is defined; you can omit them altogether
in the opposite case.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE
     The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes.  GCC will generate
     probe instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this
     many bytes of stack are available.  If a stack frame is larger than
     this size, stack checking will not be reliable and GCC will issue a
     warning.  The default is chosen so that GCC only generates one
     instruction on most systems.  You should normally not change the
     default value of this macro.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE
     GCC uses this value to generate the above warning message.  It
     represents the amount of fixed frame used by a function, not
     including space for any callee-saved registers, temporaries and
     user variables.  You need only specify an upper bound for this
     amount and will normally use the default of four words.

 -- Macro: STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE
     The maximum size, in bytes, of an object that GCC will place in the
     fixed area of the stack frame when the user specifies
     '-fstack-check'.  GCC computed the default from the values of the
     above macros and you will normally not need to override that
     default.

17.10.4 Registers That Address the Stack Frame
----------------------------------------------

This discusses registers that address the stack frame.

 -- Macro: STACK_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also
     be a fixed register according to 'FIXED_REGISTERS'.  On most
     machines, the hardware determines which register this is.

 -- Macro: FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to
     access automatic variables in the stack frame.  On some machines,
     the hardware determines which register this is.  On other machines,
     you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.

 -- Macro: HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM
     On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
     offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
     allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers
     are between these two locations).  On those machines, define
     'FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' the number of a special, fixed register to
     be used internally until the offset is known, and define
     'HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' to be the actual hard register number
     used for the frame pointer.

     You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances
     when it is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame
     pointer and the automatic variables until after register allocation
     has been completed.  When this macro is defined, you must also
     indicate in your definition of 'ELIMINABLE_REGS' how to eliminate
     'FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' into either 'HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' or
     'STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'.

     Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
     'FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'.

 -- Macro: ARG_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to
     access the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is the
     same as the frame pointer register.  On some machines, the hardware
     determines which register this is.  On other machines, you can
     choose any register you wish for this purpose.  If this is not the
     same register as the frame pointer register, then you must mark it
     as a fixed register according to 'FIXED_REGISTERS', or arrange to
     be able to eliminate it (*note Elimination::).

 -- Macro: HARD_FRAME_POINTER_IS_FRAME_POINTER
     Define this to a preprocessor constant that is nonzero if
     'hard_frame_pointer_rtx' and 'frame_pointer_rtx' should be the
     same.  The default definition is '(HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM ==
     FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM)'; you only need to define this macro if that
     definition is not suitable for use in preprocessor conditionals.

 -- Macro: HARD_FRAME_POINTER_IS_ARG_POINTER
     Define this to a preprocessor constant that is nonzero if
     'hard_frame_pointer_rtx' and 'arg_pointer_rtx' should be the same.
     The default definition is '(HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM ==
     ARG_POINTER_REGNUM)'; you only need to define this macro if that
     definition is not suitable for use in preprocessor conditionals.

 -- Macro: RETURN_ADDRESS_POINTER_REGNUM
     The register number of the return address pointer register, which
     is used to access the current function's return address from the
     stack.  On some machines, the return address is not at a fixed
     offset from the frame pointer or stack pointer or argument pointer.
     This register can be defined to point to the return address on the
     stack, and then be converted by 'ELIMINABLE_REGS' into either the
     frame pointer or stack pointer.

     Do not define this macro unless there is no other way to get the
     return address from the stack.

 -- Macro: STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM
 -- Macro: STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM
     Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain
     pointer.  If register windows are used, the register number as seen
     by the called function is 'STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM', while the
     register number as seen by the calling function is
     'STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'.  If these registers are the same,
     'STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM' need not be defined.

     The static chain register need not be a fixed register.

     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros should not be
     defined; instead, the 'TARGET_STATIC_CHAIN' hook should be used.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_STATIC_CHAIN (const_tree FNDECL, bool
          INCOMING_P)
     This hook replaces the use of 'STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM' et al for
     targets that may use different static chain locations for different
     nested functions.  This may be required if the target has function
     attributes that affect the calling conventions of the function and
     those calling conventions use different static chain locations.

     The default version of this hook uses 'STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM' et al.

     If the static chain is passed in memory, this hook should be used
     to provide rtx giving 'mem' expressions that denote where they are
     stored.  Often the 'mem' expression as seen by the caller will be
     at an offset from the stack pointer and the 'mem' expression as
     seen by the callee will be at an offset from the frame pointer.
     The variables 'stack_pointer_rtx', 'frame_pointer_rtx', and
     'arg_pointer_rtx' will have been initialized and should be used to
     refer to those items.

 -- Macro: DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS
     This macro specifies the maximum number of hard registers that can
     be saved in a call frame.  This is used to size data structures
     used in DWARF2 exception handling.

     Prior to GCC 3.0, this macro was needed in order to establish a
     stable exception handling ABI in the face of adding new hard
     registers for ISA extensions.  In GCC 3.0 and later, the EH ABI is
     insulated from changes in the number of hard registers.
     Nevertheless, this macro can still be used to reduce the runtime
     memory requirements of the exception handling routines, which can
     be substantial if the ISA contains a lot of registers that are not
     call-saved.

     If this macro is not defined, it defaults to
     'FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.

 -- Macro: PRE_GCC3_DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS

     This macro is similar to 'DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS', but is provided
     for backward compatibility in pre GCC 3.0 compiled code.

     If this macro is not defined, it defaults to
     'DWARF_FRAME_REGISTERS'.

 -- Macro: DWARF_REG_TO_UNWIND_COLUMN (REGNO)

     Define this macro if the target's representation for dwarf
     registers is different than the internal representation for unwind
     column.  Given a dwarf register, this macro should return the
     internal unwind column number to use instead.

     See the PowerPC's SPE target for an example.

 -- Macro: DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM (REGNO)

     Define this macro if the target's representation for dwarf
     registers used in .eh_frame or .debug_frame is different from that
     used in other debug info sections.  Given a GCC hard register
     number, this macro should return the .eh_frame register number.
     The default is 'DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)'.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_FRAME_REG_OUT (REGNO, FOR_EH)

     Define this macro to map register numbers held in the call frame
     info that GCC has collected using 'DWARF_FRAME_REGNUM' to those
     that should be output in .debug_frame ('FOR_EH' is zero) and
     .eh_frame ('FOR_EH' is nonzero).  The default is to return 'REGNO'.

 -- Macro: REG_VALUE_IN_UNWIND_CONTEXT

     Define this macro if the target stores register values as
     '_Unwind_Word' type in unwind context.  It should be defined if
     target register size is larger than the size of 'void *'.  The
     default is to store register values as 'void *' type.

 -- Macro: ASSUME_EXTENDED_UNWIND_CONTEXT

     Define this macro to be 1 if the target always uses extended unwind
     context with version, args_size and by_value fields.  If it is
     undefined, it will be defined to 1 when
     'REG_VALUE_IN_UNWIND_CONTEXT' is defined and 0 otherwise.

17.10.5 Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer
-------------------------------------------------

This is about eliminating the frame pointer and arg pointer.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED (void)
     This target hook should return 'true' if a function must have and
     use a frame pointer.  This target hook is called in the reload
     pass.  If its return value is 'true' the function will have a frame
     pointer.

     This target hook can in principle examine the current function and
     decide according to the facts, but on most machines the constant
     'false' or the constant 'true' suffices.  Use 'false' when the
     machine allows code to be generated with no frame pointer, and
     doing so saves some time or space.  Use 'true' when there is no
     possible advantage to avoiding a frame pointer.

     In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid
     code without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases
     and automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of
     what 'TARGET_FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' returns.  You don't need to
     worry about them.

     In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame
     pointer register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you
     mark it as a fixed register.  See 'FIXED_REGISTERS' for more
     information.

     Default return value is 'false'.

 -- Macro: INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (DEPTH-VAR)
     A C statement to store in the variable DEPTH-VAR the difference
     between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately
     after the function prologue.  The value would be computed from
     information such as the result of 'get_frame_size ()' and the
     tables of registers 'regs_ever_live' and 'call_used_regs'.

     If 'ELIMINABLE_REGS' is defined, this macro will be not be used and
     need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
     'TARGET_FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' always returns true; in that case,
     you may set DEPTH-VAR to anything.

 -- Macro: ELIMINABLE_REGS
     If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
     eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If
     it is not defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler
     is to replace references to the frame pointer with references to
     the stack pointer.

     The definition of this macro is a list of structure
     initializations, each of which specifies an original and
     replacement register.

     On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not known
     until the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a separate
     hard register must be used for the argument pointer.  This register
     can be eliminated by replacing it with either the frame pointer or
     the argument pointer, depending on whether or not the frame pointer
     has been eliminated.

     In this case, you might specify:
          #define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
          {{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}

     Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack
     pointer is specified first since that is the preferred elimination.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CAN_ELIMINATE (const int FROM_REG, const
          int TO_REG)
     This target hook should returns 'true' if the compiler is allowed
     to try to replace register number FROM_REG with register number
     TO_REG.  This target hook need only be defined if 'ELIMINABLE_REGS'
     is defined, and will usually be 'true', since most of the cases
     preventing register elimination are things that the compiler
     already knows about.

     Default return value is 'true'.

 -- Macro: INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (FROM-REG, TO-REG, OFFSET-VAR)
     This macro is similar to 'INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET'.  It
     specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
     registers.  This macro must be defined if 'ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined.

17.10.6 Passing Function Arguments on the Stack
-----------------------------------------------

The macros in this section control how arguments are passed on the
stack.  See the following section for other macros that control passing
certain arguments in registers.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES (const_tree FNTYPE)
     This target hook returns 'true' if an argument declared in a
     prototype as an integral type smaller than 'int' should actually be
     passed as an 'int'.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain
     cases of mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain
     machines.  The default is to not promote prototypes.

 -- Macro: PUSH_ARGS
     A C expression.  If nonzero, push insns will be used to pass
     outgoing arguments.  If the target machine does not have a push
     instruction, set it to zero.  That directs GCC to use an alternate
     strategy: to allocate the entire argument block and then store the
     arguments into it.  When 'PUSH_ARGS' is nonzero, 'PUSH_ROUNDING'
     must be defined too.

 -- Macro: PUSH_ARGS_REVERSED
     A C expression.  If nonzero, function arguments will be evaluated
     from last to first, rather than from first to last.  If this macro
     is not defined, it defaults to 'PUSH_ARGS' on targets where the
     stack and args grow in opposite directions, and 0 otherwise.

 -- Macro: PUSH_ROUNDING (NPUSHED)
     A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
     stack when an instruction attempts to push NPUSHED bytes.

     On some machines, the definition

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)

     will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear to
     push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
     alignment.  Then the definition should be

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) & ~1)

     If the value of this macro has a type, it should be an unsigned
     type.

 -- Macro: ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS
     A C expression.  If nonzero, the maximum amount of space required
     for outgoing arguments will be computed and placed into
     'crtl->outgoing_args_size'.  No space will be pushed onto the stack
     for each call; instead, the function prologue should increase the
     stack frame size by this amount.

     Setting both 'PUSH_ARGS' and 'ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is not
     proper.

 -- Macro: REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNDECL)
     Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has
     been allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
     registers.

     The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area reserved
     for arguments passed in registers for the function represented by
     FNDECL, which can be zero if GCC is calling a library function.
     The argument FNDECL can be the FUNCTION_DECL, or the type itself of
     the function.

     This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
     machine-dependent stack frame: 'OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' says
     which.

 -- Macro: INCOMING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNDECL)
     Like 'REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE', but for incoming register arguments.
     Define this macro if space guaranteed when compiling a function
     body is different to space required when making a call, a situation
     that can arise with K&R style function definitions.

 -- Macro: OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNTYPE)
     Define this to a nonzero value if it is the responsibility of the
     caller to allocate the area reserved for arguments passed in
     registers when calling a function of FNTYPE.  FNTYPE may be NULL if
     the function called is a library function.

     If 'ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, this macro controls
     whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
     'crtl->outgoing_args_size'.

 -- Macro: STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA
     Define this macro if 'REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is defined, but the
     stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.

     Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is placed
     on the stack beyond the 'REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' area.  Defining this
     macro suppresses this behavior and causes the parameter to be
     passed on the stack in its natural location.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_RETURN_POPS_ARGS (tree FUNDECL, tree
          FUNTYPE, int SIZE)
     This target hook returns the number of bytes of its own arguments
     that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function pops no
     arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all after the
     function returns.

     FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     'FUNCTION_DECL' that describes the declaration of the function.
     From this you can obtain the 'DECL_ATTRIBUTES' of the function.

     FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     'FUNCTION_TYPE' that describes the data type of the function.  From
     this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
     arguments (if known).

     When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNDECL will
     contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if you
     need to distinguish among various library functions, you can do so
     by their names.  Note that "library function" in this context means
     a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
     specially in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
     compiled.

     SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the stack.  If a
     variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and argument
     popping will always be the responsibility of the calling function.

     On the VAX, all functions always pop their arguments, so the
     definition of this macro is SIZE.  On the 68000, using the standard
     calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so the value
     of the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an alternative calling
     convention is available in which functions that take a fixed number
     of arguments pop them but other functions (such as 'printf') pop
     nothing (the caller pops all).  When this convention is in use,
     FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a function takes a fixed
     number of arguments.

 -- Macro: CALL_POPS_ARGS (CUM)
     A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes a call
     sequence pops off the stack.  It is added to the value of
     'RETURN_POPS_ARGS' when compiling a function call.

     CUM is the variable in which all arguments to the called function
     have been accumulated.

     On certain architectures, such as the SH5, a call trampoline is
     used that pops certain registers off the stack, depending on the
     arguments that have been passed to the function.  Since this is a
     property of the call site, not of the called function,
     'RETURN_POPS_ARGS' is not appropriate.

17.10.7 Passing Arguments in Registers
--------------------------------------

This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG (cumulative_args_t CA, enum
          machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE, bool NAMED)
     Return an RTX indicating whether a function argument is passed in a
     register and if so, which register.

     The arguments are CA, which summarizes all the previous arguments;
     MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data type of the
     argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known (which happens
     for C support library functions); and NAMED, which is 'true' for an
     ordinary argument and 'false' for nameless arguments that
     correspond to '...' in the called function's prototype.  TYPE can
     be an incomplete type if a syntax error has previously occurred.

     The return value is usually either a 'reg' RTX for the hard
     register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
     argument on the stack.

     The value of the expression can also be a 'parallel' RTX.  This is
     used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode of
     the 'parallel' should be the mode of the entire argument.  The
     'parallel' holds any number of 'expr_list' pairs; each one
     describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
     'expr_list' the first operand must be a 'reg' RTX for the hard
     register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode
     of the register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument
     is.  The second operand of the 'expr_list' is a 'const_int' which
     gives the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this
     part starts.  As a special exception the first 'expr_list' in the
     'parallel' RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates
     that the entire argument is also stored on the stack.

     The last time this hook is called, it is called with 'MODE ==
     VOIDmode', and its result is passed to the 'call' or 'call_value'
     pattern as operands 2 and 3 respectively.

     The usual way to make the ISO library 'stdarg.h' work on a machine
     where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
     nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
     by making 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 'false'.

     You may use the hook 'targetm.calls.must_pass_in_stack' in the
     definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a type
     that must be passed in the stack.  If 'REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is not
     defined and 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' returns nonzero for such an
     argument, the compiler will abort.  If 'REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is
     defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then loaded
     into a register.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (enum machine_mode MODE,
          const_tree TYPE)
     This target hook should return 'true' if we should not pass TYPE
     solely in registers.  The file 'expr.h' defines a definition that
     is usually appropriate, refer to 'expr.h' for additional
     documentation.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (cumulative_args_t CA,
          enum machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE, bool NAMED)
     Define this hook if the target machine has "register windows", so
     that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
     necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
     argument.

     For such machines, 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' computes the register in
     which the caller passes the value, and
     'TARGET_FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' should be defined in a similar
     fashion to tell the function being called where the arguments will
     arrive.

     If 'TARGET_FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' is not defined,
     'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' serves both purposes.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ARG_PARTIAL_BYTES (cumulative_args_t CUM,
          enum machine_mode MODE, tree TYPE, bool NAMED)
     This target hook returns the number of bytes at the beginning of an
     argument that must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
     arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are
     entirely pushed on the stack.

     On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
     registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically
     the first few words of arguments are passed in registers, and the
     rest on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a 'double' or a
     structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be
     passed in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells
     the compiler when this occurs, and how many bytes should go in
     registers.

     'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' for these arguments should return the first
     register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
     'TARGET_FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG', for the called function.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (cumulative_args_t CUM,
          enum machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE, bool NAMED)
     This target hook should return 'true' if an argument at the
     position indicated by CUM should be passed by reference.  This
     predicate is queried after target independent reasons for being
     passed by reference, such as 'TREE_ADDRESSABLE (type)'.

     If the hook returns true, a copy of that argument is made in memory
     and a pointer to the argument is passed instead of the argument
     itself.  The pointer is passed in whatever way is appropriate for
     passing a pointer to that type.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CALLEE_COPIES (cumulative_args_t CUM, enum
          machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE, bool NAMED)
     The function argument described by the parameters to this hook is
     known to be passed by reference.  The hook should return true if
     the function argument should be copied by the callee instead of
     copied by the caller.

     For any argument for which the hook returns true, if it can be
     determined that the argument is not modified, then a copy need not
     be generated.

     The default version of this hook always returns false.

 -- Macro: CUMULATIVE_ARGS
     A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first
     argument of 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' and other related values.  For
     some target machines, the type 'int' suffices and can hold the
     number of bytes of argument so far.

     There is no need to record in 'CUMULATIVE_ARGS' anything about the
     arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has
     other variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on
     which all arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to
     store anything in 'CUMULATIVE_ARGS'; however, the data structure
     must exist and should not be empty, so use 'int'.

 -- Macro: OVERRIDE_ABI_FORMAT (FNDECL)
     If defined, this macro is called before generating any code for a
     function, but after the CFUN descriptor for the function has been
     created.  The back end may use this macro to update CFUN to reflect
     an ABI other than that which would normally be used by default.  If
     the compiler is generating code for a compiler-generated function,
     FNDECL may be 'NULL'.

 -- Macro: INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME, FNDECL,
          N_NAMED_ARGS)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable CUM
     for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable
     has type 'CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.  The value of FNTYPE is the tree node
     for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
     if the args are to a compiler support library function.  For direct
     calls that are not libcalls, FNDECL contain the declaration node of
     the function.  FNDECL is also set when 'INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is
     used to find arguments for the function being compiled.
     N_NAMED_ARGS is set to the number of named arguments, including a
     structure return address if it is passed as a parameter, when
     making a call.  When processing incoming arguments, N_NAMED_ARGS is
     set to -1.

     When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
     LIBNAME identifies which one.  It is a 'symbol_ref' rtx which
     contains the name of the function, as a string.  LIBNAME is 0 when
     an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time
     this macro is called, either LIBNAME or FNTYPE is nonzero, but
     never both of them at once.

 -- Macro: INIT_CUMULATIVE_LIBCALL_ARGS (CUM, MODE, LIBNAME)
     Like 'INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but only used for outgoing libcalls, it
     gets a 'MODE' argument instead of FNTYPE, that would be 'NULL'.
     INDIRECT would always be zero, too.  If this macro is not defined,
     'INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (cum, NULL_RTX, libname, 0)' is used instead.

 -- Macro: INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME)
     Like 'INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but overrides it for the purposes of
     finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this
     macro is undefined, 'INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used instead.

     The value passed for LIBNAME is always 0, since library routines
     with special calling conventions are never compiled with GCC.  The
     argument LIBNAME exists for symmetry with 'INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (cumulative_args_t CA,
          enum machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE, bool NAMED)
     This hook updates the summarizer variable pointed to by CA to
     advance past an argument in the argument list.  The values MODE,
     TYPE and NAMED describe that argument.  Once this is done, the
     variable CUM is suitable for analyzing the _following_ argument
     with 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG', etc.

     This hook need not do anything if the argument in question was
     passed on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount of
     stack space used for arguments without any special help.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_OFFSET (MODE, TYPE)
     If defined, a C expression that is the number of bytes to add to
     the offset of the argument passed in memory.  This is needed for
     the SPU, which passes 'char' and 'short' arguments in the preferred
     slot that is in the middle of the quad word instead of starting at
     the top.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE)
     If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which
     direction, to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value
     should be of type 'enum direction': either 'upward' to pad above
     the argument, 'downward' to pad below, or 'none' to inhibit
     padding.

     The _amount_ of padding is not controlled by this macro, but by the
     target hook 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG_ROUND_BOUNDARY'.  It is always
     just enough to reach the next multiple of that boundary.

     This macro has a default definition which is right for most
     systems.  For little-endian machines, the default is to pad upward.
     For big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward for an
     argument of constant size shorter than an 'int', and upward
     otherwise.

 -- Macro: PAD_VARARGS_DOWN
     If defined, a C expression which determines whether the default
     implementation of va_arg will attempt to pad down before reading
     the next argument, if that argument is smaller than its aligned
     space as controlled by 'PARM_BOUNDARY'.  If this macro is not
     defined, all such arguments are padded down if 'BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'
     is true.

 -- Macro: BLOCK_REG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE, FIRST)
     Specify padding for the last element of a block move between
     registers and memory.  FIRST is nonzero if this is the only
     element.  Defining this macro allows better control of register
     function parameters on big-endian machines, without using
     'PARALLEL' rtl.  In particular, 'MUST_PASS_IN_STACK' need not test
     padding and mode of types in registers, as there is no longer a
     "wrong" part of a register; For example, a three byte aggregate may
     be passed in the high part of a register if so required.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (enum
          machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE)
     This hook returns the alignment boundary, in bits, of an argument
     with the specified mode and type.  The default hook returns
     'PARM_BOUNDARY' for all arguments.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG_ROUND_BOUNDARY (enum
          machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE)
     Normally, the size of an argument is rounded up to 'PARM_BOUNDARY',
     which is the default value for this hook.  You can define this hook
     to return a different value if an argument size must be rounded to
     a larger value.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (REGNO)
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This
     does _not_ include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
     the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
     used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on
     the stack.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SPLIT_COMPLEX_ARG (const_tree TYPE)
     This hook should return true if parameter of type TYPE are passed
     as two scalar parameters.  By default, GCC will attempt to pack
     complex arguments into the target's word size.  Some ABIs require
     complex arguments to be split and treated as their individual
     components.  For example, on AIX64, complex floats should be passed
     in a pair of floating point registers, even though a complex float
     would fit in one 64-bit floating point register.

     The default value of this hook is 'NULL', which is treated as
     always false.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_BUILD_BUILTIN_VA_LIST (void)
     This hook returns a type node for 'va_list' for the target.  The
     default version of the hook returns 'void*'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ENUM_VA_LIST_P (int IDX, const char **PNAME,
          tree *PTREE)
     This target hook is used in function 'c_common_nodes_and_builtins'
     to iterate through the target specific builtin types for va_list.
     The variable IDX is used as iterator.  PNAME has to be a pointer to
     a 'const char *' and PTREE a pointer to a 'tree' typed variable.
     The arguments PNAME and PTREE are used to store the result of this
     macro and are set to the name of the va_list builtin type and its
     internal type.  If the return value of this macro is zero, then
     there is no more element.  Otherwise the IDX should be increased
     for the next call of this macro to iterate through all types.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_FN_ABI_VA_LIST (tree FNDECL)
     This hook returns the va_list type of the calling convention
     specified by FNDECL.  The default version of this hook returns
     'va_list_type_node'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_CANONICAL_VA_LIST_TYPE (tree TYPE)
     This hook returns the va_list type of the calling convention
     specified by the type of TYPE.  If TYPE is not a valid va_list
     type, it returns 'NULL_TREE'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_GIMPLIFY_VA_ARG_EXPR (tree VALIST, tree
          TYPE, gimple_seq *PRE_P, gimple_seq *POST_P)
     This hook performs target-specific gimplification of 'VA_ARG_EXPR'.
     The first two parameters correspond to the arguments to 'va_arg';
     the latter two are as in 'gimplify.c:gimplify_expr'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VALID_POINTER_MODE (enum machine_mode MODE)
     Define this to return nonzero if the port can handle pointers with
     machine mode MODE.  The default version of this hook returns true
     for both 'ptr_mode' and 'Pmode'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_REF_MAY_ALIAS_ERRNO (struct ao_ref *REF)
     Define this to return nonzero if the memory reference REF may alias
     with the system C library errno location.  The default version of
     this hook assumes the system C library errno location is either a
     declaration of type int or accessed by dereferencing a pointer to
     int.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCALAR_MODE_SUPPORTED_P (enum machine_mode
          MODE)
     Define this to return nonzero if the port is prepared to handle
     insns involving scalar mode MODE.  For a scalar mode to be
     considered supported, all the basic arithmetic and comparisons must
     work.

     The default version of this hook returns true for any mode required
     to handle the basic C types (as defined by the port).  Included
     here are the double-word arithmetic supported by the code in
     'optabs.c'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VECTOR_MODE_SUPPORTED_P (enum machine_mode
          MODE)
     Define this to return nonzero if the port is prepared to handle
     insns involving vector mode MODE.  At the very least, it must have
     move patterns for this mode.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ARRAY_MODE_SUPPORTED_P (enum machine_mode
          MODE, unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT NELEMS)
     Return true if GCC should try to use a scalar mode to store an
     array of NELEMS elements, given that each element has mode MODE.
     Returning true here overrides the usual 'MAX_FIXED_MODE' limit and
     allows GCC to use any defined integer mode.

     One use of this hook is to support vector load and store operations
     that operate on several homogeneous vectors.  For example, ARM NEON
     has operations like:

          int8x8x3_t vld3_s8 (const int8_t *)

     where the return type is defined as:

          typedef struct int8x8x3_t
          {
            int8x8_t val[3];
          } int8x8x3_t;

     If this hook allows 'val' to have a scalar mode, then 'int8x8x3_t'
     can have the same mode.  GCC can then store 'int8x8x3_t's in
     registers rather than forcing them onto the stack.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES_FOR_MODE_P (enum
          machine_mode MODE)
     Define this to return nonzero for machine modes for which the port
     has small register classes.  If this target hook returns nonzero
     for a given MODE, the compiler will try to minimize the lifetime of
     registers in MODE.  The hook may be called with 'VOIDmode' as
     argument.  In this case, the hook is expected to return nonzero if
     it returns nonzero for any mode.

     On some machines, it is risky to let hard registers live across
     arbitrary insns.  Typically, these machines have instructions that
     require values to be in specific registers (like an accumulator),
     and reload will fail if the required hard register is used for
     another purpose across such an insn.

     Passes before reload do not know which hard registers will be used
     in an instruction, but the machine modes of the registers set or
     used in the instruction are already known.  And for some machines,
     register classes are small for, say, integer registers but not for
     floating point registers.  For example, the AMD x86-64 architecture
     requires specific registers for the legacy x86 integer
     instructions, but there are many SSE registers for floating point
     operations.  On such targets, a good strategy may be to return
     nonzero from this hook for 'INTEGRAL_MODE_P' machine modes but zero
     for the SSE register classes.

     The default version of this hook returns false for any mode.  It is
     always safe to redefine this hook to return with a nonzero value.
     But if you unnecessarily define it, you will reduce the amount of
     optimizations that can be performed in some cases.  If you do not
     define this hook to return a nonzero value when it is required, the
     compiler will run out of spill registers and print a fatal error
     message.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_FLAGS_REGNUM
     If the target has a dedicated flags register, and it needs to use
     the post-reload comparison elimination pass, then this value should
     be set appropriately.

17.10.8 How Scalar Function Values Are Returned
-----------------------------------------------

This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
values--values that can fit in registers.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE (const_tree RET_TYPE,
          const_tree FN_DECL_OR_TYPE, bool OUTGOING)

     Define this to return an RTX representing the place where a
     function returns or receives a value of data type RET_TYPE, a tree
     node representing a data type.  FN_DECL_OR_TYPE is a tree node
     representing 'FUNCTION_DECL' or 'FUNCTION_TYPE' of a function being
     called.  If OUTGOING is false, the hook should compute the register
     in which the caller will see the return value.  Otherwise, the hook
     should return an RTX representing the place where a function
     returns a value.

     On many machines, only 'TYPE_MODE (RET_TYPE)' is relevant.
     (Actually, on most machines, scalar values are returned in the same
     place regardless of mode.)  The value of the expression is usually
     a 'reg' RTX for the hard register where the return value is stored.
     The value can also be a 'parallel' RTX, if the return value is in
     multiple places.  See 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG' for an explanation of
     the 'parallel' form.  Note that the callee will populate every
     location specified in the 'parallel', but if the first element of
     the 'parallel' contains the whole return value, callers will use
     that element as the canonical location and ignore the others.  The
     m68k port uses this type of 'parallel' to return pointers in both
     '%a0' (the canonical location) and '%d0'.

     If 'TARGET_PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN' returns true, you must apply
     the same promotion rules specified in 'PROMOTE_MODE' if VALTYPE is
     a scalar type.

     If the precise function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     ('FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention for
     specific functions when all their calls are known.

     Some target machines have "register windows" so that the register
     in which a function returns its value is not the same as the one in
     which the caller sees the value.  For such machines, you should
     return different RTX depending on OUTGOING.

     'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE' is not used for return values with
     aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.
     See 'TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' and related macros, below.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)
     This macro has been deprecated.  Use 'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE' for a
     new target instead.

 -- Macro: LIBCALL_VALUE (MODE)
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     library function returns a value of mode MODE.

     Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
     support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
     specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
     compiled.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_LIBCALL_VALUE (enum machine_mode MODE,
          const_rtx FUN)
     Define this hook if the back-end needs to know the name of the
     libcall function in order to determine where the result should be
     returned.

     The mode of the result is given by MODE and the name of the called
     library function is given by FUN.  The hook should return an RTX
     representing the place where the library function result will be
     returned.

     If this hook is not defined, then LIBCALL_VALUE will be used.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (REGNO)
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which the values of called function may come back.

     A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as
     the second of a pair (for a value of type 'double', say) need not
     be recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
     suffices:

          #define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)

     If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the
     called function use different registers for the return value, this
     macro should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

     This macro has been deprecated.  Use
     'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' for a new target instead.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (const unsigned int
          REGNO)
     A target hook that return 'true' if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which the values of called function may come back.

     A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as
     the second of a pair (for a value of type 'double', say) need not
     be recognized by this target hook.

     If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the
     called function use different registers for the return value, this
     target hook should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

     If this hook is not defined, then FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P will be
     used.

 -- Macro: APPLY_RESULT_SIZE
     Define this macro if 'untyped_call' and 'untyped_return' need more
     space than is implied by 'FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' for saving and
     restoring an arbitrary return value.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RETURN_IN_MSB (const_tree TYPE)
     This hook should return true if values of type TYPE are returned at
     the most significant end of a register (in other words, if they are
     padded at the least significant end).  You can assume that TYPE is
     returned in a register; the caller is required to check this.

     Note that the register provided by 'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE' must be
     able to hold the complete return value.  For example, if a 1-, 2-
     or 3-byte structure is returned at the most significant end of a
     4-byte register, 'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE' should provide an 'SImode'
     rtx.

17.10.9 How Large Values Are Returned
-------------------------------------

When a function value's mode is 'BLKmode' (and in some other cases), the
value is not returned according to 'TARGET_FUNCTION_VALUE' (*note Scalar
Return::).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a block of memory
in which the value should be stored.  This address is called the
"structure value address".

 This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RETURN_IN_MEMORY (const_tree TYPE,
          const_tree FNTYPE)
     This target hook should return a nonzero value to say to return the
     function value in memory, just as large structures are always
     returned.  Here TYPE will be the data type of the value, and FNTYPE
     will be the type of the function doing the returning, or 'NULL' for
     libcalls.

     Note that values of mode 'BLKmode' must be explicitly handled by
     this function.  Also, the option '-fpcc-struct-return' takes effect
     regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is possible to leave
     the hook undefined; this causes a default definition to be used,
     whose value is the constant 1 for 'BLKmode' values, and 0
     otherwise.

     Do not use this hook to indicate that structures and unions should
     always be returned in memory.  You should instead use
     'DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN' to indicate this.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN
     Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values
     must be in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should
     be defined only if needed for compatibility with other compilers or
     with an ABI.  If you define this macro to be 0, then the
     conventions used for structure and union return values are decided
     by the 'TARGET_RETURN_IN_MEMORY' target hook.

     If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX (tree FNDECL, int INCOMING)
     This target hook should return the location of the structure value
     address (normally a 'mem' or 'reg'), or 0 if the address is passed
     as an "invisible" first argument.  Note that FNDECL may be 'NULL',
     for libcalls.  You do not need to define this target hook if the
     address is always passed as an "invisible" first argument.

     On some architectures the place where the structure value address
     is found by the called function is not the same place that the
     caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could be
     because the function prologue moves it to a different place.
     INCOMING is '1' or '2' when the location is needed in the context
     of the called function, and '0' in the context of the caller.

     If INCOMING is nonzero and the address is to be found on the stack,
     return a 'mem' which refers to the frame pointer.  If INCOMING is
     '2', the result is being used to fetch the structure value address
     at the beginning of a function.  If you need to emit adjusting
     code, you should do it at this point.

 -- Macro: PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN
     Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target
     machine for returning structures and unions is for the called
     function to return the address of a static variable containing the
     value.

     Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the caller
     to pass an address to the subroutine.

     This macro has effect in '-fpcc-struct-return' mode, but it does
     nothing when you use '-freg-struct-return' mode.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_GET_RAW_RESULT_MODE (int
          REGNO)
     This target hook returns the mode to be used when accessing raw
     return registers in '__builtin_return'.  Define this macro if the
     value in REG_RAW_MODE is not correct.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_GET_RAW_ARG_MODE (int REGNO)
     This target hook returns the mode to be used when accessing raw
     argument registers in '__builtin_apply_args'.  Define this macro if
     the value in REG_RAW_MODE is not correct.

17.10.10 Caller-Saves Register Allocation
-----------------------------------------

If you enable it, GCC can save registers around function calls.  This
makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold variables that
must live across calls.

 -- Macro: CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (REFS, CALLS)
     A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider
     placing a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and
     saving and restoring it around each function call.  The expression
     should be 1 when this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

     If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on
     most machines: '4 * CALLS < REFS'.

 -- Macro: HARD_REGNO_CALLER_SAVE_MODE (REGNO, NREGS)
     A C expression specifying which mode is required for saving NREGS
     of a pseudo-register in call-clobbered hard register REGNO.  If
     REGNO is unsuitable for caller save, 'VOIDmode' should be returned.
     For most machines this macro need not be defined since GCC will
     select the smallest suitable mode.

17.10.11 Function Entry and Exit
--------------------------------

This section describes the macros that output function entry
("prologue") and exit ("epilogue") code.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (FILE *FILE,
          HOST_WIDE_INT SIZE)
     If defined, a function that outputs the assembler code for entry to
     a function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the stack
     frame, initializing the frame pointer register, saving registers
     that must be saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes of storage
     for the local variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is a stdio
     stream to which the assembler code should be output.

     The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by
     this macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

     To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the
     array 'regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is
     used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
     prologue should save register R, provided it is not one of the
     call-used registers.  ('TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must likewise
     use 'regs_ever_live'.)

     On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code
     does not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows,
     even if they are supposed to be preserved by function calls;
     instead it takes appropriate steps to "push" the register stack, if
     any non-call-used registers are used in the function.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
     pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether
     a frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     'frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 at run time
     in a function that needs a frame pointer.  *Note Elimination::.

     The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack
     space required for the function.  This stack space consists of the
     regions listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated
     in the order listed, with the last listed region closest to the top
     of the stack (the lowest address if 'STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is
     defined, and the highest address if it is not defined).  You can
     use a different order for a machine if doing so is more convenient
     or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
     required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the
     stack layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other
     compilers for a machine.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_END_PROLOGUE (FILE *FILE)
     If defined, a function that outputs assembler code at the end of a
     prologue.  This should be used when the function prologue is being
     emitted as RTL, and you have some extra assembler that needs to be
     emitted.  *Note prologue instruction pattern::.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_BEGIN_EPILOGUE (FILE *FILE)
     If defined, a function that outputs assembler code at the start of
     an epilogue.  This should be used when the function epilogue is
     being emitted as RTL, and you have some extra assembler that needs
     to be emitted.  *Note epilogue instruction pattern::.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (FILE *FILE,
          HOST_WIDE_INT SIZE)
     If defined, a function that outputs the assembler code for exit
     from a function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the
     saved registers and stack pointer to their values when the function
     was called, and returning control to the caller.  This macro takes
     the same arguments as the macro 'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE', and
     the registers to restore are determined from 'regs_ever_live' and
     'CALL_USED_REGISTERS' in the same way.

     On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the
     work of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
     instruction the name 'return' and do not define the macro
     'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' at all.

     Do not define a pattern named 'return' if you want the
     'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to be used.  If you want the target
     switches to control whether return instructions or epilogues are
     used, define a 'return' pattern with a validity condition that
     tests the target switches appropriately.  If the 'return' pattern's
     validity condition is false, epilogues will be used.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for
     these two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a
     frame pointer is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     'frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 when
     compiling a function that needs a frame pointer.

     Normally, 'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and
     'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat leaf functions specially.
     The C variable 'current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a
     function.  *Note Leaf Functions::.

     On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
     others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020
     when given '-mrtd' pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
     number of arguments.

     Your definition of the macro 'RETURN_POPS_ARGS' decides which
     functions pop their own arguments.  'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
     needs to know what was decided.  The number of bytes of the current
     function's arguments that this function should pop is available in
     'crtl->args.pops_args'.  *Note Scalar Return::.

   * A region of 'crtl->args.pretend_args_size' bytes of uninitialized
     space just underneath the first argument arriving on the stack.
     (This may not be at the very start of the allocated stack region if
     the calling sequence has pushed anything else since pushing the
     stack arguments.  But usually, on such machines, nothing else has
     been pushed yet, because the function prologue itself does all the
     pushing.)  This region is used on machines where an argument may be
     passed partly in registers and partly in memory, and, in some cases
     to support the features in '<stdarg.h>'.

   * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
     function.  The size of this area, which may also include space for
     such things as the return address and pointers to previous stack
     frames, is machine-specific and usually depends on which registers
     have been used in the function.  Machines with register windows
     often do not require a save area.

   * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
     allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
     function.  On some machines, this region and the save area may
     occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to the top
     of the stack.

   * Optionally, when 'ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a region of
     'crtl->outgoing_args_size' bytes to be used for outgoing argument
     lists of the function.  *Note Stack Arguments::.

 -- Macro: EXIT_IGNORE_STACK
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
     instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
     pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
     adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.  The
     default is 0.

     Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for
     which frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a
     final stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer, and
     the compiler knows this regardless of 'EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'.

 -- Macro: EPILOGUE_USES (REGNO)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers
     that are used by the epilogue or the 'return' pattern.  The stack
     and frame pointer registers are already assumed to be used as
     needed.

 -- Macro: EH_USES (REGNO)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers
     that are used by the exception handling mechanism, and so should be
     considered live on entry to an exception edge.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (FILE *FILE, tree
          THUNK_FNDECL, HOST_WIDE_INT DELTA, HOST_WIDE_INT VCALL_OFFSET,
          tree FUNCTION)
     A function that outputs the assembler code for a thunk function,
     used to implement C++ virtual function calls with multiple
     inheritance.  The thunk acts as a wrapper around a virtual
     function, adjusting the implicit object parameter before handing
     control off to the real function.

     First, emit code to add the integer DELTA to the location that
     contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument
     contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the 'this' pointer
     in C++.  This is the incoming argument _before_ the function
     prologue, e.g. '%o0' on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the
     values of all other incoming arguments.

     Then, if VCALL_OFFSET is nonzero, an additional adjustment should
     be made after adding 'delta'.  In particular, if P is the adjusted
     pointer, the following adjustment should be made:

          p += (*((ptrdiff_t **)p))[vcall_offset/sizeof(ptrdiff_t)]

     After the additions, emit code to jump to FUNCTION, which is a
     'FUNCTION_DECL'.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does
     not touch the return address.  Hence returning from FUNCTION will
     return to whoever called the current 'thunk'.

     The effect must be as if FUNCTION had been called directly with the
     adjusted first argument.  This macro is responsible for emitting
     all of the code for a thunk function;
     'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and 'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
     are not invoked.

     The THUNK_FNDECL is redundant.  (DELTA and FUNCTION have already
     been extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on some
     targets, but probably not.

     If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in the
     C++ front end will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk that
     calls FUNCTION instead of jumping to it.  The generic approach does
     not support varargs.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_CAN_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (const_tree
          THUNK_FNDECL, HOST_WIDE_INT DELTA, HOST_WIDE_INT VCALL_OFFSET,
          const_tree FUNCTION)
     A function that returns true if TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK would be
     able to output the assembler code for the thunk function specified
     by the arguments it is passed, and false otherwise.  In the latter
     case, the generic approach will be used by the C++ front end, with
     the limitations previously exposed.

17.10.12 Generating Code for Profiling
--------------------------------------

These macros will help you generate code for profiling.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to call the profiling subroutine 'mcount'.

     The details of how 'mcount' expects to be called are determined by
     your operating system environment, not by GCC.  To figure them out,
     compile a small program for profiling using the system's installed
     C compiler and look at the assembler code that results.

     Older implementations of 'mcount' expect the address of a counter
     variable to be loaded into some register.  The name of this
     variable is 'LP' followed by the number LABELNO, so you would
     generate the name using 'LP%d' in a 'fprintf'.

 -- Macro: PROFILE_HOOK
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some assembly
     code to call the profiling subroutine 'mcount' even the target does
     not support profiling.

 -- Macro: NO_PROFILE_COUNTERS
     Define this macro to be an expression with a nonzero value if the
     'mcount' subroutine on your system does not need a counter variable
     allocated for each function.  This is true for almost all modern
     implementations.  If you define this macro, you must not use the
     LABELNO argument to 'FUNCTION_PROFILER'.

 -- Macro: PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE
     Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come
     before the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes
     after.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Tail Calls,  Next: Stack Smashing Protection,  Prev: Profiling,  Up: Stack and Calling

17.10.13 Permitting tail calls
------------------------------

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FUNCTION_OK_FOR_SIBCALL (tree DECL, tree
          EXP)
     True if it is OK to do sibling call optimization for the specified
     call expression EXP.  DECL will be the called function, or 'NULL'
     if this is an indirect call.

     It is not uncommon for limitations of calling conventions to
     prevent tail calls to functions outside the current unit of
     translation, or during PIC compilation.  The hook is used to
     enforce these restrictions, as the 'sibcall' md pattern can not
     fail, or fall over to a "normal" call.  The criteria for successful
     sibling call optimization may vary greatly between different
     architectures.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_EXTRA_LIVE_ON_ENTRY (bitmap REGS)
     Add any hard registers to REGS that are live on entry to the
     function.  This hook only needs to be defined to provide registers
     that cannot be found by examination of FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P, the
     callee saved registers, STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM,
     STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM, TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM,
     EH_USES, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, and the
     PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SET_UP_BY_PROLOGUE (struct
          hard_reg_set_container *)
     This hook should add additional registers that are computed by the
     prologue to the hard regset for shrink-wrapping optimization
     purposes.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_WARN_FUNC_RETURN (tree)
     True if a function's return statements should be checked for
     matching the function's return type.  This includes checking for
     falling off the end of a non-void function.  Return false if no
     such check should be made.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Stack Smashing Protection,  Prev: Tail Calls,  Up: Stack and Calling

17.10.14 Stack smashing protection
----------------------------------

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_STACK_PROTECT_GUARD (void)
     This hook returns a 'DECL' node for the external variable to use
     for the stack protection guard.  This variable is initialized by
     the runtime to some random value and is used to initialize the
     guard value that is placed at the top of the local stack frame.
     The type of this variable must be 'ptr_type_node'.

     The default version of this hook creates a variable called
     '__stack_chk_guard', which is normally defined in 'libgcc2.c'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_STACK_PROTECT_FAIL (void)
     This hook returns a 'CALL_EXPR' that alerts the runtime that the
     stack protect guard variable has been modified.  This expression
     should involve a call to a 'noreturn' function.

     The default version of this hook invokes a function called
     '__stack_chk_fail', taking no arguments.  This function is normally
     defined in 'libgcc2.c'.

 -- Common Target Hook: bool TARGET_SUPPORTS_SPLIT_STACK (bool REPORT,
          struct gcc_options *OPTS)
     Whether this target supports splitting the stack when the options
     described in OPTS have been passed.  This is called after options
     have been parsed, so the target may reject splitting the stack in
     some configurations.  The default version of this hook returns
     false.  If REPORT is true, this function may issue a warning or
     error; if REPORT is false, it must simply return a value


File: gccint.info,  Node: Varargs,  Next: Trampolines,  Prev: Stack and Calling,  Up: Target Macros

17.11 Implementing the Varargs Macros
=====================================

GCC comes with an implementation of '<varargs.h>' and '<stdarg.h>' that
work without change on machines that pass arguments on the stack.  Other
machines require their own implementations of varargs, and the two
machine independent header files must have conditionals to include it.

 ISO '<stdarg.h>' differs from traditional '<varargs.h>' mainly in the
calling convention for 'va_start'.  The traditional implementation takes
just one argument, which is the variable in which to store the argument
pointer.  The ISO implementation of 'va_start' takes an additional
second argument.  The user is supposed to write the last named argument
of the function here.

 However, 'va_start' should not use this argument.  The way to find the
end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.

 -- Macro: __builtin_saveregs ()
     Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in memory
     so that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ISO and
     traditional versions of 'va_start' must use '__builtin_saveregs',
     unless you use 'TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' (see below) instead.

     On some machines, '__builtin_saveregs' is open-coded under the
     control of the target hook 'TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  On
     other machines, it calls a routine written in assembler language,
     found in 'libgcc2.c'.

     Code generated for the call to '__builtin_saveregs' appears at the
     beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
     '__builtin_saveregs' is written, regardless of what the code is.
     This is because the registers must be saved before the function
     starts to use them for its own purposes.

 -- Macro: __builtin_next_arg (LASTARG)
     This builtin returns the address of the first anonymous stack
     argument, as type 'void *'.  If 'ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', it returns
     the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
     argument.  Use it in 'va_start' to initialize the pointer for
     fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in 'va_start' to
     verify that the second parameter LASTARG is the last named argument
     of the current function.

 -- Macro: __builtin_classify_type (OBJECT)
     Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
     passed in which kind of register, your implementation of 'va_arg'
     has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
     specified data type is to use '__builtin_classify_type' together
     with 'sizeof' and '__alignof__'.

     '__builtin_classify_type' ignores the value of OBJECT, considering
     only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what kind of
     type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.

     The file 'typeclass.h' defines an enumeration that you can use to
     interpret the values of '__builtin_classify_type'.

 These machine description macros help implement varargs:

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (void)
     If defined, this hook produces the machine-specific code for a call
     to '__builtin_saveregs'.  This code will be moved to the very
     beginning of the function, before any parameter access are made.
     The return value of this function should be an RTX that contains
     the value to use as the return of '__builtin_saveregs'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (cumulative_args_t
          ARGS_SO_FAR, enum machine_mode MODE, tree TYPE, int
          *PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE, int SECOND_TIME)
     This target hook offers an alternative to using
     '__builtin_saveregs' and defining the hook
     'TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  Use it to store the anonymous
     register arguments into the stack so that all the arguments appear
     to have been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is done,
     you can use the standard implementation of varargs that works for
     machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.

     The argument ARGS_SO_FAR points to the 'CUMULATIVE_ARGS' data
     structure, containing the values that are obtained after processing
     the named arguments.  The arguments MODE and TYPE describe the last
     named argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.

     The target hook should do two things: first, push onto the stack
     all the argument registers _not_ used for the named arguments, and
     second, store the size of the data thus pushed into the
     'int'-valued variable pointed to by PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE.  The value
     that you store here will serve as additional offset for setting up
     the stack frame.

     Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
     compile time without knowing their data types,
     'TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is only useful on machines that
     have just a single category of argument register and use it
     uniformly for all data types.

     If the argument SECOND_TIME is nonzero, it means that the arguments
     of the function are being analyzed for the second time.  This
     happens for an inline function, which is not actually compiled
     until the end of the source file.  The hook
     'TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' should not generate any
     instructions in this case.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING (cumulative_args_t
          CA)
     Define this hook to return 'true' if the location where a function
     argument is passed depends on whether or not it is a named
     argument.

     This hook controls how the NAMED argument to 'TARGET_FUNCTION_ARG'
     is set for varargs and stdarg functions.  If this hook returns
     'true', the NAMED argument is always true for named arguments, and
     false for unnamed arguments.  If it returns 'false', but
     'TARGET_PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED' returns 'true', then all
     arguments are treated as named.  Otherwise, all named arguments
     except the last are treated as named.

     You need not define this hook if it always returns 'false'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED
          (cumulative_args_t CA)
     If you need to conditionally change ABIs so that one works with
     'TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS', but the other works like neither
     'TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' nor 'TARGET_STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING'
     was defined, then define this hook to return 'true' if
     'TARGET_SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is used, 'false' otherwise.
     Otherwise, you should not define this hook.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Trampolines,  Next: Library Calls,  Prev: Varargs,  Up: Target Macros

17.12 Trampolines for Nested Functions
======================================

A "trampoline" is a small piece of code that is created at run time when
the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on the
stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros tell
GCC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a trampoline.

 The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a constant
address into the static chain register, and jump to the real address of
the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k, this requires
two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the two addresses
exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.  On RISC
machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a register in
two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate immediate
operands.

 The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the variable
parts--the static chain value and the function address--into the
immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (FILE *F)
     This hook is called by 'assemble_trampoline_template' to output, on
     the stream F, assembler code for a block of data that contains the
     constant parts of a trampoline.  This code should not include a
     label--the label is taken care of automatically.

     If you do not define this hook, it means no template is needed for
     the target.  Do not define this hook on systems where the block
     move code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger than
     the code to generate it on the spot.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_SECTION
     Return the section into which the trampoline template is to be
     placed (*note Sections::).  The default value is
     'readonly_data_section'.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_SIZE
     A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an
     integer.

 -- Macro: TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT
     Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

     If you don't define this macro, the value of 'FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT'
     is used for aligning trampolines.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_TRAMPOLINE_INIT (rtx M_TRAMP, tree FNDECL,
          rtx STATIC_CHAIN)
     This hook is called to initialize a trampoline.  M_TRAMP is an RTX
     for the memory block for the trampoline; FNDECL is the
     'FUNCTION_DECL' for the nested function; STATIC_CHAIN is an RTX for
     the static chain value that should be passed to the function when
     it is called.

     If the target defines 'TARGET_ASM_TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE', then the
     first thing this hook should do is emit a block move into M_TRAMP
     from the memory block returned by 'assemble_trampoline_template'.
     Note that the block move need only cover the constant parts of the
     trampoline.  If the target isolates the variable parts of the
     trampoline to the end, not all 'TRAMPOLINE_SIZE' bytes need be
     copied.

     If the target requires any other actions, such as flushing caches
     or enabling stack execution, these actions should be performed
     after initializing the trampoline proper.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_TRAMPOLINE_ADJUST_ADDRESS (rtx ADDR)
     This hook should perform any machine-specific adjustment in the
     address of the trampoline.  Its argument contains the address of
     the memory block that was passed to 'TARGET_TRAMPOLINE_INIT'.  In
     case the address to be used for a function call should be different
     from the address at which the template was stored, the different
     address should be returned; otherwise ADDR should be returned
     unchanged.  If this hook is not defined, ADDR will be used for
     function calls.

 Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they
have separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack
location fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when the
program jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

 Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts of
the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is to
make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

 To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized, define
the following macro.

 -- Macro: CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (BEG, END)
     If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the _instruction
     cache_ in the specified interval.  The definition of this macro
     would typically be a series of 'asm' statements.  Both BEG and END
     are both pointer expressions.

 To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In addition,
you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill an entire
cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that the
beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same point in
its cache line.  Look in 'm68k.h' as a guide.

 -- Macro: TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE
     Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do
     their work.  The macro should expand to a series of 'asm'
     statements which will be compiled with GCC.  They go in a library
     function named '__transfer_from_trampoline'.

     If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a
     compiled C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so
     by placing a special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use
     one 'asm' statement to generate an assembler label, and another to
     make the label global.  Then trampolines can use that label to jump
     directly to your special assembler code.

17.13 Implicit Calls to Library Routines
========================================

Here is an explanation of implicit calls to library routines.

 -- Macro: DECLARE_LIBRARY_RENAMES
     This macro, if defined, should expand to a piece of C code that
     will get expanded when compiling functions for libgcc.a.  It can be
     used to provide alternate names for GCC's internal library
     functions if there are ABI-mandated names that the compiler should
     provide.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INIT_LIBFUNCS (void)
     This hook should declare additional library routines or rename
     existing ones, using the functions 'set_optab_libfunc' and
     'init_one_libfunc' defined in 'optabs.c'.  'init_optabs' calls this
     macro after initializing all the normal library routines.

     The default is to do nothing.  Most ports don't need to define this
     hook.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_LIBFUNC_GNU_PREFIX
     If false (the default), internal library routines start with two
     underscores.  If set to true, these routines start with '__gnu_'
     instead.  E.g., '__muldi3' changes to '__gnu_muldi3'.  This
     currently only affects functions defined in 'libgcc2.c'.  If this
     is set to true, the 'tm.h' file must also '#define
     LIBGCC2_GNU_PREFIX'.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_LIB_COMPARE_RETURNS_BOOL (MODE, COMPARISON)
     This macro should return 'true' if the library routine that
     implements the floating point comparison operator COMPARISON in
     mode MODE will return a boolean, and FALSE if it will return a
     tristate.

     GCC's own floating point libraries return tristates from the
     comparison operators, so the default returns false always.  Most
     ports don't need to define this macro.

 -- Macro: TARGET_LIB_INT_CMP_BIASED
     This macro should evaluate to 'true' if the integer comparison
     functions (like '__cmpdi2') return 0 to indicate that the first
     operand is smaller than the second, 1 to indicate that they are
     equal, and 2 to indicate that the first operand is greater than the
     second.  If this macro evaluates to 'false' the comparison
     functions return -1, 0, and 1 instead of 0, 1, and 2.  If the
     target uses the routines in 'libgcc.a', you do not need to define
     this macro.

 -- Macro: TARGET_HAS_NO_HW_DIVIDE
     This macro should be defined if the target has no hardware divide
     instructions.  If this macro is defined, GCC will use an algorithm
     which make use of simple logical and arithmetic operations for
     64-bit division.  If the macro is not defined, GCC will use an
     algorithm which make use of a 64-bit by 32-bit divide primitive.

 -- Macro: TARGET_EDOM
     The value of 'EDOM' on the target machine, as a C integer constant
     expression.  If you don't define this macro, GCC does not attempt
     to deposit the value of 'EDOM' into 'errno' directly.  Look in
     '/usr/include/errno.h' to find the value of 'EDOM' on your system.

     If you do not define 'TARGET_EDOM', then compiled code reports
     domain errors by calling the library function and letting it report
     the error.  If mathematical functions on your system use 'matherr'
     when there is an error, then you should leave 'TARGET_EDOM'
     undefined so that 'matherr' is used normally.

 -- Macro: GEN_ERRNO_RTX
     Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression
     that refers to the global "variable" 'errno'.  (On certain systems,
     'errno' may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
     macro, a reasonable default is used.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_LIBC_HAS_FUNCTION (enum function_class
          FN_CLASS)
     This hook determines whether a function from a class of functions
     FN_CLASS is present at the runtime.

 -- Macro: NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME
     Set this macro to 1 to use the "NeXT" Objective-C message sending
     conventions by default.  This calling convention involves passing
     the object, the selector and the method arguments all at once to
     the method-lookup library function.  This is the usual setting when
     targeting Darwin/Mac OS X systems, which have the NeXT runtime
     installed.

     If the macro is set to 0, the "GNU" Objective-C message sending
     convention will be used by default.  This convention passes just
     the object and the selector to the method-lookup function, which
     returns a pointer to the method.

     In either case, it remains possible to select code-generation for
     the alternate scheme, by means of compiler command line switches.

17.14 Addressing Modes
======================

This is about addressing modes.

 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT
 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_INCREMENT
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_DECREMENT
     A C expression that is nonzero if the machine supports
     pre-increment, pre-decrement, post-increment, or post-decrement
     addressing respectively.

 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_MODIFY_DISP
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_MODIFY_DISP
     A C expression that is nonzero if the machine supports pre- or
     post-address side-effect generation involving constants other than
     the size of the memory operand.

 -- Macro: HAVE_PRE_MODIFY_REG
 -- Macro: HAVE_POST_MODIFY_REG
     A C expression that is nonzero if the machine supports pre- or
     post-address side-effect generation involving a register
     displacement.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (X)
     A C expression that is 1 if the RTX X is a constant which is a
     valid address.  On most machines the default definition of
     '(CONSTANT_P (X) && GET_CODE (X) != CONST_DOUBLE)' is acceptable,
     but a few machines are more restrictive as to which constant
     addresses are supported.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_P (X)
     'CONSTANT_P', which is defined by target-independent code, accepts
     integer-values expressions whose values are not explicitly known,
     such as 'symbol_ref', 'label_ref', and 'high' expressions and
     'const' arithmetic expressions, in addition to 'const_int' and
     'const_double' expressions.

 -- Macro: MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS
     A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a
     valid memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a value
     equal to the maximum number that 'TARGET_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P'
     would ever accept.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P (enum machine_mode
          MODE, rtx X, bool STRICT)
     A function that returns whether X (an RTX) is a legitimate memory
     address on the target machine for a memory operand of mode MODE.

     Legitimate addresses are defined in two variants: a strict variant
     and a non-strict one.  The STRICT parameter chooses which variant
     is desired by the caller.

     The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It must be defined
     so that any pseudo-register that has not been allocated a hard
     register is considered a memory reference.  This is because in
     contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
     with no hard register must be rejected.  For non-hard registers,
     the strict variant should look up the 'reg_renumber' array; it
     should then proceed using the hard register number in the array, or
     treat the pseudo as a memory reference if the array holds '-1'.

     The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined
     to accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of
     register is required.

     Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a 'symbol_ref'
     and an integer are stored inside a 'const' RTX to mark them as
     constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
     specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
     recognize any 'const' as legitimate.

     Usually 'PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
     sums that are not marked with 'const'.  It assumes that a naked
     'plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you _must_ reject such
     naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them
     will be given to 'PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

     On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends
     on the section that the address refers to.  On these machines,
     define the target hook 'TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the
     information into the 'symbol_ref', and then check for it here.
     When you see a 'const', you will have to look inside it to find the
     'symbol_ref' in order to determine the section.  *Note Assembler
     Format::.

     Some ports are still using a deprecated legacy substitute for this
     hook, the 'GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' macro.  This macro has this
     syntax:

          #define GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, LABEL)

     and should 'goto LABEL' if the address X is a valid address on the
     target machine for a memory operand of mode MODE.

     Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
     macro define the macro 'REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an '#ifdef
     REG_OK_STRICT' conditional to define the strict variant in that
     case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

     Using the hook is usually simpler because it limits the number of
     files that are recompiled when changes are made.

 -- Macro: TARGET_MEM_CONSTRAINT
     A single character to be used instead of the default ''m''
     character for general memory addresses.  This defines the
     constraint letter which matches the memory addresses accepted by
     'TARGET_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P'.  Define this macro if you want to
     support new address formats in your back end without changing the
     semantics of the ''m'' constraint.  This is necessary in order to
     preserve functionality of inline assembly constructs using the
     ''m'' constraint.

 -- Macro: FIND_BASE_TERM (X)
     A C expression to determine the base term of address X, or to
     provide a simplified version of X from which 'alias.c' can easily
     find the base term.  This macro is used in only two places:
     'find_base_value' and 'find_base_term' in 'alias.c'.

     It is always safe for this macro to not be defined.  It exists so
     that alias analysis can understand machine-dependent addresses.

     The typical use of this macro is to handle addresses containing a
     label_ref or symbol_ref within an UNSPEC.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (rtx X, rtx OLDX, enum
          machine_mode MODE)
     This hook is given an invalid memory address X for an operand of
     mode MODE and should try to return a valid memory address.

     X will always be the result of a call to 'break_out_memory_refs',
     and OLDX will be the operand that was given to that function to
     produce X.

     The code of the hook should not alter the substructure of X.  If it
     transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should return the new
     X.

     It is not necessary for this hook to come up with a legitimate
     address, with the exception of native TLS addresses (*note Emulated
     TLS::).  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.
     In fact, if the target supports only emulated TLS, it is safe to
     omit this hook or make it return X if it cannot find a valid way to
     legitimize the address.  But often a machine-dependent strategy can
     generate better code.

 -- Macro: LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS (X, MODE, OPNUM, TYPE, IND_LEVELS,
          WIN)
     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X, which is an
     address that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an
     operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C statement label elsewhere in
     the code.  It is not necessary to define this macro, but it might
     be useful for performance reasons.

     For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
     reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
     registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
     processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate
     address needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.  By
     defining 'LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS' appropriately, the
     intermediate addresses generated for adjacent some stack slots can
     be made identical, and thus be shared.

     _Note_: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary to
     know something of how reload works in order to effectively use
     this, and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too much
     knowledge of reload internals.

     _Note_: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
     previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such
     addresses then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.

     The macro definition should use 'push_reload' to indicate parts
     that need reloading; OPNUM, TYPE and IND_LEVELS are usually
     suitable to be passed unaltered to 'push_reload'.

     The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
     X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.  This
     also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
     'push_reload'.

     The macro definition may use 'strict_memory_address_p' to test if
     the address has become legitimate.

     If you want to change only a part of X, one standard way of doing
     this is to use 'copy_rtx'.  Note, however, that it unshares only a
     single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
     top level, you'll need to replace first the top level.  It is not
     necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate address; but
     often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS_P (const_rtx ADDR,
          addr_space_t ADDRSPACE)
     This hook returns 'true' if memory address ADDR in address space
     ADDRSPACE can have different meanings depending on the machine mode
     of the memory reference it is used for or if the address is valid
     for some modes but not others.

     Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have
     mode-dependent effects because the amount of the increment or
     decrement is the size of the operand being addressed.  Some
     machines have other mode-dependent addresses.  Many RISC machines
     have no mode-dependent addresses.

     You may assume that ADDR is a valid address for the machine.

     The default version of this hook returns 'false'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (enum machine_mode
          MODE, rtx X)
     This hook returns true if X is a legitimate constant for a
     MODE-mode immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume
     that X satisfies 'CONSTANT_P', so you need not check this.

     The default definition returns true.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_DELEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (rtx X)
     This hook is used to undo the possibly obfuscating effects of the
     'LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS' and 'LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS' target macros.
     Some backend implementations of these macros wrap symbol references
     inside an 'UNSPEC' rtx to represent PIC or similar addressing
     modes.  This target hook allows GCC's optimizers to understand the
     semantics of these opaque 'UNSPEC's by converting them back into
     their original form.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CONST_NOT_OK_FOR_DEBUG_P (rtx X)
     This hook should return true if X should not be emitted into debug
     sections.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CANNOT_FORCE_CONST_MEM (enum machine_mode
          MODE, rtx X)
     This hook should return true if X is of a form that cannot (or
     should not) be spilled to the constant pool.  MODE is the mode of
     X.

     The default version of this hook returns false.

     The primary reason to define this hook is to prevent reload from
     deciding that a non-legitimate constant would be better reloaded
     from the constant pool instead of spilling and reloading a register
     holding the constant.  This restriction is often true of addresses
     of TLS symbols for various targets.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_USE_BLOCKS_FOR_CONSTANT_P (enum
          machine_mode MODE, const_rtx X)
     This hook should return true if pool entries for constant X can be
     placed in an 'object_block' structure.  MODE is the mode of X.

     The default version returns false for all constants.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_USE_BLOCKS_FOR_DECL_P (const_tree DECL)
     This hook should return true if pool entries for DECL should be
     placed in an 'object_block' structure.

     The default version returns true for all decls.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_BUILTIN_RECIPROCAL (unsigned FN, bool
          MD_FN, bool SQRT)
     This hook should return the DECL of a function that implements
     reciprocal of the builtin function with builtin function code FN,
     or 'NULL_TREE' if such a function is not available.  MD_FN is true
     when FN is a code of a machine-dependent builtin function.  When
     SQRT is true, additional optimizations that apply only to the
     reciprocal of a square root function are performed, and only
     reciprocals of 'sqrt' function are valid.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_MASK_FOR_LOAD (void)
     This hook should return the DECL of a function F that given an
     address ADDR as an argument returns a mask M that can be used to
     extract from two vectors the relevant data that resides in ADDR in
     case ADDR is not properly aligned.

     The autovectorizer, when vectorizing a load operation from an
     address ADDR that may be unaligned, will generate two vector loads
     from the two aligned addresses around ADDR.  It then generates a
     'REALIGN_LOAD' operation to extract the relevant data from the two
     loaded vectors.  The first two arguments to 'REALIGN_LOAD', V1 and
     V2, are the two vectors, each of size VS, and the third argument,
     OFF, defines how the data will be extracted from these two vectors:
     if OFF is 0, then the returned vector is V2; otherwise, the
     returned vector is composed from the last VS-OFF elements of V1
     concatenated to the first OFF elements of V2.

     If this hook is defined, the autovectorizer will generate a call to
     F (using the DECL tree that this hook returns) and will use the
     return value of F as the argument OFF to 'REALIGN_LOAD'.
     Therefore, the mask M returned by F should comply with the
     semantics expected by 'REALIGN_LOAD' described above.  If this hook
     is not defined, then ADDR will be used as the argument OFF to
     'REALIGN_LOAD', in which case the low log2(VS) - 1 bits of ADDR
     will be considered.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_VECTORIZATION_COST (enum
          vect_cost_for_stmt TYPE_OF_COST, tree VECTYPE, int MISALIGN)
     Returns cost of different scalar or vector statements for
     vectorization cost model.  For vector memory operations the cost
     may depend on type (VECTYPE) and misalignment value (MISALIGN).

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VECTORIZE_VECTOR_ALIGNMENT_REACHABLE
          (const_tree TYPE, bool IS_PACKED)
     Return true if vector alignment is reachable (by peeling N
     iterations) for the given type.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VECTORIZE_VEC_PERM_CONST_OK (enum
          MACHINE_MODE, const unsigned char *SEL)
     Return true if a vector created for 'vec_perm_const' is valid.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_CONVERSION (unsigned
          CODE, tree DEST_TYPE, tree SRC_TYPE)
     This hook should return the DECL of a function that implements
     conversion of the input vector of type SRC_TYPE to type DEST_TYPE.
     The value of CODE is one of the enumerators in 'enum tree_code' and
     specifies how the conversion is to be applied (truncation,
     rounding, etc.).

     If this hook is defined, the autovectorizer will use the
     'TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_CONVERSION' target hook when vectorizing
     conversion.  Otherwise, it will return 'NULL_TREE'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_VECTORIZED_FUNCTION (tree
          FNDECL, tree VEC_TYPE_OUT, tree VEC_TYPE_IN)
     This hook should return the decl of a function that implements the
     vectorized variant of the builtin function with builtin function
     code CODE or 'NULL_TREE' if such a function is not available.  The
     value of FNDECL is the builtin function declaration.  The return
     type of the vectorized function shall be of vector type
     VEC_TYPE_OUT and the argument types should be VEC_TYPE_IN.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VECTORIZE_SUPPORT_VECTOR_MISALIGNMENT (enum
          machine_mode MODE, const_tree TYPE, int MISALIGNMENT, bool
          IS_PACKED)
     This hook should return true if the target supports misaligned
     vector store/load of a specific factor denoted in the MISALIGNMENT
     parameter.  The vector store/load should be of machine mode MODE
     and the elements in the vectors should be of type TYPE.  IS_PACKED
     parameter is true if the memory access is defined in a packed
     struct.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_VECTORIZE_PREFERRED_SIMD_MODE
          (enum machine_mode MODE)
     This hook should return the preferred mode for vectorizing scalar
     mode MODE.  The default is equal to 'word_mode', because the
     vectorizer can do some transformations even in absence of
     specialized SIMD hardware.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int
          TARGET_VECTORIZE_AUTOVECTORIZE_VECTOR_SIZES (void)
     This hook should return a mask of sizes that should be iterated
     over after trying to autovectorize using the vector size derived
     from the mode returned by 'TARGET_VECTORIZE_PREFERRED_SIMD_MODE'.
     The default is zero which means to not iterate over other vector
     sizes.

 -- Target Hook: void * TARGET_VECTORIZE_INIT_COST (struct loop
          *LOOP_INFO)
     This hook should initialize target-specific data structures in
     preparation for modeling the costs of vectorizing a loop or basic
     block.  The default allocates three unsigned integers for
     accumulating costs for the prologue, body, and epilogue of the loop
     or basic block.  If LOOP_INFO is non-NULL, it identifies the loop
     being vectorized; otherwise a single block is being vectorized.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned TARGET_VECTORIZE_ADD_STMT_COST (void *DATA,
          int COUNT, enum vect_cost_for_stmt KIND, struct _stmt_vec_info
          *STMT_INFO, int MISALIGN, enum vect_cost_model_location WHERE)
     This hook should update the target-specific DATA in response to
     adding COUNT copies of the given KIND of statement to a loop or
     basic block.  The default adds the builtin vectorizer cost for the
     copies of the statement to the accumulator specified by WHERE, (the
     prologue, body, or epilogue) and returns the amount added.  The
     return value should be viewed as a tentative cost that may later be
     revised.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_VECTORIZE_FINISH_COST (void *DATA, unsigned
          *PROLOGUE_COST, unsigned *BODY_COST, unsigned *EPILOGUE_COST)
     This hook should complete calculations of the cost of vectorizing a
     loop or basic block based on DATA, and return the prologue, body,
     and epilogue costs as unsigned integers.  The default returns the
     value of the three accumulators.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_VECTORIZE_DESTROY_COST_DATA (void *DATA)
     This hook should release DATA and any related data structures
     allocated by TARGET_VECTORIZE_INIT_COST. The default releases the
     accumulator.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_TM_LOAD (tree)
     This hook should return the built-in decl needed to load a vector
     of the given type within a transaction.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_TM_STORE (tree)
     This hook should return the built-in decl needed to store a vector
     of the given type within a transaction.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_VECTORIZE_BUILTIN_GATHER (const_tree
          MEM_VECTYPE, const_tree INDEX_TYPE, int SCALE)
     Target builtin that implements vector gather operation.
     MEM_VECTYPE is the vector type of the load and INDEX_TYPE is scalar
     type of the index, scaled by SCALE.  The default is 'NULL_TREE'
     which means to not vectorize gather loads.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SIMD_CLONE_COMPUTE_VECSIZE_AND_SIMDLEN
          (struct cgraph_node *, struct cgraph_simd_clone *, TREE, INT)
     This hook should set VECSIZE_MANGLE, VECSIZE_INT, VECSIZE_FLOAT
     fields in SIMD_CLONE structure pointed by CLONE_INFO argument and
     also SIMDLEN field if it was previously 0.  The hook should return
     0 if SIMD clones shouldn't be emitted, or number of VECSIZE_MANGLE
     variants that should be emitted.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SIMD_CLONE_ADJUST (struct cgraph_node *)
     This hook should add implicit 'attribute(target("..."))' attribute
     to SIMD clone NODE if needed.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SIMD_CLONE_USABLE (struct cgraph_node *)
     This hook should return -1 if SIMD clone NODE shouldn't be used in
     vectorized loops in current function, or non-negative number if it
     is usable.  In that case, the smaller the number is, the more
     desirable it is to use it.

17.15 Anchored Addresses
========================

GCC usually addresses every static object as a separate entity.  For
example, if we have:

     static int a, b, c;
     int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

 the code for 'foo' will usually calculate three separate symbolic
addresses: those of 'a', 'b' and 'c'.  On some targets, it would be
better to calculate just one symbolic address and access the three
variables relative to it.  The equivalent pseudocode would be something
like:

     int foo (void)
     {
       register int *xr = &x;
       return xr[&a - &x] + xr[&b - &x] + xr[&c - &x];
     }

 (which isn't valid C). We refer to shared addresses like 'x' as
"section anchors".  Their use is controlled by '-fsection-anchors'.

 The hooks below describe the target properties that GCC needs to know
in order to make effective use of section anchors.  It won't use section
anchors at all unless either 'TARGET_MIN_ANCHOR_OFFSET' or
'TARGET_MAX_ANCHOR_OFFSET' is set to a nonzero value.

 -- Target Hook: HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_MIN_ANCHOR_OFFSET
     The minimum offset that should be applied to a section anchor.  On
     most targets, it should be the smallest offset that can be applied
     to a base register while still giving a legitimate address for
     every mode.  The default value is 0.

 -- Target Hook: HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_MAX_ANCHOR_OFFSET
     Like 'TARGET_MIN_ANCHOR_OFFSET', but the maximum (inclusive) offset
     that should be applied to section anchors.  The default value is 0.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_ANCHOR (rtx X)
     Write the assembly code to define section anchor X, which is a
     'SYMBOL_REF' for which 'SYMBOL_REF_ANCHOR_P (X)' is true.  The hook
     is called with the assembly output position set to the beginning of
     'SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK (X)'.

     If 'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' is available, the hook's default definition
     uses it to define the symbol as '. + SYMBOL_REF_BLOCK_OFFSET (X)'.
     If 'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' is not available, the hook's default definition
     is 'NULL', which disables the use of section anchors altogether.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_USE_ANCHORS_FOR_SYMBOL_P (const_rtx X)
     Return true if GCC should attempt to use anchors to access
     'SYMBOL_REF' X.  You can assume 'SYMBOL_REF_HAS_BLOCK_INFO_P (X)'
     and '!SYMBOL_REF_ANCHOR_P (X)'.

     The default version is correct for most targets, but you might need
     to intercept this hook to handle things like target-specific
     attributes or target-specific sections.

17.16 Condition Code Status
===========================

The macros in this section can be split in two families, according to
the two ways of representing condition codes in GCC.

 The first representation is the so called '(cc0)' representation (*note
Jump Patterns::), where all instructions can have an implicit clobber of
the condition codes.  The second is the condition code register
representation, which provides better schedulability for architectures
that do have a condition code register, but on which most instructions
do not affect it.  The latter category includes most RISC machines.

 The implicit clobbering poses a strong restriction on the placement of
the definition and use of the condition code.  In the past the
definition and use were always adjacent.  However, recent changes to
support trapping arithmatic may result in the definition and user being
in different blocks.  Thus, there may be a 'NOTE_INSN_BASIC_BLOCK'
between them.  Additionally, the definition may be the source of
exception handling edges.

 These restrictions can prevent important optimizations on some
machines.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a delay for taken
branches unless the condition code register is set three instructions
earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction scheduler cannot
perform this optimization if it is not permitted to separate the
definition and use of the condition code register.

 For this reason, it is possible and suggested to use a register to
represent the condition code for new ports.  If there is a specific
condition code register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the
condition code or comparison result can be placed in any general
register, or if there are multiple condition registers, use a pseudo
register.  Registers used to store the condition code value will usually
have a mode that is in class 'MODE_CC'.

 Alternatively, you can use 'BImode' if the comparison operator is
specified already in the compare instruction.  In this case, you are not
interested in most macros in this section.

File: gccint.info,  Node: CC0 Condition Codes,  Next: MODE_CC Condition Codes,  Up: Condition Code

17.16.1 Representation of condition codes using '(cc0)'
-------------------------------------------------------

The file 'conditions.h' defines a variable 'cc_status' to describe how
the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of the
condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.

 Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the
machine description header file.  It can also add additional
machine-specific information by defining 'CC_STATUS_MDEP'.

 -- Macro: CC_STATUS_MDEP
     C code for a data type which is used for declaring the 'mdep'
     component of 'cc_status'.  It defaults to 'int'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use 'cc0'.

 -- Macro: CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT
     A C expression to initialize the 'mdep' field to "empty".  The
     default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use the
     field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
     define this macro to initialize it.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use 'cc0'.

 -- Macro: NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (EXP, INSN)
     A C compound statement to set the components of 'cc_status'
     appropriately for an insn INSN whose body is EXP.  It is this
     macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
     code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that
     explicitly set '(cc0)'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use 'cc0'.

     If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
     other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
     invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
     reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
     registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
     'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave 'cc_status' unaltered for such insns.
     But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code based on
     location 'a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a new value in
     'a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it will
     no longer be true that it reflects the contents of 'a4@(102)'.
     Therefore, 'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter 'cc_status' in this case
     to say that nothing is known about the condition code value.

     The definition of 'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must be prepared to deal with
     the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
     'parallel' RTXs containing various 'reg', 'mem' or constants which
     are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these insns is not
     sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
     'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is just to run
     'CC_STATUS_INIT'.

     A possible definition of 'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function
     that looks at an attribute (*note Insn Attributes::) named, for
     example, 'cc'.  This avoids having detailed information about
     patterns in two places, the 'md' file and in 'NOTICE_UPDATE_CC'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: MODE_CC Condition Codes,  Prev: CC0 Condition Codes,  Up: Condition Code

17.16.2 Representation of condition codes using registers
---------------------------------------------------------

 -- Macro: SELECT_CC_MODE (OP, X, Y)
     On many machines, the condition code may be produced by other
     instructions than compares, for example the branch can use directly
     the condition code set by a subtract instruction.  However, on some
     machines when the condition code is set this way some bits (such as
     the overflow bit) are not set in the same way as a test
     instruction, so that a different branch instruction must be used
     for some conditional branches.  When this happens, use the machine
     mode of the condition code register to record different formats of
     the condition code register.  Modes can also be used to record
     which compare instruction (e.g.  a signed or an unsigned
     comparison) produced the condition codes.

     If other modes than 'CCmode' are required, add them to
     'MACHINE-modes.def' and define 'SELECT_CC_MODE' to choose a mode
     given an operand of a compare.  This is needed because the modes
     have to be chosen not only during RTL generation but also, for
     example, by instruction combination.  The result of
     'SELECT_CC_MODE' should be consistent with the mode used in the
     patterns; for example to support the case of the add on the SPARC
     discussed above, we have the pattern

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
                  (compare:CC_NOOV
                    (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
                             (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
                    (const_int 0)))]
            ""
            "...")

     together with a 'SELECT_CC_MODE' that returns 'CC_NOOVmode' for
     comparisons whose argument is a 'plus':

          #define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
            (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT          \
             ? ((OP == EQ || OP == NE) ? CCFPmode : CCFPEmode)    \
             : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS    \
                 || GET_CODE (X) == NEG) \
                ? CC_NOOVmode : CCmode))

     Another reason to use modes is to retain information on which
     operands were used by the comparison; see 'REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE'
     later in this section.

     You should define this macro if and only if you define extra CC
     modes in 'MACHINE-modes.def'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (int *CODE, rtx
          *OP0, rtx *OP1, bool OP0_PRESERVE_VALUE)
     On some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but you
     can convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For example,
     the Alpha does not have a 'GT' comparison, but you can use an 'LT'
     comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

     On such machines, implement this hook to do any required
     conversions.  CODE is the initial comparison code and OP0 and OP1
     are the left and right operands of the comparison, respectively.
     If OP0_PRESERVE_VALUE is 'true' the implementation is not allowed
     to change the value of OP0 since the value might be used in RTXs
     which aren't comparisons.  E.g.  the implementation is not allowed
     to swap operands in that case.

     GCC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this macro
     is valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a pattern in
     the 'md' file.

     You need not to implement this hook if it would never change the
     comparison code or operands.

 -- Macro: REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)
     A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
     comparison whose mode is MODE.  If 'SELECT_CC_MODE' can ever return
     MODE for a floating-point inequality comparison, then
     'REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' must be zero.

     You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or
     if the floating-point format is anything other than
     'IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'.  For example, here is the definition used on
     the SPARC, where floating-point inequality comparisons are always
     given 'CCFPEmode':

          #define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE)  ((MODE) != CCFPEmode)

 -- Macro: REVERSE_CONDITION (CODE, MODE)
     A C expression whose value is reversed condition code of the CODE
     for comparison done in CC_MODE MODE.  The macro is used only in
     case 'REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' is nonzero.  Define this macro in
     case machine has some non-standard way how to reverse certain
     conditionals.  For instance in case all floating point conditions
     are non-trapping, compiler may freely convert unordered compares to
     ordered one.  Then definition may look like:

          #define REVERSE_CONDITION(CODE, MODE) \
             ((MODE) != CCFPmode ? reverse_condition (CODE) \
              : reverse_condition_maybe_unordered (CODE))

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FIXED_CONDITION_CODE_REGS (unsigned int
          *P1, unsigned int *P2)
     On targets which do not use '(cc0)', and which use a hard register
     rather than a pseudo-register to hold condition codes, the regular
     CSE passes are often not able to identify cases in which the hard
     register is set to a common value.  Use this hook to enable a small
     pass which optimizes such cases.  This hook should return true to
     enable this pass, and it should set the integers to which its
     arguments point to the hard register numbers used for condition
     codes.  When there is only one such register, as is true on most
     systems, the integer pointed to by P2 should be set to
     'INVALID_REGNUM'.

     The default version of this hook returns false.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_CC_MODES_COMPATIBLE (enum
          machine_mode M1, enum machine_mode M2)
     On targets which use multiple condition code modes in class
     'MODE_CC', it is sometimes the case that a comparison can be
     validly done in more than one mode.  On such a system, define this
     target hook to take two mode arguments and to return a mode in
     which both comparisons may be validly done.  If there is no such
     mode, return 'VOIDmode'.

     The default version of this hook checks whether the modes are the
     same.  If they are, it returns that mode.  If they are different,
     it returns 'VOIDmode'.

17.17 Describing Relative Costs of Operations
=============================================

These macros let you describe the relative speed of various operations
on the target machine.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_MOVE_COST (MODE, FROM, TO)
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode MODE from a
     register in class FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are
     expressed using the enumeration values such as 'GENERAL_REGS'.  A
     value of 2 is the default; other values are interpreted relative to
     that.

     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
     registers if they are not general registers.

     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single 'set' between two
     hard registers, and if 'REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
     should do this if the 'movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
     such copying.

     These macros are obsolete, new ports should use the target hook
     'TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST' instead.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST (enum machine_mode MODE,
          reg_class_t FROM, reg_class_t TO)
     This target hook should return the cost of moving data of mode MODE
     from a register in class FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are
     expressed using the enumeration values such as 'GENERAL_REGS'.  A
     value of 2 is the default; other values are interpreted relative to
     that.

     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
     registers if they are not general registers.

     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single 'set' between two
     hard registers, and if 'TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
     should do this if the 'movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
     such copying.

     The default version of this function returns 2.

 -- Macro: MEMORY_MOVE_COST (MODE, CLASS, IN)
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode MODE between a
     register of class CLASS and memory; IN is zero if the value is to
     be written to memory, nonzero if it is to be read in.  This cost is
     relative to those in 'REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.  If moving between
     registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers,
     you should define this macro to express the relative cost.

     If you do not define this macro, GCC uses a default cost of 4 plus
     the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
     needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to
     copy between memory and a register of CLASS but the reload
     mechanism is more complex than copying via an intermediate, define
     this macro to reflect the actual cost of the move.

     GCC defines the function 'memory_move_secondary_cost' if secondary
     reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via a
     secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
     secondary register in the conventional way but the default base
     value of 4 is not correct for your machine, define this macro to
     add some other value to the result of that function.  The arguments
     to that function are the same as to this macro.

     These macros are obsolete, new ports should use the target hook
     'TARGET_MEMORY_MOVE_COST' instead.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_MEMORY_MOVE_COST (enum machine_mode MODE,
          reg_class_t RCLASS, bool IN)
     This target hook should return the cost of moving data of mode MODE
     between a register of class RCLASS and memory; IN is 'false' if the
     value is to be written to memory, 'true' if it is to be read in.
     This cost is relative to those in 'TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.  If
     moving between registers and memory is more expensive than between
     two registers, you should add this target hook to express the
     relative cost.

     If you do not add this target hook, GCC uses a default cost of 4
     plus the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
     needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to
     copy between memory and a register of RCLASS but the reload
     mechanism is more complex than copying via an intermediate, use
     this target hook to reflect the actual cost of the move.

     GCC defines the function 'memory_move_secondary_cost' if secondary
     reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via a
     secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
     secondary register in the conventional way but the default base
     value of 4 is not correct for your machine, use this target hook to
     add some other value to the result of that function.  The arguments
     to that function are the same as to this target hook.

 -- Macro: BRANCH_COST (SPEED_P, PREDICTABLE_P)
     A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1
     is the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.
     Parameter SPEED_P is true when the branch in question should be
     optimized for speed.  When it is false, 'BRANCH_COST' should return
     a value optimal for code size rather than performance.
     PREDICTABLE_P is true for well-predicted branches.  On many
     architectures the 'BRANCH_COST' can be reduced then.

 Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative costs,
but only that certain actions are more expensive than GCC would
ordinarily expect.

 -- Macro: SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing
     less than a word of memory (i.e. a 'char' or a 'short') is no
     faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
     require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in
     cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.

     When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
     finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a
     fullword load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes
     accesses are faster than word accesses, using word accesses is
     preferable since it may eliminate subsequent memory access if
     subsequent accesses occur to other fields in the same word of the
     structure, but to different bytes.

 -- Macro: SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS (MODE, ALIGNMENT)
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if memory accesses described by
     the MODE and ALIGNMENT parameters have a cost many times greater
     than aligned accesses, for example if they are emulated in a trap
     handler.

     When this macro is nonzero, the compiler will act as if
     'STRICT_ALIGNMENT' were nonzero when generating code for block
     moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be
     produced.  Therefore, do not set this macro nonzero if unaligned
     accesses only add a cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

     If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.
     If this macro is defined, it should produce a nonzero value when
     'STRICT_ALIGNMENT' is nonzero.

 -- Macro: MOVE_RATIO (SPEED)
     The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns,
     _below_ which a sequence of insns should be generated instead of a
     string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will
     always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     Note that on machines where the corresponding move insn is a
     'define_expand' that emits a sequence of insns, this macro counts
     the number of such sequences.

     The parameter SPEED is true if the code is currently being
     optimized for speed rather than size.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

 -- Macro: MOVE_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether 'move_by_pieces' will be
     used to copy a chunk of memory, or whether some other block move
     mechanism will be used.  Defaults to 1 if 'move_by_pieces_ninsns'
     returns less than 'MOVE_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: MOVE_MAX_PIECES
     A C expression used by 'move_by_pieces' to determine the largest
     unit a load or store used to copy memory is.  Defaults to
     'MOVE_MAX'.

 -- Macro: CLEAR_RATIO (SPEED)
     The threshold of number of scalar move insns, _below_ which a
     sequence of insns should be generated to clear memory instead of a
     string clear insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will
     always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     The parameter SPEED is true if the code is currently being
     optimized for speed rather than size.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

 -- Macro: CLEAR_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether 'clear_by_pieces' will be
     used to clear a chunk of memory, or whether some other block clear
     mechanism will be used.  Defaults to 1 if 'move_by_pieces_ninsns'
     returns less than 'CLEAR_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: SET_RATIO (SPEED)
     The threshold of number of scalar move insns, _below_ which a
     sequence of insns should be generated to set memory to a constant
     value, instead of a block set insn or a library call.  Increasing
     the value will always make code faster, but eventually incurs high
     cost in increased code size.

     The parameter SPEED is true if the code is currently being
     optimized for speed rather than size.

     If you don't define this, it defaults to the value of 'MOVE_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: SET_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether 'store_by_pieces' will be
     used to set a chunk of memory to a constant value, or whether some
     other mechanism will be used.  Used by '__builtin_memset' when
     storing values other than constant zero.  Defaults to 1 if
     'move_by_pieces_ninsns' returns less than 'SET_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: STORE_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C expression used to determine whether 'store_by_pieces' will be
     used to set a chunk of memory to a constant string value, or
     whether some other mechanism will be used.  Used by
     '__builtin_strcpy' when called with a constant source string.
     Defaults to 1 if 'move_by_pieces_ninsns' returns less than
     'MOVE_RATIO'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load postincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load postdecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load preincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_LOAD_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a load predecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a store postincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)
     A C expression used to determine whether a store postdecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)
     This macro is used to determine whether a store preincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.

 -- Macro: USE_STORE_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)
     This macro is used to determine whether a store predecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     'HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.

 -- Macro: NO_FUNCTION_CSE
     Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
     function address than to call an address kept in a register.

 -- Macro: LOGICAL_OP_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT
     Define this macro if a non-short-circuit operation produced by
     'fold_range_test ()' is optimal.  This macro defaults to true if
     'BRANCH_COST' is greater than or equal to the value 2.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RTX_COSTS (rtx X, int CODE, int OUTER_CODE,
          int OPNO, int *TOTAL, bool SPEED)
     This target hook describes the relative costs of RTL expressions.

     The cost may depend on the precise form of the expression, which is
     available for examination in X, and the fact that X appears as
     operand OPNO of an expression with rtx code OUTER_CODE.  That is,
     the hook can assume that there is some rtx Y such that 'GET_CODE
     (Y) == OUTER_CODE' and such that either (a) 'XEXP (Y, OPNO) == X'
     or (b) 'XVEC (Y, OPNO)' contains X.

     CODE is X's expression code--redundant, since it can be obtained
     with 'GET_CODE (X)'.

     In implementing this hook, you can use the construct 'COSTS_N_INSNS
     (N)' to specify a cost equal to N fast instructions.

     On entry to the hook, '*TOTAL' contains a default estimate for the
     cost of the expression.  The hook should modify this value as
     necessary.  Traditionally, the default costs are 'COSTS_N_INSNS
     (5)' for multiplications, 'COSTS_N_INSNS (7)' for division and
     modulus operations, and 'COSTS_N_INSNS (1)' for all other
     operations.

     When optimizing for code size, i.e. when 'speed' is false, this
     target hook should be used to estimate the relative size cost of an
     expression, again relative to 'COSTS_N_INSNS'.

     The hook returns true when all subexpressions of X have been
     processed, and false when 'rtx_cost' should recurse.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ADDRESS_COST (rtx ADDRESS, enum machine_mode
          MODE, addr_space_t AS, bool SPEED)
     This hook computes the cost of an addressing mode that contains
     ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
     expression and the 'TARGET_RTX_COST' hook.

     For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation of
     the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC machines,
     all instructions normally have the same length and execution time.
     Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

     In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
     with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
     same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

     For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
     register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
     When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
     register and memory references will be indirect through that
     register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
     containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
     reference, this will produce an additional instruction and possibly
     require an additional register.  Proper specification of this macro
     eliminates this overhead for such machines.

     This hook is never called with an invalid address.

     On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
     cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
     defining 'TARGET_ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two
     registers to be live over a region of code where only one would
     have been if 'TARGET_ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.
     This effect should be considered in the definition of this macro.
     Equivalent costs should probably only be given to addresses with
     different numbers of registers on machines with lots of registers.

17.18 Adjusting the Instruction Scheduler
=========================================

The instruction scheduler may need a fair amount of machine-specific
adjustment in order to produce good code.  GCC provides several target
hooks for this purpose.  It is usually enough to define just a few of
them: try the first ones in this list first.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_ISSUE_RATE (void)
     This hook returns the maximum number of instructions that can ever
     issue at the same time on the target machine.  The default is one.
     Although the insn scheduler can define itself the possibility of
     issue an insn on the same cycle, the value can serve as an
     additional constraint to issue insns on the same simulated
     processor cycle (see hooks 'TARGET_SCHED_REORDER' and
     'TARGET_SCHED_REORDER2').  This value must be constant over the
     entire compilation.  If you need it to vary depending on what the
     instructions are, you must use 'TARGET_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE (FILE *FILE, int
          VERBOSE, rtx INSN, int MORE)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler after it has scheduled an
     insn from the ready list.  It should return the number of insns
     which can still be issued in the current cycle.  The default is
     'MORE - 1' for insns other than 'CLOBBER' and 'USE', which normally
     are not counted against the issue rate.  You should define this
     hook if some insns take more machine resources than others, so that
     fewer insns can follow them in the same cycle.  FILE is either a
     null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output to.
     VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by '-fsched-verbose-N'.  INSN
     is the instruction that was scheduled.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_ADJUST_COST (rtx INSN, rtx LINK, rtx
          DEP_INSN, int COST)
     This function corrects the value of COST based on the relationship
     between INSN and DEP_INSN through the dependence LINK.  It should
     return the new value.  The default is to make no adjustment to
     COST.  This can be used for example to specify to the scheduler
     using the traditional pipeline description that an output- or
     anti-dependence does not incur the same cost as a data-dependence.
     If the scheduler using the automaton based pipeline description,
     the cost of anti-dependence is zero and the cost of
     output-dependence is maximum of one and the difference of latency
     times of the first and the second insns.  If these values are not
     acceptable, you could use the hook to modify them too.  See also
     *note Processor pipeline description::.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_ADJUST_PRIORITY (rtx INSN, int
          PRIORITY)
     This hook adjusts the integer scheduling priority PRIORITY of INSN.
     It should return the new priority.  Increase the priority to
     execute INSN earlier, reduce the priority to execute INSN later.
     Do not define this hook if you do not need to adjust the scheduling
     priorities of insns.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_REORDER (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE, rtx
          *READY, int *N_READYP, int CLOCK)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler after it has scheduled the
     ready list, to allow the machine description to reorder it (for
     example to combine two small instructions together on 'VLIW'
     machines).  FILE is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to
     write any debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level provided
     by '-fsched-verbose-N'.  READY is a pointer to the ready list of
     instructions that are ready to be scheduled.  N_READYP is a pointer
     to the number of elements in the ready list.  The scheduler reads
     the ready list in reverse order, starting with READY[*N_READYP - 1]
     and going to READY[0].  CLOCK is the timer tick of the scheduler.
     You may modify the ready list and the number of ready insns.  The
     return value is the number of insns that can issue this cycle;
     normally this is just 'issue_rate'.  See also
     'TARGET_SCHED_REORDER2'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_REORDER2 (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE, rtx
          *READY, int *N_READYP, int CLOCK)
     Like 'TARGET_SCHED_REORDER', but called at a different time.  That
     function is called whenever the scheduler starts a new cycle.  This
     one is called once per iteration over a cycle, immediately after
     'TARGET_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE'; it can reorder the ready list and
     return the number of insns to be scheduled in the same cycle.
     Defining this hook can be useful if there are frequent situations
     where scheduling one insn causes other insns to become ready in the
     same cycle.  These other insns can then be taken into account
     properly.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCHED_MACRO_FUSION_P (void)
     This hook is used to check whether target platform supports macro
     fusion.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCHED_MACRO_FUSION_PAIR_P (rtx CONDGEN, rtx
          CONDJMP)
     This hook is used to check whether two insns could be macro fused
     for target microarchitecture.  If this hook returns true for the
     given insn pair (CONDGEN and CONDJMP), scheduler will put them into
     a sched group, and they will not be scheduled apart.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_DEPENDENCIES_EVALUATION_HOOK (rtx
          HEAD, rtx TAIL)
     This hook is called after evaluation forward dependencies of insns
     in chain given by two parameter values (HEAD and TAIL
     correspondingly) but before insns scheduling of the insn chain.
     For example, it can be used for better insn classification if it
     requires analysis of dependencies.  This hook can use backward and
     forward dependencies of the insn scheduler because they are already
     calculated.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE, int
          MAX_READY)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler at the beginning of each
     block of instructions that are to be scheduled.  FILE is either a
     null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output to.
     VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by '-fsched-verbose-N'.
     MAX_READY is the maximum number of insns in the current scheduling
     region that can be live at the same time.  This can be used to
     allocate scratch space if it is needed, e.g. by
     'TARGET_SCHED_REORDER'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FINISH (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler at the end of each block of
     instructions that are to be scheduled.  It can be used to perform
     cleanup of any actions done by the other scheduling hooks.  FILE is
     either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output
     to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level provided by '-fsched-verbose-N'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_GLOBAL (FILE *FILE, int VERBOSE,
          int OLD_MAX_UID)
     This hook is executed by the scheduler after function level
     initializations.  FILE is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream
     to write any debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose level
     provided by '-fsched-verbose-N'.  OLD_MAX_UID is the maximum insn
     uid when scheduling begins.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FINISH_GLOBAL (FILE *FILE, int
          VERBOSE)
     This is the cleanup hook corresponding to
     'TARGET_SCHED_INIT_GLOBAL'.  FILE is either a null pointer, or a
     stdio stream to write any debug output to.  VERBOSE is the verbose
     level provided by '-fsched-verbose-N'.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_SCHED_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook returns an RTL insn.  The automaton state used in the
     pipeline hazard recognizer is changed as if the insn were scheduled
     when the new simulated processor cycle starts.  Usage of the hook
     may simplify the automaton pipeline description for some VLIW
     processors.  If the hook is defined, it is used only for the
     automaton based pipeline description.  The default is not to change
     the state when the new simulated processor cycle starts.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook can be used to initialize data used by the previous hook.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_SCHED_DFA_POST_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook is analogous to 'TARGET_SCHED_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN' but used
     to changed the state as if the insn were scheduled when the new
     simulated processor cycle finishes.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_POST_CYCLE_INSN (void)
     The hook is analogous to 'TARGET_SCHED_INIT_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN' but
     used to initialize data used by the previous hook.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_DFA_PRE_ADVANCE_CYCLE (void)
     The hook to notify target that the current simulated cycle is about
     to finish.  The hook is analogous to
     'TARGET_SCHED_DFA_PRE_CYCLE_INSN' but used to change the state in
     more complicated situations - e.g., when advancing state on a
     single insn is not enough.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_DFA_POST_ADVANCE_CYCLE (void)
     The hook to notify target that new simulated cycle has just
     started.  The hook is analogous to
     'TARGET_SCHED_DFA_POST_CYCLE_INSN' but used to change the state in
     more complicated situations - e.g., when advancing state on a
     single insn is not enough.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD
          (void)
     This hook controls better choosing an insn from the ready insn
     queue for the DFA-based insn scheduler.  Usually the scheduler
     chooses the first insn from the queue.  If the hook returns a
     positive value, an additional scheduler code tries all permutations
     of 'TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD ()' subsequent
     ready insns to choose an insn whose issue will result in maximal
     number of issued insns on the same cycle.  For the VLIW processor,
     the code could actually solve the problem of packing simple insns
     into the VLIW insn.  Of course, if the rules of VLIW packing are
     described in the automaton.

     This code also could be used for superscalar RISC processors.  Let
     us consider a superscalar RISC processor with 3 pipelines.  Some
     insns can be executed in pipelines A or B, some insns can be
     executed only in pipelines B or C, and one insn can be executed in
     pipeline B.  The processor may issue the 1st insn into A and the
     2nd one into B.  In this case, the 3rd insn will wait for freeing B
     until the next cycle.  If the scheduler issues the 3rd insn the
     first, the processor could issue all 3 insns per cycle.

     Actually this code demonstrates advantages of the automaton based
     pipeline hazard recognizer.  We try quickly and easy many insn
     schedules to choose the best one.

     The default is no multipass scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: int
          TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD_GUARD (rtx
          INSN)

     This hook controls what insns from the ready insn queue will be
     considered for the multipass insn scheduling.  If the hook returns
     zero for INSN, the insn will be not chosen to be issued.

     The default is that any ready insns can be chosen to be issued.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_BEGIN (void
          *DATA, char *READY_TRY, int N_READY, bool FIRST_CYCLE_INSN_P)
     This hook prepares the target backend for a new round of multipass
     scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_ISSUE (void
          *DATA, char *READY_TRY, int N_READY, rtx INSN, const void
          *PREV_DATA)
     This hook is called when multipass scheduling evaluates instruction
     INSN.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_BACKTRACK
          (const void *DATA, char *READY_TRY, int N_READY)
     This is called when multipass scheduling backtracks from evaluation
     of an instruction.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_END (const void
          *DATA)
     This hook notifies the target about the result of the concluded
     current round of multipass scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_INIT (void
          *DATA)
     This hook initializes target-specific data used in multipass
     scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_FINI (void
          *DATA)
     This hook finalizes target-specific data used in multipass
     scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_DFA_NEW_CYCLE (FILE *DUMP, int
          VERBOSE, rtx INSN, int LAST_CLOCK, int CLOCK, int *SORT_P)
     This hook is called by the insn scheduler before issuing INSN on
     cycle CLOCK.  If the hook returns nonzero, INSN is not issued on
     this processor cycle.  Instead, the processor cycle is advanced.
     If *SORT_P is zero, the insn ready queue is not sorted on the new
     cycle start as usually.  DUMP and VERBOSE specify the file and
     verbosity level to use for debugging output.  LAST_CLOCK and CLOCK
     are, respectively, the processor cycle on which the previous insn
     has been issued, and the current processor cycle.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCHED_IS_COSTLY_DEPENDENCE (struct _dep
          *_DEP, int COST, int DISTANCE)
     This hook is used to define which dependences are considered costly
     by the target, so costly that it is not advisable to schedule the
     insns that are involved in the dependence too close to one another.
     The parameters to this hook are as follows: The first parameter
     _DEP is the dependence being evaluated.  The second parameter COST
     is the cost of the dependence as estimated by the scheduler, and
     the third parameter DISTANCE is the distance in cycles between the
     two insns.  The hook returns 'true' if considering the distance
     between the two insns the dependence between them is considered
     costly by the target, and 'false' otherwise.

     Defining this hook can be useful in multiple-issue out-of-order
     machines, where (a) it's practically hopeless to predict the actual
     data/resource delays, however: (b) there's a better chance to
     predict the actual grouping that will be formed, and (c) correctly
     emulating the grouping can be very important.  In such targets one
     may want to allow issuing dependent insns closer to one
     another--i.e., closer than the dependence distance; however, not in
     cases of "costly dependences", which this hooks allows to define.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_H_I_D_EXTENDED (void)
     This hook is called by the insn scheduler after emitting a new
     instruction to the instruction stream.  The hook notifies a target
     backend to extend its per instruction data structures.

 -- Target Hook: void * TARGET_SCHED_ALLOC_SCHED_CONTEXT (void)
     Return a pointer to a store large enough to hold target scheduling
     context.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_INIT_SCHED_CONTEXT (void *TC, bool
          CLEAN_P)
     Initialize store pointed to by TC to hold target scheduling
     context.  It CLEAN_P is true then initialize TC as if scheduler is
     at the beginning of the block.  Otherwise, copy the current context
     into TC.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_SET_SCHED_CONTEXT (void *TC)
     Copy target scheduling context pointed to by TC to the current
     context.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_CLEAR_SCHED_CONTEXT (void *TC)
     Deallocate internal data in target scheduling context pointed to by
     TC.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_FREE_SCHED_CONTEXT (void *TC)
     Deallocate a store for target scheduling context pointed to by TC.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_SPECULATE_INSN (rtx INSN, unsigned int
          DEP_STATUS, rtx *NEW_PAT)
     This hook is called by the insn scheduler when INSN has only
     speculative dependencies and therefore can be scheduled
     speculatively.  The hook is used to check if the pattern of INSN
     has a speculative version and, in case of successful check, to
     generate that speculative pattern.  The hook should return 1, if
     the instruction has a speculative form, or -1, if it doesn't.
     REQUEST describes the type of requested speculation.  If the return
     value equals 1 then NEW_PAT is assigned the generated speculative
     pattern.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCHED_NEEDS_BLOCK_P (unsigned int
          DEP_STATUS)
     This hook is called by the insn scheduler during generation of
     recovery code for INSN.  It should return 'true', if the
     corresponding check instruction should branch to recovery code, or
     'false' otherwise.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_SCHED_GEN_SPEC_CHECK (rtx INSN, rtx LABEL,
          unsigned int DS)
     This hook is called by the insn scheduler to generate a pattern for
     recovery check instruction.  If MUTATE_P is zero, then INSN is a
     speculative instruction for which the check should be generated.
     LABEL is either a label of a basic block, where recovery code
     should be emitted, or a null pointer, when requested check doesn't
     branch to recovery code (a simple check).  If MUTATE_P is nonzero,
     then a pattern for a branchy check corresponding to a simple check
     denoted by INSN should be generated.  In this case LABEL can't be
     null.

 -- Target Hook: bool
          TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD_GUARD_SPEC
          (const_rtx INSN)
     This hook is used as a workaround for
     'TARGET_SCHED_FIRST_CYCLE_MULTIPASS_DFA_LOOKAHEAD_GUARD' not being
     called on the first instruction of the ready list.  The hook is
     used to discard speculative instructions that stand first in the
     ready list from being scheduled on the current cycle.  If the hook
     returns 'false', INSN will not be chosen to be issued.  For
     non-speculative instructions, the hook should always return 'true'.
     For example, in the ia64 backend the hook is used to cancel data
     speculative insns when the ALAT table is nearly full.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_SET_SCHED_FLAGS (struct spec_info_def
          *SPEC_INFO)
     This hook is used by the insn scheduler to find out what features
     should be enabled/used.  The structure *SPEC_INFO should be filled
     in by the target.  The structure describes speculation types that
     can be used in the scheduler.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_SMS_RES_MII (struct ddg *G)
     This hook is called by the swing modulo scheduler to calculate a
     resource-based lower bound which is based on the resources
     available in the machine and the resources required by each
     instruction.  The target backend can use G to calculate such bound.
     A very simple lower bound will be used in case this hook is not
     implemented: the total number of instructions divided by the issue
     rate.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCHED_DISPATCH (rtx INSN, int X)
     This hook is called by Haifa Scheduler.  It returns true if
     dispatch scheduling is supported in hardware and the condition
     specified in the parameter is true.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SCHED_DISPATCH_DO (rtx INSN, int X)
     This hook is called by Haifa Scheduler.  It performs the operation
     specified in its second parameter.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_SCHED_EXPOSED_PIPELINE
     True if the processor has an exposed pipeline, which means that not
     just the order of instructions is important for correctness when
     scheduling, but also the latencies of operations.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_SCHED_REASSOCIATION_WIDTH (unsigned int OPC,
          enum machine_mode MODE)
     This hook is called by tree reassociator to determine a level of
     parallelism required in output calculations chain.

17.19 Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)
==========================================================

An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the "text
section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the "data
section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss section",
which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds of
sections.

 'varasm.c' provides several well-known sections, such as
'text_section', 'data_section' and 'bss_section'.  The normal way of
controlling a 'FOO_section' variable is to define the associated
'FOO_SECTION_ASM_OP' macro, as described below.  The macros are only
read once, when 'varasm.c' initializes itself, so their values must be
run-time constants.  They may however depend on command-line flags.

 _Note:_ Some run-time files, such 'crtstuff.c', also make use of the
'FOO_SECTION_ASM_OP' macros, and expect them to be string literals.

 Some assemblers require a different string to be written every time a
section is selected.  If your assembler falls into this category, you
should define the 'TARGET_ASM_INIT_SECTIONS' hook and use
'get_unnamed_section' to set up the sections.

 You must always create a 'text_section', either by defining
'TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP' or by initializing 'text_section' in
'TARGET_ASM_INIT_SECTIONS'.  The same is true of 'data_section' and
'DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  If you do not create a distinct
'readonly_data_section', the default is to reuse 'text_section'.

 All the other 'varasm.c' sections are optional, and are null if the
target does not provide them.

 -- Macro: TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP
     A C expression whose value is a string, including spacing,
     containing the assembler operation that should precede instructions
     and read-only data.  Normally '"\t.text"' is right.

 -- Macro: HOT_TEXT_SECTION_NAME
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing most frequently executed functions of the program.  If
     not defined, GCC will provide a default definition if the target
     supports named sections.

 -- Macro: UNLIKELY_EXECUTED_TEXT_SECTION_NAME
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing unlikely executed functions in the program.

 -- Macro: DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP
     A C expression whose value is a string, including spacing,
     containing the assembler operation to identify the following data
     as writable initialized data.  Normally '"\t.data"' is right.

 -- Macro: SDATA_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as initialized, writable small data.

 -- Macro: READONLY_DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP
     A C expression whose value is a string, including spacing,
     containing the assembler operation to identify the following data
     as read-only initialized data.

 -- Macro: BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as uninitialized global data.  If not defined, and
     'ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' not defined, uninitialized global data
     will be output in the data section if '-fno-common' is passed,
     otherwise 'ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' will be used.

 -- Macro: SBSS_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as uninitialized, writable small data.

 -- Macro: TLS_COMMON_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as thread-local
     common data.  The default is '".tls_common"'.

 -- Macro: TLS_SECTION_ASM_FLAG
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a character constant
     containing the flag used to mark a section as a TLS section.  The
     default is ''T''.

 -- Macro: INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as initialization code.  If not defined, GCC will
     assume such a section does not exist.  This section has no
     corresponding 'init_section' variable; it is used entirely in
     runtime code.

 -- Macro: FINI_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as finalization code.  If not defined, GCC will
     assume such a section does not exist.  This section has no
     corresponding 'fini_section' variable; it is used entirely in
     runtime code.

 -- Macro: INIT_ARRAY_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as part of the '.init_array' (or equivalent)
     section.  If not defined, GCC will assume such a section does not
     exist.  Do not define both this macro and 'INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.

 -- Macro: FINI_ARRAY_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string, including
     spacing, containing the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as part of the '.fini_array' (or equivalent)
     section.  If not defined, GCC will assume such a section does not
     exist.  Do not define both this macro and 'FINI_SECTION_ASM_OP'.

 -- Macro: CRT_CALL_STATIC_FUNCTION (SECTION_OP, FUNCTION)
     If defined, an ASM statement that switches to a different section
     via SECTION_OP, calls FUNCTION, and switches back to the text
     section.  This is used in 'crtstuff.c' if 'INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' or
     'FINI_SECTION_ASM_OP' to calls to initialization and finalization
     functions from the init and fini sections.  By default, this macro
     uses a simple function call.  Some ports need hand-crafted assembly
     code to avoid dependencies on registers initialized in the function
     prologue or to ensure that constant pools don't end up too far way
     in the text section.

 -- Macro: TARGET_LIBGCC_SDATA_SECTION
     If defined, a string which names the section into which small
     variables defined in crtstuff and libgcc should go.  This is useful
     when the target has options for optimizing access to small data,
     and you want the crtstuff and libgcc routines to be conservative in
     what they expect of your application yet liberal in what your
     application expects.  For example, for targets with a '.sdata'
     section (like MIPS), you could compile crtstuff with '-G 0' so that
     it doesn't require small data support from your application, but
     use this macro to put small data into '.sdata' so that your
     application can access these variables whether it uses small data
     or not.

 -- Macro: FORCE_CODE_SECTION_ALIGN
     If defined, an ASM statement that aligns a code section to some
     arbitrary boundary.  This is used to force all fragments of the
     '.init' and '.fini' sections to have to same alignment and thus
     prevent the linker from having to add any padding.

 -- Macro: JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION
     Define this macro to be an expression with a nonzero value if jump
     tables (for 'tablejump' insns) should be output in the text
     section, along with the assembler instructions.  Otherwise, the
     readonly data section is used.

     This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
     section.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_INIT_SECTIONS (void)
     Define this hook if you need to do something special to set up the
     'varasm.c' sections, or if your target has some special sections of
     its own that you need to create.

     GCC calls this hook after processing the command line, but before
     writing any assembly code, and before calling any of the
     section-returning hooks described below.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ASM_RELOC_RW_MASK (void)
     Return a mask describing how relocations should be treated when
     selecting sections.  Bit 1 should be set if global relocations
     should be placed in a read-write section; bit 0 should be set if
     local relocations should be placed in a read-write section.

     The default version of this function returns 3 when '-fpic' is in
     effect, and 0 otherwise.  The hook is typically redefined when the
     target cannot support (some kinds of) dynamic relocations in
     read-only sections even in executables.

 -- Target Hook: section * TARGET_ASM_SELECT_SECTION (tree EXP, int
          RELOC, unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT ALIGN)
     Return the section into which EXP should be placed.  You can assume
     that EXP is either a 'VAR_DECL' node or a constant of some sort.
     RELOC indicates whether the initial value of EXP requires link-time
     relocations.  Bit 0 is set when variable contains local relocations
     only, while bit 1 is set for global relocations.  ALIGN is the
     constant alignment in bits.

     The default version of this function takes care of putting
     read-only variables in 'readonly_data_section'.

     See also USE_SELECT_SECTION_FOR_FUNCTIONS.

 -- Macro: USE_SELECT_SECTION_FOR_FUNCTIONS
     Define this macro if you wish TARGET_ASM_SELECT_SECTION to be
     called for 'FUNCTION_DECL's as well as for variables and constants.

     In the case of a 'FUNCTION_DECL', RELOC will be zero if the
     function has been determined to be likely to be called, and nonzero
     if it is unlikely to be called.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_UNIQUE_SECTION (tree DECL, int RELOC)
     Build up a unique section name, expressed as a 'STRING_CST' node,
     and assign it to 'DECL_SECTION_NAME (DECL)'.  As with
     'TARGET_ASM_SELECT_SECTION', RELOC indicates whether the initial
     value of EXP requires link-time relocations.

     The default version of this function appends the symbol name to the
     ELF section name that would normally be used for the symbol.  For
     example, the function 'foo' would be placed in '.text.foo'.
     Whatever the actual target object format, this is often good
     enough.

 -- Target Hook: section * TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_RODATA_SECTION (tree
          DECL)
     Return the readonly data section associated with 'DECL_SECTION_NAME
     (DECL)'.  The default version of this function selects
     '.gnu.linkonce.r.name' if the function's section is
     '.gnu.linkonce.t.name', '.rodata.name' if function is in
     '.text.name', and the normal readonly-data section otherwise.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_MERGEABLE_RODATA_PREFIX
     Usually, the compiler uses the prefix '".rodata"' to construct
     section names for mergeable constant data.  Define this macro to
     override the string if a different section name should be used.

 -- Target Hook: section * TARGET_ASM_TM_CLONE_TABLE_SECTION (void)
     Return the section that should be used for transactional memory
     clone tables.

 -- Target Hook: section * TARGET_ASM_SELECT_RTX_SECTION (enum
          machine_mode MODE, rtx X, unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT ALIGN)
     Return the section into which a constant X, of mode MODE, should be
     placed.  You can assume that X is some kind of constant in RTL.
     The argument MODE is redundant except in the case of a 'const_int'
     rtx.  ALIGN is the constant alignment in bits.

     The default version of this function takes care of putting symbolic
     constants in 'flag_pic' mode in 'data_section' and everything else
     in 'readonly_data_section'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MANGLE_DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME (tree DECL, tree
          ID)
     Define this hook if you need to postprocess the assembler name
     generated by target-independent code.  The ID provided to this hook
     will be the computed name (e.g., the macro 'DECL_NAME' of the DECL
     in C, or the mangled name of the DECL in C++).  The return value of
     the hook is an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' for the appropriate mangled name
     on your target system.  The default implementation of this hook
     just returns the ID provided.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (tree DECL, rtx RTL,
          int NEW_DECL_P)
     Define this hook if references to a symbol or a constant must be
     treated differently depending on something about the variable or
     function named by the symbol (such as what section it is in).

     The hook is executed immediately after rtl has been created for
     DECL, which may be a variable or function declaration or an entry
     in the constant pool.  In either case, RTL is the rtl in question.
     Do _not_ use 'DECL_RTL (DECL)' in this hook; that field may not
     have been initialized yet.

     In the case of a constant, it is safe to assume that the rtl is a
     'mem' whose address is a 'symbol_ref'.  Most decls will also have
     this form, but that is not guaranteed.  Global register variables,
     for instance, will have a 'reg' for their rtl.  (Normally the right
     thing to do with such unusual rtl is leave it alone.)

     The NEW_DECL_P argument will be true if this is the first time that
     'TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' has been invoked on this decl.  It
     will be false for subsequent invocations, which will happen for
     duplicate declarations.  Whether or not anything must be done for
     the duplicate declaration depends on whether the hook examines
     'DECL_ATTRIBUTES'.  NEW_DECL_P is always true when the hook is
     called for a constant.

     The usual thing for this hook to do is to record flags in the
     'symbol_ref', using 'SYMBOL_REF_FLAG' or 'SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.
     Historically, the name string was modified if it was necessary to
     encode more than one bit of information, but this practice is now
     discouraged; use 'SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.

     The default definition of this hook, 'default_encode_section_info'
     in 'varasm.c', sets a number of commonly-useful bits in
     'SYMBOL_REF_FLAGS'.  Check whether the default does what you need
     before overriding it.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (const char
          *NAME)
     Decode NAME and return the real name part, sans the characters that
     'TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' may have added.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_IN_SMALL_DATA_P (const_tree EXP)
     Returns true if EXP should be placed into a "small data" section.
     The default version of this hook always returns false.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_SRODATA_SECTION
     Contains the value true if the target places read-only "small data"
     into a separate section.  The default value is false.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE (void)
     It returns true if target wants profile code emitted before
     prologue.

     The default version of this hook use the target macro
     'PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_BINDS_LOCAL_P (const_tree EXP)
     Returns true if EXP names an object for which name resolution rules
     must resolve to the current "module" (dynamic shared library or
     executable image).

     The default version of this hook implements the name resolution
     rules for ELF, which has a looser model of global name binding than
     other currently supported object file formats.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_TLS
     Contains the value true if the target supports thread-local
     storage.  The default value is false.

17.20 Position Independent Code
===============================

This section describes macros that help implement generation of position
independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough to
generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the hook
'TARGET_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P' and to the macro 'PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS',
as well as 'LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS'.  You must modify the definition of
'movsi' to do something appropriate when the source operand contains a
symbolic address.  You may also need to alter the handling of switch
statements so that they use relative addresses.

 -- Macro: PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM
     The register number of the register used to address a table of
     static data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is
     defined by a processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).
     When this macro is defined, RTL is generated for this register
     once, as with the stack pointer and frame pointer registers.  If
     this macro is not defined, it is up to the machine-dependent files
     to allocate such a register (if necessary).  Note that this
     register must be fixed when in use (e.g. when 'flag_pic' is true).

 -- Macro: PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED
     A C expression that is nonzero if the register defined by
     'PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is clobbered by calls.  If not defined,
     the default is zero.  Do not define this macro if
     'PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is not defined.

 -- Macro: LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (X)
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate immediate
     operand on the target machine when generating position independent
     code.  You can assume that X satisfies 'CONSTANT_P', so you need
     not check this.  You can also assume FLAG_PIC is true, so you need
     not check it either.  You need not define this macro if all
     constants (including 'SYMBOL_REF') can be immediate operands when
     generating position independent code.

17.21.1 The Overall Framework of an Assembler File
--------------------------------------------------

This describes the overall framework of an assembly file.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FILE_START (void)
     Output to 'asm_out_file' any text which the assembler expects to
     find at the beginning of a file.  The default behavior is
     controlled by two flags, documented below.  Unless your target's
     assembler is quite unusual, if you override the default, you should
     call 'default_file_start' at some point in your target hook.  This
     lets other target files rely on these variables.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_FILE_START_APP_OFF
     If this flag is true, the text of the macro 'ASM_APP_OFF' will be
     printed as the very first line in the assembly file, unless
     '-fverbose-asm' is in effect.  (If that macro has been defined to
     the empty string, this variable has no effect.)  With the normal
     definition of 'ASM_APP_OFF', the effect is to notify the GNU
     assembler that it need not bother stripping comments or extra
     whitespace from its input.  This allows it to work a bit faster.

     The default is false.  You should not set it to true unless you
     have verified that your port does not generate any extra whitespace
     or comments that will cause GAS to issue errors in NO_APP mode.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_FILE_START_FILE_DIRECTIVE
     If this flag is true, 'output_file_directive' will be called for
     the primary source file, immediately after printing 'ASM_APP_OFF'
     (if that is enabled).  Most ELF assemblers expect this to be done.
     The default is false.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FILE_END (void)
     Output to 'asm_out_file' any text which the assembler expects to
     find at the end of a file.  The default is to output nothing.

 -- Function: void file_end_indicate_exec_stack ()
     Some systems use a common convention, the '.note.GNU-stack' special
     section, to indicate whether or not an object file relies on the
     stack being executable.  If your system uses this convention, you
     should define 'TARGET_ASM_FILE_END' to this function.  If you need
     to do other things in that hook, have your hook function call this
     function.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_LTO_START (void)
     Output to 'asm_out_file' any text which the assembler expects to
     find at the start of an LTO section.  The default is to output
     nothing.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_LTO_END (void)
     Output to 'asm_out_file' any text which the assembler expects to
     find at the end of an LTO section.  The default is to output
     nothing.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_CODE_END (void)
     Output to 'asm_out_file' any text which is needed before emitting
     unwind info and debug info at the end of a file.  Some targets emit
     here PIC setup thunks that cannot be emitted at the end of file,
     because they couldn't have unwind info then.  The default is to
     output nothing.

 -- Macro: ASM_COMMENT_START
     A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
     assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will end
     at the end of the line.

 -- Macro: ASM_APP_ON
     A C string constant for text to be output before each 'asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is '"#APP"',
     which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers but tells
     the GNU assembler that it must check the lines that follow for all
     valid assembler constructs.

 -- Macro: ASM_APP_OFF
     A C string constant for text to be output after each 'asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     '"#NO_APP"', which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
     time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler
     output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging
     information which indicates that filename NAME is the current
     source file to the stdio stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     the file format in use is appropriate.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (FILE *FILE,
          const char *NAME)
     Output COFF information or DWARF debugging information which
     indicates that filename NAME is the current source file to the
     stdio stream FILE.

     This target hook need not be defined if the standard form of output
     for the file format in use is appropriate.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (const char *NAME)
     Output a string based on NAME, suitable for the '#ident' directive,
     or the equivalent directive or pragma in non-C-family languages.
     If this hook is not defined, nothing is output for the '#ident'
     directive.

 -- Macro: OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (STREAM, STRING)
     A C statement to output the string STRING to the stdio stream
     STREAM.  If you do not call the function 'output_quoted_string' in
     your config files, GCC will only call it to output filenames to the
     assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format of
     the filename using this macro.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION (const char *NAME,
          unsigned int FLAGS, tree DECL)
     Output assembly directives to switch to section NAME.  The section
     should have attributes as specified by FLAGS, which is a bit mask
     of the 'SECTION_*' flags defined in 'output.h'.  If DECL is
     non-NULL, it is the 'VAR_DECL' or 'FUNCTION_DECL' with which this
     section is associated.

 -- Target Hook: section * TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_SECTION (tree DECL, enum
          node_frequency FREQ, bool STARTUP, bool EXIT)
     Return preferred text (sub)section for function DECL.  Main purpose
     of this function is to separate cold, normal and hot functions.
     STARTUP is true when function is known to be used only at startup
     (from static constructors or it is 'main()').  EXIT is true when
     function is known to be used only at exit (from static
     destructors).  Return NULL if function should go to default text
     section.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_SWITCHED_TEXT_SECTIONS (FILE
          *FILE, tree DECL, bool NEW_IS_COLD)
     Used by the target to emit any assembler directives or additional
     labels needed when a function is partitioned between different
     sections.  Output should be written to FILE.  The function decl is
     available as DECL and the new section is 'cold' if NEW_IS_COLD is
     'true'.

 -- Common Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_NAMED_SECTIONS
     This flag is true if the target supports
     'TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION'.  It must not be modified by
     command-line option processing.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_SWITCHABLE_BSS_SECTIONS
     This flag is true if we can create zeroed data by switching to a
     BSS section and then using 'ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP' to allocate the space.
     This is true on most ELF targets.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_SECTION_TYPE_FLAGS (tree DECL,
          const char *NAME, int RELOC)
     Choose a set of section attributes for use by
     'TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' based on a variable or function decl, a
     section name, and whether or not the declaration's initializer may
     contain runtime relocations.  DECL may be null, in which case
     read-write data should be assumed.

     The default version of this function handles choosing code vs data,
     read-only vs read-write data, and 'flag_pic'.  You should only need
     to override this if your target has special flags that might be set
     via '__attribute__'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ASM_RECORD_GCC_SWITCHES (print_switch_type
          TYPE, const char *TEXT)
     Provides the target with the ability to record the gcc command line
     switches that have been passed to the compiler, and options that
     are enabled.  The TYPE argument specifies what is being recorded.
     It can take the following values:

     'SWITCH_TYPE_PASSED'
          TEXT is a command line switch that has been set by the user.

     'SWITCH_TYPE_ENABLED'
          TEXT is an option which has been enabled.  This might be as a
          direct result of a command line switch, or because it is
          enabled by default or because it has been enabled as a side
          effect of a different command line switch.  For example, the
          '-O2' switch enables various different individual optimization
          passes.

     'SWITCH_TYPE_DESCRIPTIVE'
          TEXT is either NULL or some descriptive text which should be
          ignored.  If TEXT is NULL then it is being used to warn the
          target hook that either recording is starting or ending.  The
          first time TYPE is SWITCH_TYPE_DESCRIPTIVE and TEXT is NULL,
          the warning is for start up and the second time the warning is
          for wind down.  This feature is to allow the target hook to
          make any necessary preparations before it starts to record
          switches and to perform any necessary tidying up after it has
          finished recording switches.

     'SWITCH_TYPE_LINE_START'
          This option can be ignored by this target hook.

     'SWITCH_TYPE_LINE_END'
          This option can be ignored by this target hook.

     The hook's return value must be zero.  Other return values may be
     supported in the future.

     By default this hook is set to NULL, but an example implementation
     is provided for ELF based targets.  Called ELF_RECORD_GCC_SWITCHES,
     it records the switches as ASCII text inside a new, string
     mergeable section in the assembler output file.  The name of the
     new section is provided by the
     'TARGET_ASM_RECORD_GCC_SWITCHES_SECTION' target hook.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_RECORD_GCC_SWITCHES_SECTION
     This is the name of the section that will be created by the example
     ELF implementation of the 'TARGET_ASM_RECORD_GCC_SWITCHES' target
     hook.

17.21.2 Output of Data
----------------------

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_BYTE_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_HI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_SI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_DI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_TI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_HI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_SI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_DI_OP
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_UNALIGNED_TI_OP
     These hooks specify assembly directives for creating certain kinds
     of integer object.  The 'TARGET_ASM_BYTE_OP' directive creates a
     byte-sized object, the 'TARGET_ASM_ALIGNED_HI_OP' one creates an
     aligned two-byte object, and so on.  Any of the hooks may be
     'NULL', indicating that no suitable directive is available.

     The compiler will print these strings at the start of a new line,
     followed immediately by the object's initial value.  In most cases,
     the string should contain a tab, a pseudo-op, and then another tab.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_INTEGER (rtx X, unsigned int SIZE, int
          ALIGNED_P)
     The 'assemble_integer' function uses this hook to output an integer
     object.  X is the object's value, SIZE is its size in bytes and
     ALIGNED_P indicates whether it is aligned.  The function should
     return 'true' if it was able to output the object.  If it returns
     false, 'assemble_integer' will try to split the object into smaller
     parts.

     The default implementation of this hook will use the
     'TARGET_ASM_BYTE_OP' family of strings, returning 'false' when the
     relevant string is 'NULL'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_CONST_EXTRA (FILE *FILE,
          rtx X)
     A target hook to recognize RTX patterns that 'output_addr_const'
     can't deal with, and output assembly code to FILE corresponding to
     the pattern X.  This may be used to allow machine-dependent
     'UNSPEC's to appear within constants.

     If target hook fails to recognize a pattern, it must return
     'false', so that a standard error message is printed.  If it prints
     an error message itself, by calling, for example,
     'output_operand_lossage', it may just return 'true'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes
     at PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type 'char *' and LEN a C
     expression of type 'int'.

     If the assembler has a '.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
     Unix assembler, do not define the macro 'ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_FDESC (STREAM, DECL, N)
     A C statement to output word N of a function descriptor for DECL.
     This must be defined if 'TARGET_VTABLE_USES_DESCRIPTORS' is
     defined, and is otherwise unused.

 -- Macro: CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION
     You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
     expression to have a nonzero value if GCC should output the
     constant pool for a function before the code for the function, or a
     zero value if GCC should output the constant pool after the
     function.  If you do not define this macro, the usual case, GCC
     will output the constant pool before the function.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (FILE, FUNNAME, FUNDECL, SIZE)
     A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of
     the constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the
     name of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, it can be obtained via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that will be written immediately after
     this call.

     If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro
     need not be defined.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN, LABELNO,
          JUMPTO)
     A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
     the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro need
     not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output normally.)

     The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
     assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
     output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a 'const_int').
     ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should output
     an assembler directive to force this much alignment.

     The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
     the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
     responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
     place.  Here is how to do this:

          (*targetm.asm_out.internal_label) (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);

     When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
     'goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
     from being output a second time in the usual manner.

     You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)
     A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the
     constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the name
     of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, you can obtain it via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that GCC wrote immediately before this
     call.

     If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need
     not define this macro.

 -- Macro: IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (C, STR)
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if C is used
     as a logical line separator by the assembler.  STR points to the
     position in the string where C was found; this can be used if a
     line separator uses multiple characters.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is that only the
     character ';' is treated as a logical line separator.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_OPEN_PAREN
 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_ASM_CLOSE_PAREN
     These target hooks are C string constants, describing the syntax in
     the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  If not
     overridden, they default to normal parentheses, which is correct
     for most assemblers.

 These macros are provided by 'real.h' for writing the definitions of
'ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE' and the like:

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DECIMAL32 (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DECIMAL64 (X, L)
 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DECIMAL128 (X, L)
     These translate X, of type 'REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to the target's
     floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the
     variable L.  For 'REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE' and
     'REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DECIMAL32', this variable should be a simple
     'long int'.  For the others, it should be an array of 'long int'.
     The number of elements in this array is determined by the size of
     the desired target floating point data type: 32 bits of it go in
     each 'long int' array element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of
     the result, even if 'long int' is wider than 32 bits on the host
     machine.

     The array element values are designed so that you can print them
     out using 'fprintf' in the order they should appear in the target
     machine's memory.

17.21.3 Output of Uninitialized Variables
-----------------------------------------

Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
outputting a single uninitialized variable.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose size is
     SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up to
     whatever alignment the caller wants.  It is possible that SIZE may
     be zero, for instance if a struct with no other member than a
     zero-length array is defined.  In this case, the backend must
     output a symbol definition that allocates at least one byte, both
     so that the address of the resulting object does not compare equal
     to any other, and because some object formats cannot even express
     the concept of a zero-sized common symbol, as that is how they
     represent an ordinary undefined external.

     Use the expression 'assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     common global variables are output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     Like 'ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of 'ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE,
          ALIGNMENT)
     Like 'ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' except that DECL of the variable
     to be output, if there is one, or 'NULL_TREE' if there is no
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GCC will use it
     in place of both 'ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' and
     'ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON'.  Define this macro when you need to
     see the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of uninitialized global DECL named NAME
     whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ALIGNMENT is the alignment
     specified as the number of bits.

     Try to use function 'asm_output_aligned_bss' defined in file
     'varasm.c' when defining this macro.  If unable, use the expression
     'assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before
     and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for defining
     the name, and a newline.

     There are two ways of handling global BSS.  One is to define this
     macro.  The other is to have 'TARGET_ASM_SELECT_SECTION' return a
     switchable BSS section (*note
     TARGET_HAVE_SWITCHABLE_BSS_SECTIONS::).  You do not need to do
     both.

     Some languages do not have 'common' data, and require a non-common
     form of global BSS in order to handle uninitialized globals
     efficiently.  C++ is one example of this.  However, if the target
     does not support global BSS, the front end may choose to make
     globals common in order to save space in the object file.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME whose
     size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up to
     whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression 'assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     static variables are output.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)
     Like 'ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of 'ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_LOCAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE,
          ALIGNMENT)
     Like 'ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL' except that DECL of the variable to
     be output, if there is one, or 'NULL_TREE' if there is no
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GCC will use it
     in place of both 'ASM_OUTPUT_DECL' and 'ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL'.
     Define this macro when you need to see the variable's decl in order
     to chose what to output.

17.21.4 Output and Generation of Labels
---------------------------------------

This is about outputting labels.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the expression
     'assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before
     and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for defining
     the name, and a newline.  A default definition of this macro is
     provided which is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_LABEL (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a label named NAME of a function.  Use
     the expression 'assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name
     itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.  A default definition
     of this macro is provided which is correct for most systems.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of 'ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)
     Identical to 'ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL', except that NAME is known to refer
     to a compiler-generated label.  The default definition uses
     'assemble_name_raw', which is like 'assemble_name' except that it
     is more efficient.

 -- Macro: SIZE_ASM_OP
     A C string containing the appropriate assembler directive to
     specify the size of a symbol, without any arguments.  On systems
     that use ELF, the default (in 'config/elfos.h') is '"\t.size\t"';
     on other systems, the default is not to define this macro.

     Define this macro only if it is correct to use the default
     definitions of 'ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE' and
     'ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' for your system.  If you need your own
     custom definitions of those macros, or if you do not need explicit
     symbol sizes at all, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE (STREAM, NAME, SIZE)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     a directive telling the assembler that the size of the symbol NAME
     is SIZE.  SIZE is a 'HOST_WIDE_INT'.  If you define 'SIZE_ASM_OP',
     a default definition of this macro is provided.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     a directive telling the assembler to calculate the size of the
     symbol NAME by subtracting its address from the current address.

     If you define 'SIZE_ASM_OP', a default definition of this macro is
     provided.  The default assumes that the assembler recognizes a
     special '.' symbol as referring to the current address, and can
     calculate the difference between this and another symbol.  If your
     assembler does not recognize '.' or cannot do calculations with it,
     you will need to redefine 'ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' to use some
     other technique.

 -- Macro: NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     '$' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
     have '$' in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined, '.' is used
     instead.

 -- Macro: NO_DOT_IN_LABEL
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     '.' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
     have names that use '.'.  If this macro is defined, these names are
     rewritten to avoid '.'.

 -- Macro: TYPE_ASM_OP
     A C string containing the appropriate assembler directive to
     specify the type of a symbol, without any arguments.  On systems
     that use ELF, the default (in 'config/elfos.h') is '"\t.type\t"';
     on other systems, the default is not to define this macro.

     Define this macro only if it is correct to use the default
     definition of 'ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' for your system.  If you
     need your own custom definition of this macro, or if you do not
     need explicit symbol types at all, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: TYPE_OPERAND_FMT
     A C string which specifies (using 'printf' syntax) the format of
     the second operand to 'TYPE_ASM_OP'.  On systems that use ELF, the
     default (in 'config/elfos.h') is '"@%s"'; on other systems, the
     default is not to define this macro.

     Define this macro only if it is correct to use the default
     definition of 'ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' for your system.  If you
     need your own custom definition of this macro, or if you do not
     need explicit symbol types at all, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE (STREAM, TYPE)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     a directive telling the assembler that the type of the symbol NAME
     is TYPE.  TYPE is a C string; currently, that string is always
     either '"function"' or '"object"', but you should not count on
     this.

     If you define 'TYPE_ASM_OP' and 'TYPE_OPERAND_FMT', a default
     definition of this macro is provided.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a function which
     is being defined.  This macro is responsible for outputting the
     label definition (perhaps using 'ASM_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_LABEL').  The
     argument DECL is the 'FUNCTION_DECL' tree node representing the
     function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of
     'ASM_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_LABEL').

     You may wish to use 'ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' in the definition
     of this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for declaring the size of a function which is
     being defined.  The argument NAME is the name of the function.  The
     argument DECL is the 'FUNCTION_DECL' tree node representing the
     function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not
     defined.

     You may wish to use 'ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' in the definition of
     this macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of an initialized
     variable which is being defined.  This macro must output the label
     definition (perhaps using 'ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument DECL
     is the 'VAR_DECL' tree node representing the variable.

     If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of 'ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

     You may wish to use 'ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' and/or
     'ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE' in the definition of this macro.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_DECLARE_CONSTANT_NAME (FILE *FILE,
          const char *NAME, const_tree EXPR, HOST_WIDE_INT SIZE)
     A target hook to output to the stdio stream FILE any text necessary
     for declaring the name NAME of a constant which is being defined.
     This target hook is responsible for outputting the label definition
     (perhaps using 'assemble_label').  The argument EXP is the value of
     the constant, and SIZE is the size of the constant in bytes.  The
     NAME will be an internal label.

     The default version of this target hook, define the NAME in the
     usual manner as a label (by means of 'assemble_label').

     You may wish to use 'ASM_OUTPUT_TYPE_DIRECTIVE' in this target
     hook.

 -- Macro: ASM_DECLARE_REGISTER_GLOBAL (STREAM, DECL, REGNO, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for claiming a register REGNO for a global
     variable DECL with name NAME.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

 -- Macro: ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (STREAM, DECL, TOPLEVEL, ATEND)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable
     name once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and thus
     has had a chance to determine the size of an array when controlled
     by an initializer.  This is used on systems where it's necessary to
     declare something about the size of the object.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

     You may wish to use 'ASM_OUTPUT_SIZE_DIRECTIVE' and/or
     'ASM_OUTPUT_MEASURED_SIZE' in the definition of this macro.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (FILE *STREAM, const
          char *NAME)
     This target hook is a function to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     some commands that will make the label NAME global; that is,
     available for reference from other files.

     The default implementation relies on a proper definition of
     'GLOBAL_ASM_OP'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_GLOBALIZE_DECL_NAME (FILE *STREAM, tree
          DECL)
     This target hook is a function to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     some commands that will make the name associated with DECL global;
     that is, available for reference from other files.

     The default implementation uses the TARGET_ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL
     target hook.

 -- Macro: ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     some commands that will make the label NAME weak; that is,
     available for reference from other files but only used if no other
     definition is available.  Use the expression 'assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for making that name weak,
     and a newline.

     If you don't define this macro or 'ASM_WEAKEN_DECL', GCC will not
     support weak symbols and you should not define the 'SUPPORTS_WEAK'
     macro.

 -- Macro: ASM_WEAKEN_DECL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, VALUE)
     Combines (and replaces) the function of 'ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' and
     'ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS', allowing access to the associated function
     or variable decl.  If VALUE is not 'NULL', this C statement should
     output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code which defines
     (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.  If VALUE
     is 'NULL', it should output commands to make NAME weak.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_WEAKREF (STREAM, DECL, NAME, VALUE)
     Outputs a directive that enables NAME to be used to refer to symbol
     VALUE with weak-symbol semantics.  'decl' is the declaration of
     'name'.

 -- Macro: SUPPORTS_WEAK
     A preprocessor constant expression which evaluates to true if the
     target supports weak symbols.

     If you don't define this macro, 'defaults.h' provides a default
     definition.  If either 'ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' or 'ASM_WEAKEN_DECL' is
     defined, the default definition is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_SUPPORTS_WEAK
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak
     symbols.

     If you don't define this macro, 'defaults.h' provides a default
     definition.  The default definition is '(SUPPORTS_WEAK)'.  Define
     this macro if you want to control weak symbol support with a
     compiler flag such as '-melf'.

 -- Macro: MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY (DECL)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark DECL to be emitted as a
     public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units
     will be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object
     file format provides support for this concept, such as the 'COMDAT'
     section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this
     support requires changes to DECL, such as putting it in a separate
     section.

 -- Macro: SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports
     one-only semantics.

     If you don't define this macro, 'varasm.c' provides a default
     definition.  If 'MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY' is defined, the default
     definition is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'.  Define this macro if you
     want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
     setting the 'DECL_ONE_ONLY' flag is enough to mark a declaration to
     be emitted as one-only.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_ASSEMBLE_VISIBILITY (tree DECL, int
          VISIBILITY)
     This target hook is a function to output to ASM_OUT_FILE some
     commands that will make the symbol(s) associated with DECL have
     hidden, protected or internal visibility as specified by
     VISIBILITY.

 -- Macro: TARGET_WEAK_NOT_IN_ARCHIVE_TOC
     A C expression that evaluates to true if the target's linker
     expects that weak symbols do not appear in a static archive's table
     of contents.  The default is '0'.

     Leaving weak symbols out of an archive's table of contents means
     that, if a symbol will only have a definition in one translation
     unit and will have undefined references from other translation
     units, that symbol should not be weak.  Defining this macro to be
     nonzero will thus have the effect that certain symbols that would
     normally be weak (explicit template instantiations, and vtables for
     polymorphic classes with noninline key methods) will instead be
     nonweak.

     The C++ ABI requires this macro to be zero.  Define this macro for
     targets where full C++ ABI compliance is impossible and where
     linker restrictions require weak symbols to be left out of a static
     archive's table of contents.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for declaring the name of an external symbol
     named NAME which is referenced in this compilation but not defined.
     The value of DECL is the tree node for the declaration.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't require
     anything.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (rtx SYMREF)
     This target hook is a function to output to ASM_OUT_FILE an
     assembler pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.
     The name of the library function is given by SYMREF, which is a
     'symbol_ref'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_MARK_DECL_PRESERVED (const char
          *SYMBOL)
     This target hook is a function to output to ASM_OUT_FILE an
     assembler directive to annotate SYMBOL as used.  The Darwin target
     uses the .no_dead_code_strip directive.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     a reference in assembler syntax to a label named NAME.  This should
     add '_' to the front of the name, if that is customary on your
     operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.  This
     macro is used in 'assemble_name'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MANGLE_ASSEMBLER_NAME (const char *NAME)
     Given a symbol NAME, perform same mangling as 'varasm.c''s
     'assemble_name', but in memory rather than to a file stream,
     returning result as an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  Required for correct LTO
     symtabs.  The default implementation calls the
     'TARGET_STRIP_NAME_ENCODING' hook and then prepends the
     'USER_LABEL_PREFIX', if any.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SYMBOL_REF (STREAM, SYM)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output a reference to
     'SYMBOL_REF' SYM.  If not defined, 'assemble_name' will be used to
     output the name of the symbol.  This macro may be used to modify
     the way a symbol is referenced depending on information encoded by
     'TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL_REF (STREAM, BUF)
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output a reference to BUF, the
     result of 'ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL'.  If not defined,
     'assemble_name' will be used to output the name of the symbol.
     This macro is not used by 'output_asm_label', or the '%l' specifier
     that calls it; the intention is that this macro should be set when
     it is necessary to output a label differently when its address is
     being taken.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE *STREAM, const
          char *PREFIX, unsigned long LABELNO)
     A function to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number LABELNO.

     It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the
     labels used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise,
     certain programs will have name conflicts with internal labels.

     It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table of
     the object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for
     labels that should be excluded; on many systems, the letter 'L' at
     the beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
     convention your system uses, and follow it.

     The default version of this function utilizes
     'ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DEBUG_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a debug info
     label whose name is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.
     This is useful for VLIW targets, where debug info labels may need
     to be treated differently than branch target labels.  On some
     systems, branch target labels must be at the beginning of
     instruction bundles, but debug info labels can occur in the middle
     of instruction bundles.

     If this macro is not defined, then
     '(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)' will be used.

 -- Macro: ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (STRING, PREFIX, NUM)
     A C statement to store into the string STRING a label whose name is
     made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     This string, when output subsequently by 'assemble_name', should
     produce the output that '(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)' would
     produce with the same PREFIX and NUM.

     If the string begins with '*', then 'assemble_name' will output the
     rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
     'ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' to use '*' in this way.  If the
     string doesn't start with '*', then 'ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' gets to
     output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
     'ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' is also part of your machine description, so
     you should know what it does on your machine.)

 -- Macro: ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)
     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type
     'char *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and
     the number NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use
     'alloca' to get space for the string.

     The string will be used as an argument to 'ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
     name is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in
     valid assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time
     this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
     similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.

     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent
     any conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow
     periods or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least one
     of these between the name and the number will suffice.

     If this macro is not defined, a default definition will be provided
     which is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.

     If 'SET_ASM_OP' is defined, a default definition is provided which
     is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DEF_FROM_DECLS (STREAM, DECL_OF_NAME,
          DECL_OF_VALUE)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol whose tree node is DECL_OF_NAME
     to have the value of the tree node DECL_OF_VALUE.  This macro will
     be used in preference to 'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' if it is defined and if
     the tree nodes are available.

     If 'SET_ASM_OP' is defined, a default definition is provided which
     is correct for most systems.

 -- Macro: TARGET_DEFERRED_OUTPUT_DEFS (DECL_OF_NAME, DECL_OF_VALUE)
     A C statement that evaluates to true if the assembler code which
     defines (equates) the symbol whose tree node is DECL_OF_NAME to
     have the value of the tree node DECL_OF_VALUE should be emitted
     near the end of the current compilation unit.  The default is to
     not defer output of defines.  This macro affects defines output by
     'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' and 'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF_FROM_DECLS'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value
     VALUE.  If VALUE is 'NULL', it defines NAME as an undefined weak
     symbol.

     Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
     'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF' instead if possible.

 -- Macro: OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (BUF, IS_INST, CLASS_NAME, CAT_NAME,
          SEL_NAME)
     Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
     Objective-C methods.

     The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of
     the class (e.g. '_1_Foo').  For methods in categories, the name of
     the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
     '_1_Foo_Bar').

     These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult
     since the method's selector is not present in the name.  Therefore,
     particular systems define other ways of computing names.

     BUF is an expression of type 'char *' which gives you a buffer in
     which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
     CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.

     The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
     method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
     CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or 'NULL' if the method is
     not in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.

     On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can use
     this macro to provide more human-readable names.

17.21.5 How Initialization Functions Are Handled
------------------------------------------------

The compiled code for certain languages includes "constructors" (also
called "initialization routines")--functions to initialize data in the
program when the program is started.  These functions need to be called
before the program is "started"--that is to say, before 'main' is
called.

 Compiling some languages generates "destructors" (also called
"termination routines") that should be called when the program
terminates.

 To make the initialization and termination functions work, the compiler
must output something in the assembler code to cause those functions to
be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the compiler to a new
system, you need to specify how to do this.

 There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants.
Much of the structure is common to all four variations.

 The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
initialization functions, called '__CTOR_LIST__', and a list of
termination functions, called '__DTOR_LIST__'.

 Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may
hold 0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
pointer containing zero.

 Depending on the operating system and its executable file format,
either 'crtstuff.c' or 'libgcc2.c' traverses these lists at startup time
and exit time.  Constructors are called in reverse order of the list;
destructors in forward order.

 The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors.
Traditionally these are called '.ctors' and '.dtors'.  Each object file
that defines an initialization function also puts a word in the
constructor section to point to that function.  The linker accumulates
all these words into one contiguous '.ctors' section.  Termination
functions are handled similarly.

 This method will be chosen as the default by 'target-def.h' if
'TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' is defined.  A target that does not support
arbitrary sections, but does support special designated constructor and
destructor sections may define 'CTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP' and
'DTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP' to achieve the same effect.

 When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants,
depending upon how the code in 'crtstuff.c' is called.  On systems that
support a ".init" section which is executed at program startup, parts of
'crtstuff.c' are compiled into that section.  The program is linked by
the 'gcc' driver like this:

     ld -o OUTPUT_FILE crti.o crtbegin.o ... -lgcc crtend.o crtn.o

 The prologue of a function ('__init') appears in the '.init' section of
'crti.o'; the epilogue appears in 'crtn.o'.  Likewise for the function
'__fini' in the ".fini" section.  Normally these files are provided by
the operating system or by the GNU C library, but are provided by GCC
for a few targets.

 The objects 'crtbegin.o' and 'crtend.o' are (for most targets) compiled
from 'crtstuff.c'.  They contain, among other things, code fragments
within the '.init' and '.fini' sections that branch to routines in the
'.text' section.  The linker will pull all parts of a section together,
which results in a complete '__init' function that invokes the routines
we need at startup.

 To use this variant, you must define the 'INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' macro
properly.

 If no init section is available, when GCC compiles any function called
'main' (or more accurately, any function designated as a program entry
point by the language front end calling 'expand_main_function'), it
inserts a procedure call to '__main' as the first executable code after
the function prologue.  The '__main' function is defined in 'libgcc2.c'
and runs the global constructors.

 In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are again
two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU 'ld') and an
'a.out' format must be used.  In this case, 'TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR' is
defined to produce a '.stabs' entry of type 'N_SETT', referencing the
name '__CTOR_LIST__', and with the address of the void function
containing the initialization code as its value.  The GNU linker
recognizes this as a request to add the value to a "set"; the values are
accumulated, and are eventually placed in the executable as a vector in
the format described above, with a leading (ignored) count and a
trailing zero element.  'TARGET_ASM_DESTRUCTOR' is handled similarly.
Since no init section is available, the absence of 'INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
causes the compilation of 'main' to call '__main' as above, starting the
initialization process.

 The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker.
This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as 'ECOFF'.  In
this case, 'TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS' is false, initialization and
termination functions are recognized simply by their names.  This
requires an extra program in the linkage step, called 'collect2'.  This
program pretends to be the linker, for use with GCC; it does its job by
running the ordinary linker, but also arranges to include the vectors of
initialization and termination functions.  These functions are called
via '__main' as described above.  In order to use this method,
'use_collect2' must be defined in the target in 'config.gcc'.

 The following section describes the specific macros that control and
customize the handling of initialization and termination functions.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Macros for Initialization,  Next: Instruction Output,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Assembler Format

17.21.6 Macros Controlling Initialization Routines
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles initialization
and termination functions:

 -- Macro: INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP
     If defined, a C string constant, including spacing, for the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     initialization code.  If not defined, GCC will assume such a
     section does not exist.  When you are using special sections for
     initialization and termination functions, this macro also controls
     how 'crtstuff.c' and 'libgcc2.c' arrange to run the initialization
     functions.

 -- Macro: HAS_INIT_SECTION
     If defined, 'main' will not call '__main' as described above.  This
     macro should be defined for systems that control start-up code on a
     symbol-by-symbol basis, such as OSF/1, and should not be defined
     explicitly for systems that support 'INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.

 -- Macro: LD_INIT_SWITCH
     If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker
     that the following symbol is an initialization routine.

 -- Macro: LD_FINI_SWITCH
     If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker
     that the following symbol is a finalization routine.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_SHARED_INIT_FUNC (STREAM, FUNC)
     If defined, a C statement that will write a function that can be
     automatically called when a shared library is loaded.  The function
     should call FUNC, which takes no arguments.  If not defined, and
     the object format requires an explicit initialization function,
     then a function called '_GLOBAL__DI' will be generated.

     This function and the following one are used by collect2 when
     linking a shared library that needs constructors or destructors, or
     has DWARF2 exception tables embedded in the code.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_SHARED_FINI_FUNC (STREAM, FUNC)
     If defined, a C statement that will write a function that can be
     automatically called when a shared library is unloaded.  The
     function should call FUNC, which takes no arguments.  If not
     defined, and the object format requires an explicit finalization
     function, then a function called '_GLOBAL__DD' will be generated.

 -- Macro: INVOKE__main
     If defined, 'main' will call '__main' despite the presence of
     'INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  This macro should be defined for systems
     where the init section is not actually run automatically, but is
     still useful for collecting the lists of constructors and
     destructors.

 -- Macro: SUPPORTS_INIT_PRIORITY
     If nonzero, the C++ 'init_priority' attribute is supported and the
     compiler should emit instructions to control the order of
     initialization of objects.  If zero, the compiler will issue an
     error message upon encountering an 'init_priority' attribute.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS
     This value is true if the target supports some "native" method of
     collecting constructors and destructors to be run at startup and
     exit.  It is false if we must use 'collect2'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR (rtx SYMBOL, int PRIORITY)
     If defined, a function that outputs assembler code to arrange to
     call the function referenced by SYMBOL at initialization time.

     Assume that SYMBOL is a 'SYMBOL_REF' for a function taking no
     arguments and with no return value.  If the target supports
     initialization priorities, PRIORITY is a value between 0 and
     'MAX_INIT_PRIORITY'; otherwise it must be 'DEFAULT_INIT_PRIORITY'.

     If this macro is not defined by the target, a suitable default will
     be chosen if (1) the target supports arbitrary section names, (2)
     the target defines 'CTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP', or (3) 'USE_COLLECT2' is
     not defined.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_DESTRUCTOR (rtx SYMBOL, int PRIORITY)
     This is like 'TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR' but used for termination
     functions rather than initialization functions.

 If 'TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS' is true, the initialization routine
generated for the generated object file will have static linkage.

 If your system uses 'collect2' as the means of processing constructors,
then that program normally uses 'nm' to scan an object file for
constructor functions to be called.

 On certain kinds of systems, you can define this macro to make
'collect2' work faster (and, in some cases, make it work at all):

 -- Macro: OBJECT_FORMAT_COFF
     Define this macro if the system uses COFF (Common Object File
     Format) object files, so that 'collect2' can assume this format and
     scan object files directly for dynamic constructor/destructor
     functions.

     This macro is effective only in a native compiler; 'collect2' as
     part of a cross compiler always uses 'nm' for the target machine.

 -- Macro: REAL_NM_FILE_NAME
     Define this macro as a C string constant containing the file name
     to use to execute 'nm'.  The default is to search the path normally
     for 'nm'.

 -- Macro: NM_FLAGS
     'collect2' calls 'nm' to scan object files for static constructors
     and destructors and LTO info.  By default, '-n' is passed.  Define
     'NM_FLAGS' to a C string constant if other options are needed to
     get the same output format as GNU 'nm -n' produces.

 If your system supports shared libraries and has a program to list the
dynamic dependencies of a given library or executable, you can define
these macros to enable support for running initialization and
termination functions in shared libraries:

 -- Macro: LDD_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to a C string constant containing the name of the
     program which lists dynamic dependencies, like 'ldd' under SunOS 4.

 -- Macro: PARSE_LDD_OUTPUT (PTR)
     Define this macro to be C code that extracts filenames from the
     output of the program denoted by 'LDD_SUFFIX'.  PTR is a variable
     of type 'char *' that points to the beginning of a line of output
     from 'LDD_SUFFIX'.  If the line lists a dynamic dependency, the
     code must advance PTR to the beginning of the filename on that
     line.  Otherwise, it must set PTR to 'NULL'.

 -- Macro: SHLIB_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to a C string constant containing the default
     shared library extension of the target (e.g., '".so"').  'collect2'
     strips version information after this suffix when generating global
     constructor and destructor names.  This define is only needed on
     targets that use 'collect2' to process constructors and
     destructors.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Instruction Output,  Next: Dispatch Tables,  Prev: Macros for Initialization,  Up: Assembler Format

17.21.7 Output of Assembler Instructions
----------------------------------------

This describes assembler instruction output.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_NAMES
     A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
     registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what
     translates register numbers in the compiler into assembler
     language.

 -- Macro: ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES
     If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing a
     name and a register number.  This macro defines additional names
     for hard registers, thus allowing the 'asm' option in declarations
     to refer to registers using alternate names.

 -- Macro: OVERLAPPING_REGISTER_NAMES
     If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing a
     name, a register number and a count of the number of consecutive
     machine registers the name overlaps.  This macro defines additional
     names for hard registers, thus allowing the 'asm' option in
     declarations to refer to registers using alternate names.  Unlike
     'ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES', this macro should be used when the
     register name implies multiple underlying registers.

     This macro should be used when it is important that a clobber in an
     'asm' statement clobbers all the underlying values implied by the
     register name.  For example, on ARM, clobbering the
     double-precision VFP register "d0" implies clobbering both
     single-precision registers "s0" and "s1".

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)
     Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
     requires different names for the machine instructions.

     The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
     assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
     macro-operand PTR is a variable of type 'char *' which points to
     the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is written in
     the machine description.  The definition should output the opcode
     name to STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and
     increment the variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so
     that it will not be output twice.

     In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire
     opcode name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to
     process text that includes '%'-sequences to substitute operands,
     you must take care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to
     increment PTR over whatever text should not be output normally.

     If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
     elements of 'recog_data.operand'.

     If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output in
     the usual way.

 -- Macro: FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (INSN, OPVEC, NOPERANDS)
     If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output
     of assembler code for INSN, to modify the extracted operands so
     they will be output differently.

     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of the
     vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The contents
     of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn template
     into assembler code, so you can change the assembler output by
     changing the contents of the vector.

     This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
     file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently,
     you can cause a large class of instructions to be output
     differently (such as with rearranged operands).  Naturally,
     variations in assembler syntax affecting individual insn patterns
     ought to be handled by writing conditional output routines in those
     patterns.

     If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_FINAL_POSTSCAN_INSN (FILE *FILE, rtx
          INSN, rtx *OPVEC, int NOPERANDS)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which is executed just
     after the output of assembler code for INSN, to change the mode of
     the assembler if necessary.

     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of the
     vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The contents
     of this vector are what was used to convert the insn template into
     assembler code, so you can change the assembler mode by checking
     the contents of the vector.

 -- Macro: PRINT_OPERAND (STREAM, X, CODE)
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand X.  X is an RTL
     expression.

     CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of
     printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
     printed differently depending on the context.  CODE comes from the
     '%' specification that was used to request printing of the operand.
     If the specification was just '%DIGIT' then CODE is 0; if the
     specification was '%LTR DIGIT' then CODE is the ASCII code for LTR.

     If X is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
     The names can be found in an array 'reg_names' whose type is 'char
     *[]'.  'reg_names' is initialized from 'REGISTER_NAMES'.

     When the machine description has a specification '%PUNCT' (a '%'
     followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called with a
     null pointer for X and the punctuation character for CODE.

 -- Macro: PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (CODE)
     A C expression which evaluates to true if CODE is a valid
     punctuation character for use in the 'PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  If
     'PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' is not defined, it means that no
     punctuation characters (except for the standard one, '%') are used
     in this way.

 -- Macro: PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (STREAM, X)
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory
     reference whose address is X.  X is an RTL expression.

     On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
     section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
     hook 'TARGET_ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information into the
     'symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  *Note Assembler
     Format::.

 -- Macro: DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND (FILE)
     A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions
     have been output.  If necessary, call 'dbr_sequence_length' to
     determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
     currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to
     output, or whatever.

     Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful
     in reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is
     made explicit (e.g. with white space).

 Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e. when
the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could be found.)
The variable 'final_sequence' is null when not processing a sequence,
otherwise it contains the 'sequence' rtx being output.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_PREFIX
 -- Macro: LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX
 -- Macro: USER_LABEL_PREFIX
 -- Macro: IMMEDIATE_PREFIX
     If defined, C string expressions to be used for the '%R', '%L',
     '%U', and '%I' options of 'asm_fprintf' (see 'final.c').  These are
     useful when a single 'md' file must support multiple assembler
     formats.  In that case, the various 'tm.h' files can define these
     macros differently.

 -- Macro: ASM_FPRINTF_EXTENSIONS (FILE, ARGPTR, FORMAT)
     If defined this macro should expand to a series of 'case'
     statements which will be parsed inside the 'switch' statement of
     the 'asm_fprintf' function.  This allows targets to define extra
     printf formats which may useful when generating their assembler
     statements.  Note that uppercase letters are reserved for future
     generic extensions to asm_fprintf, and so are not available to
     target specific code.  The output file is given by the parameter
     FILE.  The varargs input pointer is ARGPTR and the rest of the
     format string, starting the character after the one that is being
     switched upon, is pointed to by FORMAT.

 -- Macro: ASSEMBLER_DIALECT
     If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language
     (such as different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression
     that gives the numeric index of the assembler language dialect to
     use, with zero as the first variant.

     If this macro is defined, you may use constructs of the form
          '{option0|option1|option2...}'
     in the output templates of patterns (*note Output Template::) or in
     the first argument of 'asm_fprintf'.  This construct outputs
     'option0', 'option1', 'option2', etc., if the value of
     'ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is zero, one, two, etc.  Any special characters
     within these strings retain their usual meaning.  If there are
     fewer alternatives within the braces than the value of
     'ASSEMBLER_DIALECT', the construct outputs nothing.  If it's needed
     to print curly braces or '|' character in assembler output
     directly, '%{', '%}' and '%|' can be used.

     If you do not define this macro, the characters '{', '|' and '}' do
     not have any special meaning when used in templates or operands to
     'asm_fprintf'.

     Define the macros 'REGISTER_PREFIX', 'LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX',
     'USER_LABEL_PREFIX' and 'IMMEDIATE_PREFIX' if you can express the
     variations in assembler language syntax with that mechanism.
     Define 'ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' and use the '{option0|option1}' syntax
     if the syntax variant are larger and involve such things as
     different opcodes or operand order.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_REG_PUSH (STREAM, REGNO)
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     push hard register number REGNO onto the stack.  The code need not
     be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_REG_POP (STREAM, REGNO)
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     pop hard register number REGNO off of the stack.  The code need not
     be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.

17.21.8 Output of Dispatch Tables
---------------------------------

This concerns dispatch tables.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (STREAM, BODY, VALUE, REL)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     pseudo-instruction to generate a difference between two labels.
     VALUE and REL are the numbers of two internal labels.  The
     definitions of these labels are output using
     '(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)', and they must be printed in
     the same way here.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
                   VALUE, REL)

     You must provide this macro on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.  If
     defined, GCC will also use this macro on all machines when
     producing PIC.  BODY is the body of the 'ADDR_DIFF_VEC'; it is
     provided so that the mode and flags can be read.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (STREAM, VALUE)
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are absolute.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio
     stream STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a
     reference to a label.  VALUE is the number of an internal label
     whose definition is output using
     '(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)'.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d\n", VALUE)

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM, TABLE)
     Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
     specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
     '(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)'; the fourth argument is the
     jump-table which follows (a 'jump_table_data' containing an
     'addr_vec' or 'addr_diff_vec').

     This feature is used on system V to output a 'swbeg' statement for
     the table.

     If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
     '(*targetm.asm_out.internal_label)'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (STREAM, NUM, TABLE)
     Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
     jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
     after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
     the appropriate code to stdio stream STREAM.  The argument TABLE is
     the jump-table insn, and NUM is the label-number of the preceding
     label.

     If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end
     of the jump-table.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EMIT_UNWIND_LABEL (FILE *STREAM, tree
          DECL, int FOR_EH, int EMPTY)
     This target hook emits a label at the beginning of each FDE.  It
     should be defined on targets where FDEs need special labels, and it
     should write the appropriate label, for the FDE associated with the
     function declaration DECL, to the stdio stream STREAM.  The third
     argument, FOR_EH, is a boolean: true if this is for an exception
     table.  The fourth argument, EMPTY, is a boolean: true if this is a
     placeholder label for an omitted FDE.

     The default is that FDEs are not given nonlocal labels.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EMIT_EXCEPT_TABLE_LABEL (FILE *STREAM)
     This target hook emits a label at the beginning of the exception
     table.  It should be defined on targets where it is desirable for
     the table to be broken up according to function.

     The default is that no label is emitted.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_EMIT_EXCEPT_PERSONALITY (rtx
          PERSONALITY)
     If the target implements 'TARGET_ASM_UNWIND_EMIT', this hook may be
     used to emit a directive to install a personality hook into the
     unwind info.  This hook should not be used if dwarf2 unwind info is
     used.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_UNWIND_EMIT (FILE *STREAM, rtx INSN)
     This target hook emits assembly directives required to unwind the
     given instruction.  This is only used when
     'TARGET_EXCEPT_UNWIND_INFO' returns 'UI_TARGET'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_UNWIND_EMIT_BEFORE_INSN
     True if the 'TARGET_ASM_UNWIND_EMIT' hook should be called before
     the assembly for INSN has been emitted, false if the hook should be
     called afterward.

17.21.9 Assembler Commands for Exception Regions
------------------------------------------------

This describes commands marking the start and the end of an exception
region.

 -- Macro: EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME
     If defined, a C string constant for the name of the section
     containing exception handling frame unwind information.  If not
     defined, GCC will provide a default definition if the target
     supports named sections.  'crtstuff.c' uses this macro to switch to
     the appropriate section.

     You should define this symbol if your target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information and the default definition does not work.

 -- Macro: EH_FRAME_IN_DATA_SECTION
     If defined, DWARF 2 frame unwind information will be placed in the
     data section even though the target supports named sections.  This
     might be necessary, for instance, if the system linker does garbage
     collection and sections cannot be marked as not to be collected.

     Do not define this macro unless 'TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION' is also
     defined.

 -- Macro: EH_TABLES_CAN_BE_READ_ONLY
     Define this macro to 1 if your target is such that no frame unwind
     information encoding used with non-PIC code will ever require a
     runtime relocation, but the linker may not support merging
     read-only and read-write sections into a single read-write section.

 -- Macro: MASK_RETURN_ADDR
     An rtx used to mask the return address found via 'RETURN_ADDR_RTX',
     so that it does not contain any extraneous set bits in it.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO
     Define this macro to 0 if your target supports DWARF 2 frame unwind
     information, but it does not yet work with exception handling.
     Otherwise, if your target supports this information (if it defines
     'INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and 'OBJECT_FORMAT_ELF'), GCC will
     provide a default definition of 1.

 -- Common Target Hook: enum unwind_info_type TARGET_EXCEPT_UNWIND_INFO
          (struct gcc_options *OPTS)
     This hook defines the mechanism that will be used for exception
     handling by the target.  If the target has ABI specified unwind
     tables, the hook should return 'UI_TARGET'.  If the target is to
     use the 'setjmp'/'longjmp'-based exception handling scheme, the
     hook should return 'UI_SJLJ'.  If the target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information, the hook should return 'UI_DWARF2'.

     A target may, if exceptions are disabled, choose to return
     'UI_NONE'.  This may end up simplifying other parts of
     target-specific code.  The default implementation of this hook
     never returns 'UI_NONE'.

     Note that the value returned by this hook should be constant.  It
     should not depend on anything except the command-line switches
     described by OPTS.  In particular, the setting 'UI_SJLJ' must be
     fixed at compiler start-up as C pre-processor macros and builtin
     functions related to exception handling are set up depending on
     this setting.

     The default implementation of the hook first honors the
     '--enable-sjlj-exceptions' configure option, then
     'DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO', and finally defaults to 'UI_SJLJ'.  If
     'DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO' depends on command-line options, the target
     must define this hook so that OPTS is used correctly.

 -- Common Target Hook: bool TARGET_UNWIND_TABLES_DEFAULT
     This variable should be set to 'true' if the target ABI requires
     unwinding tables even when exceptions are not used.  It must not be
     modified by command-line option processing.

 -- Macro: DONT_USE_BUILTIN_SETJMP
     Define this macro to 1 if the 'setjmp'/'longjmp'-based scheme
     should use the 'setjmp'/'longjmp' functions from the C library
     instead of the '__builtin_setjmp'/'__builtin_longjmp' machinery.

 -- Macro: JMP_BUF_SIZE
     This macro has no effect unless 'DONT_USE_BUILTIN_SETJMP' is also
     defined.  Define this macro if the default size of 'jmp_buf' buffer
     for the 'setjmp'/'longjmp'-based exception handling mechanism is
     not large enough, or if it is much too large.  The default size is
     'FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER * sizeof(void *)'.

 -- Macro: DWARF_CIE_DATA_ALIGNMENT
     This macro need only be defined if the target might save registers
     in the function prologue at an offset to the stack pointer that is
     not aligned to 'UNITS_PER_WORD'.  The definition should be the
     negative minimum alignment if 'STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined,
     and the positive minimum alignment otherwise.  *Note SDB and
     DWARF::.  Only applicable if the target supports DWARF 2 frame
     unwind information.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_TERMINATE_DW2_EH_FRAME_INFO
     Contains the value true if the target should add a zero word onto
     the end of a Dwarf-2 frame info section when used for exception
     handling.  Default value is false if 'EH_FRAME_SECTION_NAME' is
     defined, and true otherwise.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_DWARF_REGISTER_SPAN (rtx REG)
     Given a register, this hook should return a parallel of registers
     to represent where to find the register pieces.  Define this hook
     if the register and its mode are represented in Dwarf in
     non-contiguous locations, or if the register should be represented
     in more than one register in Dwarf.  Otherwise, this hook should
     return 'NULL_RTX'.  If not defined, the default is to return
     'NULL_RTX'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INIT_DWARF_REG_SIZES_EXTRA (tree ADDRESS)
     If some registers are represented in Dwarf-2 unwind information in
     multiple pieces, define this hook to fill in information about the
     sizes of those pieces in the table used by the unwinder at runtime.
     It will be called by 'expand_builtin_init_dwarf_reg_sizes' after
     filling in a single size corresponding to each hard register;
     ADDRESS is the address of the table.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ASM_TTYPE (rtx SYM)
     This hook is used to output a reference from a frame unwinding
     table to the type_info object identified by SYM.  It should return
     'true' if the reference was output.  Returning 'false' will cause
     the reference to be output using the normal Dwarf2 routines.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ARM_EABI_UNWINDER
     This flag should be set to 'true' on targets that use an ARM EABI
     based unwinding library, and 'false' on other targets.  This
     effects the format of unwinding tables, and how the unwinder in
     entered after running a cleanup.  The default is 'false'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Alignment Output,  Prev: Exception Region Output,  Up: Assembler Format

17.21.10 Assembler Commands for Alignment
-----------------------------------------

This describes commands for alignment.

 -- Macro: JUMP_ALIGN (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which is a
     common destination of jumps and has no fallthru incoming edge.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable ALIGN_JUMPS in the target's
     'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the
     user's selection in ALIGN_JUMPS in a 'JUMP_ALIGN' implementation.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ASM_JUMP_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP (rtx LABEL)
     The maximum number of bytes to skip before LABEL when applying
     'JUMP_ALIGN'.  This works only if 'ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is
     defined.

 -- Macro: LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL, which follows
     a 'BARRIER'.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ASM_LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER_MAX_SKIP (rtx
          LABEL)
     The maximum number of bytes to skip before LABEL when applying
     'LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER'.  This works only if
     'ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

 -- Macro: LOOP_ALIGN (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL that heads a
     frequently executed basic block (usually the header of a loop).

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable 'align_loops' in the target's
     'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the
     user's selection in 'align_loops' in a 'LOOP_ALIGN' implementation.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ASM_LOOP_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP (rtx LABEL)
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying 'LOOP_ALIGN' to
     LABEL.  This works only if 'ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

 -- Macro: LABEL_ALIGN (LABEL)
     The alignment (log base 2) to put in front of LABEL.  If
     'LABEL_ALIGN_AFTER_BARRIER' / 'LOOP_ALIGN' specify a different
     alignment, the maximum of the specified values is used.

     Unless it's necessary to inspect the LABEL parameter, it is better
     to set the variable 'align_labels' in the target's
     'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE'.  Otherwise, you should try to honor the
     user's selection in 'align_labels' in a 'LABEL_ALIGN'
     implementation.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_ASM_LABEL_ALIGN_MAX_SKIP (rtx LABEL)
     The maximum number of bytes to skip when applying 'LABEL_ALIGN' to
     LABEL.  This works only if 'ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN' is defined.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (STREAM, NBYTES)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to advance the location counter by NBYTES bytes.  Those
     bytes should be zero when loaded.  NBYTES will be a C expression of
     type 'unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT'.

 -- Macro: ASM_NO_SKIP_IN_TEXT
     Define this macro if 'ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP' should not be used in the
     text section because it fails to put zeros in the bytes that are
     skipped.  This is true on many Unix systems, where the pseudo-op to
     skip bytes produces no-op instructions rather than zeros when used
     in the text section.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes.  POWER will be a C expression of type 'int'.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN_WITH_NOP (STREAM, POWER)
     Like 'ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN', except that the "nop" instruction is used
     for padding, if necessary.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_MAX_SKIP_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER, MAX_SKIP)
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes, but only if MAX_SKIP or fewer bytes are needed to
     satisfy the alignment request.  POWER and MAX_SKIP will be a C
     expression of type 'int'.

File: gccint.info,  Node: All Debuggers,  Next: DBX Options,  Up: Debugging Info

17.22.1 Macros Affecting All Debugging Formats
----------------------------------------------

These macros affect all debugging formats.

 -- Macro: DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)
     A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the
     compiler register number REGNO.  In the default macro provided, the
     value of this expression will be REGNO itself.  But sometimes there
     are some registers that the compiler knows about and DBX does not,
     or vice versa.  In such cases, some register may need to have one
     number in the compiler and another for DBX.

     If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GCC, and they can
     be used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they _must_ have
     consecutive numbers after renumbering with 'DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER'.
     Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to access such a pair, because
     they expect register pairs to be consecutive in their own numbering
     scheme.

     If you find yourself defining 'DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER' in way that
     does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
     redefine the actual register numbering scheme.

 -- Macro: DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (X)
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     automatic variable having address X (an RTL expression).  The
     default computation assumes that X is based on the frame-pointer
     and gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for
     targets that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style
     debugging output for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be
     eliminated when the '-g' options is used.

 -- Macro: DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (OFFSET, X)
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     argument having address X (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset
     is OFFSET.

 -- Macro: PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE
     A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GCC should
     produce when the user specifies just '-g'.  Define this if you have
     arranged for GCC to support more than one format of debugging
     output.  Currently, the allowable values are 'DBX_DEBUG',
     'SDB_DEBUG', 'DWARF_DEBUG', 'DWARF2_DEBUG', 'XCOFF_DEBUG',
     'VMS_DEBUG', and 'VMS_AND_DWARF2_DEBUG'.

     When the user specifies '-ggdb', GCC normally also uses the value
     of this macro to select the debugging output format, but with two
     exceptions.  If 'DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO' is defined, GCC uses the
     value 'DWARF2_DEBUG'.  Otherwise, if 'DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO' is
     defined, GCC uses 'DBX_DEBUG'.

     The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output;
     the user can always get a specific type of output by using
     '-gstabs', '-gcoff', '-gdwarf-2', '-gxcoff', or '-gvms'.

17.22.2 Specific Options for DBX Output
---------------------------------------

These are specific options for DBX output.

 -- Macro: DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce debugging output for DBX in
     response to the '-g' option.

 -- Macro: XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce XCOFF format debugging
     output in response to the '-g' option.  This is a variant of DBX
     format.

 -- Macro: DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS
     Define this macro to control whether GCC should by default generate
     GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information (assuming
     DBX-format debugging information is enabled at all).  If you don't
     define the macro, the default is 1: always generate the extended
     information if there is any occasion to.

 -- Macro: DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT
     Define this macro if all '.stabs' commands should be output while
     in the text section.

 -- Macro: ASM_STABS_OP
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler pseudo
     op to use instead of '"\t.stabs\t"' to define an ordinary debugging
     symbol.  If you don't define this macro, '"\t.stabs\t"' is used.
     This macro applies only to DBX debugging information format.

 -- Macro: ASM_STABD_OP
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler pseudo
     op to use instead of '"\t.stabd\t"' to define a debugging symbol
     whose value is the current location.  If you don't define this
     macro, '"\t.stabd\t"' is used.  This macro applies only to DBX
     debugging information format.

 -- Macro: ASM_STABN_OP
     A C string constant, including spacing, naming the assembler pseudo
     op to use instead of '"\t.stabn\t"' to define a debugging symbol
     with no name.  If you don't define this macro, '"\t.stabn\t"' is
     used.  This macro applies only to DBX debugging information format.

 -- Macro: DBX_NO_XREFS
     Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the
     construct 'xsTAGNAME'.  On some systems, this construct is used to
     describe a forward reference to a structure named TAGNAME.  On
     other systems, this construct is not supported at all.

 -- Macro: DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH
     A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
     continued (split into two separate '.stabs' directives) when it
     exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
     operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others,
     splitting must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining
     this macro with the value zero.  You can override the default
     splitting-length by defining this macro as an expression for the
     length you desire.

 -- Macro: DBX_CONTIN_CHAR
     Normally continuation is indicated by adding a '\' character to the
     end of a '.stabs' string when a continuation follows.  To use a
     different character instead, define this macro as a character
     constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this
     macro if backslash is correct for your system.

 -- Macro: DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION
     Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section
     before outputting the '.stabs' pseudo-op for a non-global static
     variable.

 -- Macro: DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE
     The value to use in the "code" field of the '.stabs' directive for
     a typedef.  The default is 'N_LSYM'.

 -- Macro: DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE
     The value to use in the "code" field of the '.stabs' directive for
     a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
     provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is 'N_FUN'.

 -- Macro: DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE
     The value to use in the "code" field of the '.stabs' directive for
     a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
     "right" way to do this.  The default is 'N_RSYM'.

 -- Macro: DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily
     provide any way to do this.  The default is ''P''.

 -- Macro: DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST
     Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
     arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.
     Normally, in DBX format, the debugging information entirely follows
     the assembler code.

 -- Macro: DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE
     Define this macro, with value 1, if the value of a symbol
     describing the scope of a block ('N_LBRAC' or 'N_RBRAC') should be
     relative to the start of the enclosing function.  Normally, GCC
     uses an absolute address.

 -- Macro: DBX_LINES_FUNCTION_RELATIVE
     Define this macro, with value 1, if the value of a symbol
     indicating the current line number ('N_SLINE') should be relative
     to the start of the enclosing function.  Normally, GCC uses an
     absolute address.

 -- Macro: DBX_USE_BINCL
     Define this macro if GCC should generate 'N_BINCL' and 'N_EINCL'
     stabs for included header files, as on Sun systems.  This macro
     also directs GCC to output a type number as a pair of a file number
     and a type number within the file.  Normally, GCC does not generate
     'N_BINCL' or 'N_EINCL' stabs, and it outputs a single number for a
     type number.

17.22.3 Open-Ended Hooks for DBX Format
---------------------------------------

These are hooks for DBX format.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE, COUNTER)
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information before code for
     line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio stream
     STREAM.  COUNTER is the number of time the macro was invoked,
     including the current invocation; it is intended to generate unique
     labels in the assembly output.

     This macro should not be defined if the default output is correct,
     or if it can be made correct by defining
     'DBX_LINES_FUNCTION_RELATIVE'.

 -- Macro: NO_DBX_FUNCTION_END
     Some stabs encapsulation formats (in particular ECOFF), cannot
     handle the '.stabs "",N_FUN,,0,0,Lscope-function-1' gdb dbx
     extension construct.  On those machines, define this macro to turn
     this feature off without disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

 -- Macro: NO_DBX_BNSYM_ENSYM
     Some assemblers cannot handle the '.stabd BNSYM/ENSYM,0,0' gdb dbx
     extension construct.  On those machines, define this macro to turn
     this feature off without disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

17.22.4 File Names in DBX Format
--------------------------------

This describes file names in DBX format.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM, which indicates that file NAME is the main source
     file--the file specified as the input file for compilation.  This
     macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

     It may be necessary to refer to a label equal to the beginning of
     the text section.  You can use 'assemble_name (stream,
     ltext_label_name)' to do so.  If you do this, you must also set the
     variable USED_LTEXT_LABEL_NAME to 'true'.

 -- Macro: NO_DBX_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY
     Define this macro, with value 1, if GCC should not emit an
     indication of the current directory for compilation and current
     source language at the beginning of the file.

 -- Macro: NO_DBX_GCC_MARKER
     Define this macro, with value 1, if GCC should not emit an
     indication that this object file was compiled by GCC.  The default
     is to emit an 'N_OPT' stab at the beginning of every source file,
     with 'gcc2_compiled.' for the string and value 0.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (STREAM, NAME)
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of
     compilation of the main source file NAME.  Output should be written
     to the stdio stream STREAM.

     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the
     end of compilation, which is correct for most machines.

 -- Macro: DBX_OUTPUT_NULL_N_SO_AT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END
     Define this macro _instead of_ defining
     'DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END', if what needs to be output at
     the end of compilation is an 'N_SO' stab with an empty string,
     whose value is the highest absolute text address in the file.

17.22.5 Macros for SDB and DWARF Output
---------------------------------------

Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.

 -- Macro: SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce COFF-style debugging output
     for SDB in response to the '-g' option.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce dwarf version 2 format
     debugging output in response to the '-g' option.

      -- Target Hook: int TARGET_DWARF_CALLING_CONVENTION (const_tree
               FUNCTION)
          Define this to enable the dwarf attribute
          'DW_AT_calling_convention' to be emitted for each function.
          Instead of an integer return the enum value for the 'DW_CC_'
          tag.

     To support optional call frame debugging information, you must also
     define 'INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX' and either set
     'RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P' on the prologue insns if you use RTL for the
     prologue, or call 'dwarf2out_def_cfa' and 'dwarf2out_reg_save' as
     appropriate from 'TARGET_ASM_FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' if you don't.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_FRAME_INFO
     Define this macro to a nonzero value if GCC should always output
     Dwarf 2 frame information.  If 'TARGET_EXCEPT_UNWIND_INFO' (*note
     Exception Region Output::) returns 'UI_DWARF2', and exceptions are
     enabled, GCC will output this information not matter how you define
     'DWARF2_FRAME_INFO'.

 -- Target Hook: enum unwind_info_type TARGET_DEBUG_UNWIND_INFO (void)
     This hook defines the mechanism that will be used for describing
     frame unwind information to the debugger.  Normally the hook will
     return 'UI_DWARF2' if DWARF 2 debug information is enabled, and
     return 'UI_NONE' otherwise.

     A target may return 'UI_DWARF2' even when DWARF 2 debug information
     is disabled in order to always output DWARF 2 frame information.

     A target may return 'UI_TARGET' if it has ABI specified unwind
     tables.  This will suppress generation of the normal debug frame
     unwind information.

 -- Macro: DWARF2_ASM_LINE_DEBUG_INFO
     Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the assembler can
     generate Dwarf 2 line debug info sections.  This will result in
     much more compact line number tables, and hence is desirable if it
     works.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_WANT_DEBUG_PUB_SECTIONS
     True if the '.debug_pubtypes' and '.debug_pubnames' sections should
     be emitted.  These sections are not used on most platforms, and in
     particular GDB does not use them.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FORCE_AT_COMP_DIR
     True if the 'DW_AT_comp_dir' attribute should be emitted for each
     compilation unit.  This attribute is required for the darwin linker
     to emit debug information.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_DELAY_SCHED2
     True if sched2 is not to be run at its normal place.  This usually
     means it will be run as part of machine-specific reorg.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_DELAY_VARTRACK
     True if vartrack is not to be run at its normal place.  This
     usually means it will be run as part of machine-specific reorg.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_DELTA (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL1, LABEL2)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a difference
     LAB1 minus LAB2, using an integer of the given SIZE.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_VMS_DELTA (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL1, LABEL2)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a difference
     between the two given labels in system defined units, e.g.
     instruction slots on IA64 VMS, using an integer of the given size.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_OFFSET (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL, SECTION)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a
     section-relative reference to the given LABEL, using an integer of
     the given SIZE.  The label is known to be defined in the given
     SECTION.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_PCREL (STREAM, SIZE, LABEL)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a
     self-relative reference to the given LABEL, using an integer of the
     given SIZE.

 -- Macro: ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_TABLE_REF (LABEL)
     A C statement to issue assembly directives that create a reference
     to the DWARF table identifier LABEL from the current section.  This
     is used on some systems to avoid garbage collecting a DWARF table
     which is referenced by a function.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ASM_OUTPUT_DWARF_DTPREL (FILE *FILE, int
          SIZE, rtx X)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which outputs a
     DTP-relative reference to the given TLS symbol of the specified
     size.

 -- Macro: PUT_SDB_ ...
     Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the
     special SDB assembler directives.  See 'sdbout.c' for a list of
     these macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used,
     you need not define them yourself.

 -- Macro: SDB_DELIM
     Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even
     between SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro
     to be the delimiter to use (usually '\n').  It is not necessary to
     define a new set of 'PUT_SDB_OP' macros if this is the only change
     required.

 -- Macro: SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES
     Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure, union,
     or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not allow
     handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for it.

 -- Macro: SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES
     Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
     enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
     assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.

 -- Macro: SDB_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE)
     A C statement to output SDB debugging information before code for
     line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio stream
     STREAM.  The default is to emit an '.ln' directive.

17.22.6 Macros for VMS Debug Format
-----------------------------------

Here are macros for VMS debug format.

 -- Macro: VMS_DEBUGGING_INFO
     Define this macro if GCC should produce debugging output for VMS in
     response to the '-g' option.  The default behavior for VMS is to
     generate minimal debug info for a traceback in the absence of '-g'
     unless explicitly overridden with '-g0'.  This behavior is
     controlled by 'TARGET_OPTION_OPTIMIZATION' and
     'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Floating Point,  Next: Mode Switching,  Prev: Debugging Info,  Up: Target Macros

17.23 Cross Compilation and Floating Point
==========================================

While all modern machines use twos-complement representation for
integers, there are a variety of representations for floating point
numbers.  This means that in a cross-compiler the representation of
floating point numbers in the compiled program may be different from
that used in the machine doing the compilation.

 Because different representation systems may offer different amounts of
range and precision, all floating point constants must be represented in
the target machine's format.  Therefore, the cross compiler cannot
safely use the host machine's floating point arithmetic; it must emulate
the target's arithmetic.  To ensure consistency, GCC always uses
emulation to work with floating point values, even when the host and
target floating point formats are identical.

 The following macros are provided by 'real.h' for the compiler to use.
All parts of the compiler which generate or optimize floating-point
calculations must use these macros.  They may evaluate their operands
more than once, so operands must not have side effects.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE
     The C data type to be used to hold a floating point value in the
     target machine's format.  Typically this is a 'struct' containing
     an array of 'HOST_WIDE_INT', but all code should treat it as an
     opaque quantity.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, REAL_VALUE_TYPE Y)
     Compares for equality the two values, X and Y.  If the target
     floating point format supports negative zeroes and/or NaNs,
     'REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (-0.0, 0.0)' is true, and 'REAL_VALUES_EQUAL
     (NaN, NaN)' is false.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUES_LESS (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, REAL_VALUE_TYPE Y)
     Tests whether X is less than Y.

 -- Macro: HOST_WIDE_INT REAL_VALUE_FIX (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Truncates X to a signed integer, rounding toward zero.

 -- Macro: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX
          (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Truncates X to an unsigned integer, rounding toward zero.  If X is
     negative, returns zero.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_ATOF (const char *STRING, enum
          machine_mode MODE)
     Converts STRING into a floating point number in the target
     machine's representation for mode MODE.  This routine can handle
     both decimal and hexadecimal floating point constants, using the
     syntax defined by the C language for both.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUE_NEGATIVE (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Returns 1 if X is negative (including negative zero), 0 otherwise.

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUE_ISINF (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Determines whether X represents infinity (positive or negative).

 -- Macro: int REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Determines whether X represents a "NaN" (not-a-number).

 -- Macro: void REAL_ARITHMETIC (REAL_VALUE_TYPE OUTPUT, enum tree_code
          CODE, REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, REAL_VALUE_TYPE Y)
     Calculates an arithmetic operation on the two floating point values
     X and Y, storing the result in OUTPUT (which must be a variable).

     The operation to be performed is specified by CODE.  Only the
     following codes are supported: 'PLUS_EXPR', 'MINUS_EXPR',
     'MULT_EXPR', 'RDIV_EXPR', 'MAX_EXPR', 'MIN_EXPR'.

     If 'REAL_ARITHMETIC' is asked to evaluate division by zero and the
     target's floating point format cannot represent infinity, it will
     call 'abort'.  Callers should check for this situation first, using
     'MODE_HAS_INFINITIES'.  *Note Storage Layout::.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Returns the negative of the floating point value X.

 -- Macro: REAL_VALUE_TYPE REAL_VALUE_ABS (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Returns the absolute value of X.

 -- Macro: void REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (HOST_WIDE_INT LOW, HOST_WIDE_INT
          HIGH, REAL_VALUE_TYPE X)
     Converts a floating point value X into a double-precision integer
     which is then stored into LOW and HIGH.  If the value is not
     integral, it is truncated.

 -- Macro: void REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (REAL_VALUE_TYPE X, HOST_WIDE_INT
          LOW, HOST_WIDE_INT HIGH, enum machine_mode MODE)
     Converts a double-precision integer found in LOW and HIGH, into a
     floating point value which is then stored into X.  The value is
     truncated to fit in mode MODE.

17.24 Mode Switching Instructions
=================================

The following macros control mode switching optimizations:

 -- Macro: OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING (ENTITY)
     Define this macro if the port needs extra instructions inserted for
     mode switching in an optimizing compilation.

     For an example, the SH4 can perform both single and double
     precision floating point operations, but to perform a single
     precision operation, the FPSCR PR bit has to be cleared, while for
     a double precision operation, this bit has to be set.  Changing the
     PR bit requires a general purpose register as a scratch register,
     hence these FPSCR sets have to be inserted before reload, i.e. you
     can't put this into instruction emitting or
     'TARGET_MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG'.

     You can have multiple entities that are mode-switched, and select
     at run time which entities actually need it.
     'OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING' should return nonzero for any ENTITY that
     needs mode-switching.  If you define this macro, you also have to
     define 'NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING', 'MODE_NEEDED',
     'MODE_PRIORITY_TO_MODE' and 'EMIT_MODE_SET'.  'MODE_AFTER',
     'MODE_ENTRY', and 'MODE_EXIT' are optional.

 -- Macro: NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING
     If you define 'OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING', you have to define this as
     initializer for an array of integers.  Each initializer element N
     refers to an entity that needs mode switching, and specifies the
     number of different modes that might need to be set for this
     entity.  The position of the initializer in the
     initializer--starting counting at zero--determines the integer that
     is used to refer to the mode-switched entity in question.  In
     macros that take mode arguments / yield a mode result, modes are
     represented as numbers 0 ... N - 1.  N is used to specify that no
     mode switch is needed / supplied.

 -- Macro: MODE_NEEDED (ENTITY, INSN)
     ENTITY is an integer specifying a mode-switched entity.  If
     'OPTIMIZE_MODE_SWITCHING' is defined, you must define this macro to
     return an integer value not larger than the corresponding element
     in 'NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING', to denote the mode that ENTITY
     must be switched into prior to the execution of INSN.

 -- Macro: MODE_AFTER (ENTITY, MODE, INSN)
     ENTITY is an integer specifying a mode-switched entity.  If this
     macro is defined, it is evaluated for every INSN during mode
     switching.  It determines the mode that an insn results in (if
     different from the incoming mode).

 -- Macro: MODE_ENTRY (ENTITY)
     If this macro is defined, it is evaluated for every ENTITY that
     needs mode switching.  It should evaluate to an integer, which is a
     mode that ENTITY is assumed to be switched to at function entry.
     If 'MODE_ENTRY' is defined then 'MODE_EXIT' must be defined.

 -- Macro: MODE_EXIT (ENTITY)
     If this macro is defined, it is evaluated for every ENTITY that
     needs mode switching.  It should evaluate to an integer, which is a
     mode that ENTITY is assumed to be switched to at function exit.  If
     'MODE_EXIT' is defined then 'MODE_ENTRY' must be defined.

 -- Macro: MODE_PRIORITY_TO_MODE (ENTITY, N)
     This macro specifies the order in which modes for ENTITY are
     processed.  0 is the highest priority,
     'NUM_MODES_FOR_MODE_SWITCHING[ENTITY] - 1' the lowest.  The value
     of the macro should be an integer designating a mode for ENTITY.
     For any fixed ENTITY, 'mode_priority_to_mode' (ENTITY, N) shall be
     a bijection in 0 ... 'num_modes_for_mode_switching[ENTITY] - 1'.

 -- Macro: EMIT_MODE_SET (ENTITY, MODE, HARD_REGS_LIVE)
     Generate one or more insns to set ENTITY to MODE.  HARD_REG_LIVE is
     the set of hard registers live at the point where the insn(s) are
     to be inserted.

17.25 Defining target-specific uses of '__attribute__'
======================================================

Target-specific attributes may be defined for functions, data and types.
These are described using the following target hooks; they also need to
be documented in 'extend.texi'.

 -- Target Hook: const struct attribute_spec * TARGET_ATTRIBUTE_TABLE
     If defined, this target hook points to an array of 'struct
     attribute_spec' (defined in 'tree.h') specifying the machine
     specific attributes for this target and some of the restrictions on
     the entities to which these attributes are applied and the
     arguments they take.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ATTRIBUTE_TAKES_IDENTIFIER_P (const_tree
          NAME)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which returns true if
     the machine-specific attribute named NAME expects an identifier
     given as its first argument to be passed on as a plain identifier,
     not subjected to name lookup.  If this is not defined, the default
     is false for all machine-specific attributes.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (const_tree TYPE1,
          const_tree TYPE2)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which returns zero if
     the attributes on TYPE1 and TYPE2 are incompatible, one if they are
     compatible, and two if they are nearly compatible (which causes a
     warning to be generated).  If this is not defined, machine-specific
     attributes are supposed always to be compatible.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE)
     If defined, this target hook is a function which assigns default
     attributes to the newly defined TYPE.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MERGE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE1, tree
          TYPE2)
     Define this target hook if the merging of type attributes needs
     special handling.  If defined, the result is a list of the combined
     'TYPE_ATTRIBUTES' of TYPE1 and TYPE2.  It is assumed that
     'comptypes' has already been called and returned 1.  This function
     may call 'merge_attributes' to handle machine-independent merging.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MERGE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (tree OLDDECL, tree
          NEWDECL)
     Define this target hook if the merging of decl attributes needs
     special handling.  If defined, the result is a list of the combined
     'DECL_ATTRIBUTES' of OLDDECL and NEWDECL.  NEWDECL is a duplicate
     declaration of OLDDECL.  Examples of when this is needed are when
     one attribute overrides another, or when an attribute is nullified
     by a subsequent definition.  This function may call
     'merge_attributes' to handle machine-independent merging.

     If the only target-specific handling you require is 'dllimport' for
     Microsoft Windows targets, you should define the macro
     'TARGET_DLLIMPORT_DECL_ATTRIBUTES' to '1'.  The compiler will then
     define a function called 'merge_dllimport_decl_attributes' which
     can then be defined as the expansion of
     'TARGET_MERGE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES'.  You can also add
     'handle_dll_attribute' in the attribute table for your port to
     perform initial processing of the 'dllimport' and 'dllexport'
     attributes.  This is done in 'i386/cygwin.h' and 'i386/i386.c', for
     example.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_VALID_DLLIMPORT_ATTRIBUTE_P (const_tree
          DECL)
     DECL is a variable or function with '__attribute__((dllimport))'
     specified.  Use this hook if the target needs to add extra
     validation checks to 'handle_dll_attribute'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_DECLSPEC
     Define this macro to a nonzero value if you want to treat
     '__declspec(X)' as equivalent to '__attribute((X))'.  By default,
     this behavior is enabled only for targets that define
     'TARGET_DLLIMPORT_DECL_ATTRIBUTES'.  The current implementation of
     '__declspec' is via a built-in macro, but you should not rely on
     this implementation detail.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INSERT_ATTRIBUTES (tree NODE, tree
          *ATTR_PTR)
     Define this target hook if you want to be able to add attributes to
     a decl when it is being created.  This is normally useful for back
     ends which wish to implement a pragma by using the attributes which
     correspond to the pragma's effect.  The NODE argument is the decl
     which is being created.  The ATTR_PTR argument is a pointer to the
     attribute list for this decl.  The list itself should not be
     modified, since it may be shared with other decls, but attributes
     may be chained on the head of the list and '*ATTR_PTR' modified to
     point to the new attributes, or a copy of the list may be made if
     further changes are needed.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTE_INLINABLE_P (const_tree
          FNDECL)
     This target hook returns 'true' if it is OK to inline FNDECL into
     the current function, despite its having target-specific
     attributes, 'false' otherwise.  By default, if a function has a
     target specific attribute attached to it, it will not be inlined.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_OPTION_VALID_ATTRIBUTE_P (tree FNDECL, tree
          NAME, tree ARGS, int FLAGS)
     This hook is called to parse 'attribute(target("..."))', which
     allows setting target-specific options on individual functions.
     These function-specific options may differ from the options
     specified on the command line.  The hook should return 'true' if
     the options are valid.

     The hook should set the 'DECL_FUNCTION_SPECIFIC_TARGET' field in
     the function declaration to hold a pointer to a target-specific
     'struct cl_target_option' structure.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_OPTION_SAVE (struct cl_target_option *PTR,
          struct gcc_options *OPTS)
     This hook is called to save any additional target-specific
     information in the 'struct cl_target_option' structure for
     function-specific options from the 'struct gcc_options' structure.
     *Note Option file format::.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_OPTION_RESTORE (struct gcc_options *OPTS,
          struct cl_target_option *PTR)
     This hook is called to restore any additional target-specific
     information in the 'struct cl_target_option' structure for
     function-specific options to the 'struct gcc_options' structure.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_OPTION_PRINT (FILE *FILE, int INDENT,
          struct cl_target_option *PTR)
     This hook is called to print any additional target-specific
     information in the 'struct cl_target_option' structure for
     function-specific options.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_OPTION_PRAGMA_PARSE (tree ARGS, tree
          POP_TARGET)
     This target hook parses the options for '#pragma GCC target', which
     sets the target-specific options for functions that occur later in
     the input stream.  The options accepted should be the same as those
     handled by the 'TARGET_OPTION_VALID_ATTRIBUTE_P' hook.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE (void)
     Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make sense
     on a particular target machine.  You can override the hook
     'TARGET_OPTION_OVERRIDE' to take account of this.  This hooks is
     called once just after all the command options have been parsed.

     Don't use this hook to turn on various extra optimizations for
     '-O'.  That is what 'TARGET_OPTION_OPTIMIZATION' is for.

     If you need to do something whenever the optimization level is
     changed via the optimize attribute or pragma, see
     'TARGET_OVERRIDE_OPTIONS_AFTER_CHANGE'

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_OPTION_FUNCTION_VERSIONS (tree DECL1, tree
          DECL2)
     This target hook returns 'true' if DECL1 and DECL2 are versions of
     the same function.  DECL1 and DECL2 are function versions if and
     only if they have the same function signature and different target
     specific attributes, that is, they are compiled for different
     target machines.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CAN_INLINE_P (tree CALLER, tree CALLEE)
     This target hook returns 'false' if the CALLER function cannot
     inline CALLEE, based on target specific information.  By default,
     inlining is not allowed if the callee function has function
     specific target options and the caller does not use the same
     options.

17.26 Emulating TLS
===================

For targets whose psABI does not provide Thread Local Storage via
specific relocations and instruction sequences, an emulation layer is
used.  A set of target hooks allows this emulation layer to be
configured for the requirements of a particular target.  For instance
the psABI may in fact specify TLS support in terms of an emulation
layer.

 The emulation layer works by creating a control object for every TLS
object.  To access the TLS object, a lookup function is provided which,
when given the address of the control object, will return the address of
the current thread's instance of the TLS object.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_EMUTLS_GET_ADDRESS
     Contains the name of the helper function that uses a TLS control
     object to locate a TLS instance.  The default causes libgcc's
     emulated TLS helper function to be used.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_EMUTLS_REGISTER_COMMON
     Contains the name of the helper function that should be used at
     program startup to register TLS objects that are implicitly
     initialized to zero.  If this is 'NULL', all TLS objects will have
     explicit initializers.  The default causes libgcc's emulated TLS
     registration function to be used.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_EMUTLS_VAR_SECTION
     Contains the name of the section in which TLS control variables
     should be placed.  The default of 'NULL' allows these to be placed
     in any section.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_EMUTLS_TMPL_SECTION
     Contains the name of the section in which TLS initializers should
     be placed.  The default of 'NULL' allows these to be placed in any
     section.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_EMUTLS_VAR_PREFIX
     Contains the prefix to be prepended to TLS control variable names.
     The default of 'NULL' uses a target-specific prefix.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_EMUTLS_TMPL_PREFIX
     Contains the prefix to be prepended to TLS initializer objects.
     The default of 'NULL' uses a target-specific prefix.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_EMUTLS_VAR_FIELDS (tree TYPE, tree *NAME)
     Specifies a function that generates the FIELD_DECLs for a TLS
     control object type.  TYPE is the RECORD_TYPE the fields are for
     and NAME should be filled with the structure tag, if the default of
     '__emutls_object' is unsuitable.  The default creates a type
     suitable for libgcc's emulated TLS function.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_EMUTLS_VAR_INIT (tree VAR, tree DECL, tree
          TMPL_ADDR)
     Specifies a function that generates the CONSTRUCTOR to initialize a
     TLS control object.  VAR is the TLS control object, DECL is the TLS
     object and TMPL_ADDR is the address of the initializer.  The
     default initializes libgcc's emulated TLS control object.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_EMUTLS_VAR_ALIGN_FIXED
     Specifies whether the alignment of TLS control variable objects is
     fixed and should not be increased as some backends may do to
     optimize single objects.  The default is false.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_EMUTLS_DEBUG_FORM_TLS_ADDRESS
     Specifies whether a DWARF 'DW_OP_form_tls_address' location
     descriptor may be used to describe emulated TLS control objects.

17.27 Defining coprocessor specifics for MIPS targets.
======================================================

The MIPS specification allows MIPS implementations to have as many as 4
coprocessors, each with as many as 32 private registers.  GCC supports
accessing these registers and transferring values between the registers
and memory using asm-ized variables.  For example:

       register unsigned int cp0count asm ("c0r1");
       unsigned int d;

       d = cp0count + 3;

 ("c0r1" is the default name of register 1 in coprocessor 0; alternate
names may be added as described below, or the default names may be
overridden entirely in 'SUBTARGET_CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE'.)

 Coprocessor registers are assumed to be epilogue-used; sets to them
will be preserved even if it does not appear that the register is used
again later in the function.

 Another note: according to the MIPS spec, coprocessor 1 (if present) is
the FPU.  One accesses COP1 registers through standard mips
floating-point support; they are not included in this mechanism.

 There is one macro used in defining the MIPS coprocessor interface
which you may want to override in subtargets; it is described below.

17.28 Parameters for Precompiled Header Validity Checking
=========================================================

 -- Target Hook: void * TARGET_GET_PCH_VALIDITY (size_t *SZ)
     This hook returns a pointer to the data needed by
     'TARGET_PCH_VALID_P' and sets '*SZ' to the size of the data in
     bytes.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_PCH_VALID_P (const void *DATA,
          size_t SZ)
     This hook checks whether the options used to create a PCH file are
     compatible with the current settings.  It returns 'NULL' if so and
     a suitable error message if not.  Error messages will be presented
     to the user and must be localized using '_(MSG)'.

     DATA is the data that was returned by 'TARGET_GET_PCH_VALIDITY'
     when the PCH file was created and SZ is the size of that data in
     bytes.  It's safe to assume that the data was created by the same
     version of the compiler, so no format checking is needed.

     The default definition of 'default_pch_valid_p' should be suitable
     for most targets.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_CHECK_PCH_TARGET_FLAGS (int
          PCH_FLAGS)
     If this hook is nonnull, the default implementation of
     'TARGET_PCH_VALID_P' will use it to check for compatible values of
     'target_flags'.  PCH_FLAGS specifies the value that 'target_flags'
     had when the PCH file was created.  The return value is the same as
     for 'TARGET_PCH_VALID_P'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_PREPARE_PCH_SAVE (void)
     Called before writing out a PCH file.  If the target has some
     garbage-collected data that needs to be in a particular state on
     PCH loads, it can use this hook to enforce that state.  Very few
     targets need to do anything here.

17.29 C++ ABI parameters
========================

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_CXX_GUARD_TYPE (void)
     Define this hook to override the integer type used for guard
     variables.  These are used to implement one-time construction of
     static objects.  The default is long_long_integer_type_node.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_GUARD_MASK_BIT (void)
     This hook determines how guard variables are used.  It should
     return 'false' (the default) if the first byte should be used.  A
     return value of 'true' indicates that only the least significant
     bit should be used.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_CXX_GET_COOKIE_SIZE (tree TYPE)
     This hook returns the size of the cookie to use when allocating an
     array whose elements have the indicated TYPE.  Assumes that it is
     already known that a cookie is needed.  The default is 'max(sizeof
     (size_t), alignof(type))', as defined in section 2.7 of the
     IA64/Generic C++ ABI.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_COOKIE_HAS_SIZE (void)
     This hook should return 'true' if the element size should be stored
     in array cookies.  The default is to return 'false'.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_CXX_IMPORT_EXPORT_CLASS (tree TYPE, int
          IMPORT_EXPORT)
     If defined by a backend this hook allows the decision made to
     export class TYPE to be overruled.  Upon entry IMPORT_EXPORT will
     contain 1 if the class is going to be exported, -1 if it is going
     to be imported and 0 otherwise.  This function should return the
     modified value and perform any other actions necessary to support
     the backend's targeted operating system.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_CDTOR_RETURNS_THIS (void)
     This hook should return 'true' if constructors and destructors
     return the address of the object created/destroyed.  The default is
     to return 'false'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_KEY_METHOD_MAY_BE_INLINE (void)
     This hook returns true if the key method for a class (i.e., the
     method which, if defined in the current translation unit, causes
     the virtual table to be emitted) may be an inline function.  Under
     the standard Itanium C++ ABI the key method may be an inline
     function so long as the function is not declared inline in the
     class definition.  Under some variants of the ABI, an inline
     function can never be the key method.  The default is to return
     'true'.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_CXX_DETERMINE_CLASS_DATA_VISIBILITY (tree
          DECL)
     DECL is a virtual table, virtual table table, typeinfo object, or
     other similar implicit class data object that will be emitted with
     external linkage in this translation unit.  No ELF visibility has
     been explicitly specified.  If the target needs to specify a
     visibility other than that of the containing class, use this hook
     to set 'DECL_VISIBILITY' and 'DECL_VISIBILITY_SPECIFIED'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_CLASS_DATA_ALWAYS_COMDAT (void)
     This hook returns true (the default) if virtual tables and other
     similar implicit class data objects are always COMDAT if they have
     external linkage.  If this hook returns false, then class data for
     classes whose virtual table will be emitted in only one translation
     unit will not be COMDAT.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_LIBRARY_RTTI_COMDAT (void)
     This hook returns true (the default) if the RTTI information for
     the basic types which is defined in the C++ runtime should always
     be COMDAT, false if it should not be COMDAT.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_USE_AEABI_ATEXIT (void)
     This hook returns true if '__aeabi_atexit' (as defined by the ARM
     EABI) should be used to register static destructors when
     '-fuse-cxa-atexit' is in effect.  The default is to return false to
     use '__cxa_atexit'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_USE_ATEXIT_FOR_CXA_ATEXIT (void)
     This hook returns true if the target 'atexit' function can be used
     in the same manner as '__cxa_atexit' to register C++ static
     destructors.  This requires that 'atexit'-registered functions in
     shared libraries are run in the correct order when the libraries
     are unloaded.  The default is to return false.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_CXX_ADJUST_CLASS_AT_DEFINITION (tree TYPE)
     TYPE is a C++ class (i.e., RECORD_TYPE or UNION_TYPE) that has just
     been defined.  Use this hook to make adjustments to the class (eg,
     tweak visibility or perform any other required target
     modifications).

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_CXX_DECL_MANGLING_CONTEXT (const_tree DECL)
     Return target-specific mangling context of DECL or 'NULL_TREE'.

17.30 Adding support for named address spaces
=============================================

The draft technical report of the ISO/IEC JTC1 S22 WG14 N1275 standards
committee, 'Programming Languages - C - Extensions to support embedded
processors', specifies a syntax for embedded processors to specify
alternate address spaces.  You can configure a GCC port to support
section 5.1 of the draft report to add support for address spaces other
than the default address space.  These address spaces are new keywords
that are similar to the 'volatile' and 'const' type attributes.

 Pointers to named address spaces can have a different size than
pointers to the generic address space.

 For example, the SPU port uses the '__ea' address space to refer to
memory in the host processor, rather than memory local to the SPU
processor.  Access to memory in the '__ea' address space involves
issuing DMA operations to move data between the host processor and the
local processor memory address space.  Pointers in the '__ea' address
space are either 32 bits or 64 bits based on the '-mea32' or '-mea64'
switches (native SPU pointers are always 32 bits).

 Internally, address spaces are represented as a small integer in the
range 0 to 15 with address space 0 being reserved for the generic
address space.

 To register a named address space qualifier keyword with the C front
end, the target may call the 'c_register_addr_space' routine.  For
example, the SPU port uses the following to declare '__ea' as the
keyword for named address space #1:
     #define ADDR_SPACE_EA 1
     c_register_addr_space ("__ea", ADDR_SPACE_EA);

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_POINTER_MODE
          (addr_space_t ADDRESS_SPACE)
     Define this to return the machine mode to use for pointers to
     ADDRESS_SPACE if the target supports named address spaces.  The
     default version of this hook returns 'ptr_mode' for the generic
     address space only.

 -- Target Hook: enum machine_mode TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_ADDRESS_MODE
          (addr_space_t ADDRESS_SPACE)
     Define this to return the machine mode to use for addresses in
     ADDRESS_SPACE if the target supports named address spaces.  The
     default version of this hook returns 'Pmode' for the generic
     address space only.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_VALID_POINTER_MODE (enum
          machine_mode MODE, addr_space_t AS)
     Define this to return nonzero if the port can handle pointers with
     machine mode MODE to address space AS.  This target hook is the
     same as the 'TARGET_VALID_POINTER_MODE' target hook, except that it
     includes explicit named address space support.  The default version
     of this hook returns true for the modes returned by either the
     'TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_POINTER_MODE' or
     'TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_ADDRESS_MODE' target hooks for the given address
     space.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P (enum
          machine_mode MODE, rtx EXP, bool STRICT, addr_space_t AS)
     Define this to return true if EXP is a valid address for mode MODE
     in the named address space AS.  The STRICT parameter says whether
     strict addressing is in effect after reload has finished.  This
     target hook is the same as the 'TARGET_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS_P' target
     hook, except that it includes explicit named address space support.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (rtx X, rtx
          OLDX, enum machine_mode MODE, addr_space_t AS)
     Define this to modify an invalid address X to be a valid address
     with mode MODE in the named address space AS.  This target hook is
     the same as the 'TARGET_LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS' target hook, except
     that it includes explicit named address space support.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_SUBSET_P (addr_space_t SUBSET,
          addr_space_t SUPERSET)
     Define this to return whether the SUBSET named address space is
     contained within the SUPERSET named address space.  Pointers to a
     named address space that is a subset of another named address space
     will be converted automatically without a cast if used together in
     arithmetic operations.  Pointers to a superset address space can be
     converted to pointers to a subset address space via explicit casts.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_CONVERT (rtx OP, tree FROM_TYPE,
          tree TO_TYPE)
     Define this to convert the pointer expression represented by the
     RTL OP with type FROM_TYPE that points to a named address space to
     a new pointer expression with type TO_TYPE that points to a
     different named address space.  When this hook it called, it is
     guaranteed that one of the two address spaces is a subset of the
     other, as determined by the 'TARGET_ADDR_SPACE_SUBSET_P' target
     hook.

17.31 Miscellaneous Parameters
==============================

Here are several miscellaneous parameters.

 -- Macro: HAS_LONG_COND_BRANCH
     Define this boolean macro to indicate whether or not your
     architecture has conditional branches that can span all of memory.
     It is used in conjunction with an optimization that partitions hot
     and cold basic blocks into separate sections of the executable.  If
     this macro is set to false, gcc will convert any conditional
     branches that attempt to cross between sections into unconditional
     branches or indirect jumps.

 -- Macro: HAS_LONG_UNCOND_BRANCH
     Define this boolean macro to indicate whether or not your
     architecture has unconditional branches that can span all of
     memory.  It is used in conjunction with an optimization that
     partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections of the
     executable.  If this macro is set to false, gcc will convert any
     unconditional branches that attempt to cross between sections into
     indirect jumps.

 -- Macro: CASE_VECTOR_MODE
     An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
     elements of a jump-table should have.

 -- Macro: CASE_VECTOR_SHORTEN_MODE (MIN_OFFSET, MAX_OFFSET, BODY)
     Optional: return the preferred mode for an 'addr_diff_vec' when the
     minimum and maximum offset are known.  If you define this, it
     enables extra code in branch shortening to deal with
     'addr_diff_vec'.  To make this work, you also have to define
     'INSN_ALIGN' and make the alignment for 'addr_diff_vec' explicit.
     The BODY argument is provided so that the offset_unsigned and scale
     flags can be updated.

 -- Macro: CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE
     Define this macro to be a C expression to indicate when jump-tables
     should contain relative addresses.  You need not define this macro
     if jump-tables never contain relative addresses, or jump-tables
     should contain relative addresses only when '-fPIC' or '-fPIC' is
     in effect.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD (void)
     This function return the smallest number of different values for
     which it is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of
     conditional branches.  The default is four for machines with a
     'casesi' instruction and five otherwise.  This is best for most
     machines.

 -- Macro: WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS
     Define this macro if operations between registers with integral
     mode smaller than a word are always performed on the entire
     register.  Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC
     machines do not.

 -- Macro: LOAD_EXTEND_OP (MEM_MODE)
     Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that
     read memory in MEM_MODE, an integral mode narrower than a word, set
     the bits outside of MEM_MODE to be either the sign-extension or the
     zero-extension of the data read.  Return 'SIGN_EXTEND' for values
     of MEM_MODE for which the insn sign-extends, 'ZERO_EXTEND' for
     which it zero-extends, and 'UNKNOWN' for other modes.

     This macro is not called with MEM_MODE non-integral or with a width
     greater than or equal to 'BITS_PER_WORD', so you may return any
     value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always
     return 'UNKNOWN'.  On machines where this macro is defined, you
     will normally define it as the constant 'SIGN_EXTEND' or
     'ZERO_EXTEND'.

     You may return a non-'UNKNOWN' value even if for some hard
     registers the sign extension is not performed, if for the
     'REGNO_REG_CLASS' of these hard registers
     'CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' returns nonzero when the FROM mode is
     MEM_MODE and the TO mode is any integral mode larger than this but
     not larger than 'word_mode'.

     You must return 'UNKNOWN' if for some hard registers that allow
     this mode, 'CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' says that they cannot change
     to 'word_mode', but that they can change to another integral mode
     that is larger then MEM_MODE but still smaller than 'word_mode'.

 -- Macro: SHORT_IMMEDIATES_SIGN_EXTEND
     Define this macro if loading short immediate values into registers
     sign extends.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_MIN_DIVISIONS_FOR_RECIP_MUL (enum
          machine_mode MODE)
     When '-ffast-math' is in effect, GCC tries to optimize divisions by
     the same divisor, by turning them into multiplications by the
     reciprocal.  This target hook specifies the minimum number of
     divisions that should be there for GCC to perform the optimization
     for a variable of mode MODE.  The default implementation returns 3
     if the machine has an instruction for the division, and 2 if it
     does not.

 -- Macro: MOVE_MAX
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly between memory and registers or between two memory
     locations.

 -- Macro: MAX_MOVE_MAX
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly between memory and registers or between two memory
     locations.  If this is undefined, the default is 'MOVE_MAX'.
     Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
     'MOVE_MAX' can have at run-time.

 -- Macro: SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED
     A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of
     bits actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to
     the number of bits needed to represent the size of the object being
     shifted.  When this macro is nonzero, the compiler will assume that
     it is safe to omit a sign-extend, zero-extend, and certain bitwise
     'and' instructions that truncates the count of a shift operation.
     On machines that have instructions that act on bit-fields at
     variable positions, which may include 'bit test' instructions, a
     nonzero 'SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables deletion of
     truncations of the values that serve as arguments to bit-field
     instructions.

     If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
     position (for bit-field operations), or if no variable-position
     bit-field instructions exist, you should define this macro.

     However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0,
     truncation only applies to shift operations and not the (real or
     pretended) bit-field operations.  Define 'SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' to
     be zero on such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the 'md' file
     that include the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

     You need not define this macro if it would always have the value of
     zero.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_SHIFT_TRUNCATION_MASK
          (enum machine_mode MODE)
     This function describes how the standard shift patterns for MODE
     deal with shifts by negative amounts or by more than the width of
     the mode.  *Note shift patterns::.

     On many machines, the shift patterns will apply a mask M to the
     shift count, meaning that a fixed-width shift of X by Y is
     equivalent to an arbitrary-width shift of X by Y & M.  If this is
     true for mode MODE, the function should return M, otherwise it
     should return 0.  A return value of 0 indicates that no particular
     behavior is guaranteed.

     Note that, unlike 'SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED', this function does _not_
     apply to general shift rtxes; it applies only to instructions that
     are generated by the named shift patterns.

     The default implementation of this function returns
     'GET_MODE_BITSIZE (MODE) - 1' if 'SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' and 0
     otherwise.  This definition is always safe, but if
     'SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' is false, and some shift patterns
     nevertheless truncate the shift count, you may get better code by
     overriding it.

 -- Macro: TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (OUTPREC, INPREC)
     A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
     "convert" an integer of INPREC bits to one of OUTPREC bits (where
     OUTPREC is smaller than INPREC) by merely operating on it as if it
     had only OUTPREC bits.

     On many machines, this expression can be 1.

     When 'TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
     modes for which 'MODES_TIEABLE_P' is 0, suboptimal code can result.
     If this is the case, making 'TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' return 0 in
     such cases may improve things.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED (enum machine_mode MODE,
          enum machine_mode REP_MODE)
     The representation of an integral mode can be such that the values
     are always extended to a wider integral mode.  Return 'SIGN_EXTEND'
     if values of MODE are represented in sign-extended form to
     REP_MODE.  Return 'UNKNOWN' otherwise.  (Currently, none of the
     targets use zero-extended representation this way so unlike
     'LOAD_EXTEND_OP', 'TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED' is expected to return
     either 'SIGN_EXTEND' or 'UNKNOWN'.  Also no target extends MODE to
     REP_MODE so that REP_MODE is not the next widest integral mode and
     currently we take advantage of this fact.)

     Similarly to 'LOAD_EXTEND_OP' you may return a non-'UNKNOWN' value
     even if the extension is not performed on certain hard registers as
     long as for the 'REGNO_REG_CLASS' of these hard registers
     'CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS' returns nonzero.

     Note that 'TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED' and 'LOAD_EXTEND_OP' describe
     two related properties.  If you define 'TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED
     (mode, word_mode)' you probably also want to define 'LOAD_EXTEND_OP
     (mode)' to return the same type of extension.

     In order to enforce the representation of 'mode',
     'TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' should return false when truncating to
     'mode'.

 -- Macro: STORE_FLAG_VALUE
     A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison
     operator with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag
     instruction ('cstoreMODE4') when the condition is true.  This
     description must apply to _all_ the 'cstoreMODE4' patterns and all
     the comparison operators whose results have a 'MODE_INT' mode.

     A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
     comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is
     true and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value
     indicates which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the
     comparison is true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the
     comparison operation, which is given by the mode of the first
     operand in the 'cstoreMODE4' pattern.  Either the low bit or the
     sign bit of 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits
     are used by the compiler.

     If 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
     generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
     replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they
     cause the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are
     undefined.  For example, on a machine whose comparison operators
     return an 'SImode' value and where 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as
     '0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
     expression

          (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))

     can be converted to

          (ashift:SI X (const_int N))

     where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being tested
     into the sign bit.

     There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the
     low-order bit for a true value, but does not guarantee the value of
     any other bits, but we do not know of any machine that has such an
     instruction.  If you are trying to port GCC to such a machine,
     include an instruction to perform a logical-and of the result with
     1 in the pattern for the comparison operators and let us know at
     <gcc@gcc.gnu.org>.

     Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a
     value from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules
     to guide the choice of value for 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the
     instructions to be used:

        * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
          'STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
          "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
          the comparison operators to do so because there may be
          opportunities to combine the normalization with other
          operations.

        * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
          being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
          1 preferred on other machines.

        * As a second choice, choose a value of '0x80000001' if
          instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
          but do not define the others.

        * Otherwise, use a value of '0x80000000'.

     Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
     'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and its negation in the same number of
     instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern
     for those cases, e.g., one matching

          (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))

     Some machines can also perform 'and' or 'plus' operations on
     condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
     'cstoreMODE4' insn followed by 'and' or 'plus'.  On those machines,
     define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names 'incscc' and
     'decscc', respectively, for the patterns which perform 'plus' or
     'minus' operations on condition code values.  See 'rs6000.md' for
     some examples.  The GNU Superoptimizer can be used to find such
     instruction sequences on other machines.

     If this macro is not defined, the default value, 1, is used.  You
     need not define 'STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no store-flag
     instructions, or if the value generated by these instructions is 1.

 -- Macro: FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE (MODE)
     A C expression that gives a nonzero 'REAL_VALUE_TYPE' value that is
     returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are
     true.  Define this macro on machines that have comparison
     operations that return floating-point values.  If there are no such
     operations, do not define this macro.

 -- Macro: VECTOR_STORE_FLAG_VALUE (MODE)
     A C expression that gives a rtx representing the nonzero true
     element for vector comparisons.  The returned rtx should be valid
     for the inner mode of MODE which is guaranteed to be a vector mode.
     Define this macro on machines that have vector comparison
     operations that return a vector result.  If there are no such
     operations, do not define this macro.  Typically, this macro is
     defined as 'const1_rtx' or 'constm1_rtx'.  This macro may return
     'NULL_RTX' to prevent the compiler optimizing such vector
     comparison operations for the given mode.

 -- Macro: CLZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO (MODE, VALUE)
 -- Macro: CTZ_DEFINED_VALUE_AT_ZERO (MODE, VALUE)
     A C expression that indicates whether the architecture defines a
     value for 'clz' or 'ctz' with a zero operand.  A result of '0'
     indicates the value is undefined.  If the value is defined for only
     the RTL expression, the macro should evaluate to '1'; if the value
     applies also to the corresponding optab entry (which is normally
     the case if it expands directly into the corresponding RTL), then
     the macro should evaluate to '2'.  In the cases where the value is
     defined, VALUE should be set to this value.

     If this macro is not defined, the value of 'clz' or 'ctz' at zero
     is assumed to be undefined.

     This macro must be defined if the target's expansion for 'ffs'
     relies on a particular value to get correct results.  Otherwise it
     is not necessary, though it may be used to optimize some corner
     cases, and to provide a default expansion for the 'ffs' optab.

     Note that regardless of this macro the "definedness" of 'clz' and
     'ctz' at zero do _not_ extend to the builtin functions visible to
     the user.  Thus one may be free to adjust the value at will to
     match the target expansion of these operations without fear of
     breaking the API.

 -- Macro: Pmode
     An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  On most machines,
     define this to be the integer mode corresponding to the width of a
     hardware pointer; 'SImode' on 32-bit machine or 'DImode' on 64-bit
     machines.  On some machines you must define this to be one of the
     partial integer modes, such as 'PSImode'.

     The width of 'Pmode' must be at least as large as the value of
     'POINTER_SIZE'.  If it is not equal, you must define the macro
     'POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED' to specify how pointers are extended to
     'Pmode'.

 -- Macro: FUNCTION_MODE
     An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to
     functions being called, in 'call' RTL expressions.  On most CISC
     machines, where an instruction can begin at any byte address, this
     should be 'QImode'.  On most RISC machines, where all instructions
     have fixed size and alignment, this should be a mode with the same
     size and alignment as the machine instruction words - typically
     'SImode' or 'HImode'.

 -- Macro: STDC_0_IN_SYSTEM_HEADERS
     In normal operation, the preprocessor expands '__STDC__' to the
     constant 1, to signify that GCC conforms to ISO Standard C.  On
     some hosts, like Solaris, the system compiler uses a different
     convention, where '__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user
     specifies strict conformance to the C Standard.

     Defining 'STDC_0_IN_SYSTEM_HEADERS' makes GNU CPP follows the host
     convention when processing system header files, but when processing
     user files '__STDC__' will always expand to 1.

 -- C Target Hook: const char * TARGET_C_PREINCLUDE (void)
     Define this hook to return the name of a header file to be included
     at the start of all compilations, as if it had been included with
     '#include <FILE>'.  If this hook returns 'NULL', or is not defined,
     or the header is not found, or if the user specifies
     '-ffreestanding' or '-nostdinc', no header is included.

     This hook can be used together with a header provided by the system
     C library to implement ISO C requirements for certain macros to be
     predefined that describe properties of the whole implementation
     rather than just the compiler.

 -- C Target Hook: bool TARGET_CXX_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C (const char*)
     Define this hook to add target-specific C++ implicit extern C
     functions.  If this function returns true for the name of a
     file-scope function, that function implicitly gets extern "C"
     linkage rather than whatever language linkage the declaration would
     normally have.  An example of such function is WinMain on Win32
     targets.

 -- Macro: NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C
     Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well as
     C.  This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header
     files in C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are
     enclosed in 'extern "C" {...}'.

 -- Macro: REGISTER_TARGET_PRAGMAS ()
     Define this macro if you want to implement any target-specific
     pragmas.  If defined, it is a C expression which makes a series of
     calls to 'c_register_pragma' or 'c_register_pragma_with_expansion'
     for each pragma.  The macro may also do any setup required for the
     pragmas.

     The primary reason to define this macro is to provide compatibility
     with other compilers for the same target.  In general, we
     discourage definition of target-specific pragmas for GCC.

     If the pragma can be implemented by attributes then you should
     consider defining the target hook 'TARGET_INSERT_ATTRIBUTES' as
     well.

     Preprocessor macros that appear on pragma lines are not expanded.
     All '#pragma' directives that do not match any registered pragma
     are silently ignored, unless the user specifies
     '-Wunknown-pragmas'.

 -- Function: void c_register_pragma (const char *SPACE, const char
          *NAME, void (*CALLBACK) (struct cpp_reader *))
 -- Function: void c_register_pragma_with_expansion (const char *SPACE,
          const char *NAME, void (*CALLBACK) (struct cpp_reader *))

     Each call to 'c_register_pragma' or
     'c_register_pragma_with_expansion' establishes one pragma.  The
     CALLBACK routine will be called when the preprocessor encounters a
     pragma of the form

          #pragma [SPACE] NAME ...

     SPACE is the case-sensitive namespace of the pragma, or 'NULL' to
     put the pragma in the global namespace.  The callback routine
     receives PFILE as its first argument, which can be passed on to
     cpplib's functions if necessary.  You can lex tokens after the NAME
     by calling 'pragma_lex'.  Tokens that are not read by the callback
     will be silently ignored.  The end of the line is indicated by a
     token of type 'CPP_EOF'.  Macro expansion occurs on the arguments
     of pragmas registered with 'c_register_pragma_with_expansion' but
     not on the arguments of pragmas registered with
     'c_register_pragma'.

     Note that the use of 'pragma_lex' is specific to the C and C++
     compilers.  It will not work in the Java or Fortran compilers, or
     any other language compilers for that matter.  Thus if 'pragma_lex'
     is going to be called from target-specific code, it must only be
     done so when building the C and C++ compilers.  This can be done by
     defining the variables 'c_target_objs' and 'cxx_target_objs' in the
     target entry in the 'config.gcc' file.  These variables should name
     the target-specific, language-specific object file which contains
     the code that uses 'pragma_lex'.  Note it will also be necessary to
     add a rule to the makefile fragment pointed to by 'tmake_file' that
     shows how to build this object file.

 -- Macro: HANDLE_PRAGMA_PACK_WITH_EXPANSION
     Define this macro if macros should be expanded in the arguments of
     '#pragma pack'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_DEFAULT_PACK_STRUCT
     If your target requires a structure packing default other than 0
     (meaning the machine default), define this macro to the necessary
     value (in bytes).  This must be a value that would also be valid to
     use with '#pragma pack()' (that is, a small power of two).

 -- Macro: DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS
     Define this macro to control use of the character '$' in identifier
     names for the C family of languages.  0 means '$' is not allowed by
     default; 1 means it is allowed.  1 is the default; there is no need
     to define this macro in that case.

 -- Macro: INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to use a resource set or
     clobbered in INSN.  INSN is always a 'jump_insn' or an 'insn'; GCC
     knows that every 'call_insn' has this behavior.  On machines where
     some 'insn' or 'jump_insn' is really a function call and hence has
     this behavior, you should define this macro.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

 -- Macro: INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to set or clobber a resource
     referenced in INSN.  INSN is always a 'jump_insn' or an 'insn'.  On
     machines where some 'insn' or 'jump_insn' is really a function call
     and its operands are registers whose use is actually in the
     subroutine it calls, you should define this macro.  Doing so allows
     the delay slot scheduler to move instructions which copy arguments
     into the argument registers into the delay slot of INSN.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

 -- Macro: MULTIPLE_SYMBOL_SPACES
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if, in some
     cases, global symbols from one translation unit may not be bound to
     undefined symbols in another translation unit without user
     intervention.  For instance, under Microsoft Windows symbols must
     be explicitly imported from shared libraries (DLLs).

     You need not define this macro if it would always evaluate to zero.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_MD_ASM_CLOBBERS (tree OUTPUTS, tree INPUTS,
          tree CLOBBERS)
     This target hook should add to CLOBBERS 'STRING_CST' trees for any
     hard regs the port wishes to automatically clobber for an asm.  It
     should return the result of the last 'tree_cons' used to add a
     clobber.  The OUTPUTS, INPUTS and CLOBBER lists are the
     corresponding parameters to the asm and may be inspected to avoid
     clobbering a register that is an input or output of the asm.  You
     can use 'tree_overlaps_hard_reg_set', declared in 'tree.h', to test
     for overlap with regards to asm-declared registers.

 -- Macro: MATH_LIBRARY
     Define this macro as a C string constant for the linker argument to
     link in the system math library, minus the initial '"-l"', or '""'
     if the target does not have a separate math library.

     You need only define this macro if the default of '"m"' is wrong.

 -- Macro: LIBRARY_PATH_ENV
     Define this macro as a C string constant for the environment
     variable that specifies where the linker should look for libraries.

     You need only define this macro if the default of '"LIBRARY_PATH"'
     is wrong.

 -- Macro: TARGET_POSIX_IO
     Define this macro if the target supports the following POSIX file
     functions, access, mkdir and file locking with fcntl / F_SETLKW.
     Defining 'TARGET_POSIX_IO' will enable the test coverage code to
     use file locking when exiting a program, which avoids race
     conditions if the program has forked.  It will also create
     directories at run-time for cross-profiling.

 -- Macro: MAX_CONDITIONAL_EXECUTE

     A C expression for the maximum number of instructions to execute
     via conditional execution instructions instead of a branch.  A
     value of 'BRANCH_COST'+1 is the default if the machine does not use
     cc0, and 1 if it does use cc0.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_TESTS (CE_INFO, TRUE_EXPR, FALSE_EXPR)
     Used if the target needs to perform machine-dependent modifications
     on the conditionals used for turning basic blocks into
     conditionally executed code.  CE_INFO points to a data structure,
     'struct ce_if_block', which contains information about the
     currently processed blocks.  TRUE_EXPR and FALSE_EXPR are the tests
     that are used for converting the then-block and the else-block,
     respectively.  Set either TRUE_EXPR or FALSE_EXPR to a null pointer
     if the tests cannot be converted.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_MULTIPLE_TESTS (CE_INFO, BB, TRUE_EXPR,
          FALSE_EXPR)
     Like 'IFCVT_MODIFY_TESTS', but used when converting more
     complicated if-statements into conditions combined by 'and' and
     'or' operations.  BB contains the basic block that contains the
     test that is currently being processed and about to be turned into
     a condition.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_INSN (CE_INFO, PATTERN, INSN)
     A C expression to modify the PATTERN of an INSN that is to be
     converted to conditional execution format.  CE_INFO points to a
     data structure, 'struct ce_if_block', which contains information
     about the currently processed blocks.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_FINAL (CE_INFO)
     A C expression to perform any final machine dependent modifications
     in converting code to conditional execution.  The involved basic
     blocks can be found in the 'struct ce_if_block' structure that is
     pointed to by CE_INFO.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MODIFY_CANCEL (CE_INFO)
     A C expression to cancel any machine dependent modifications in
     converting code to conditional execution.  The involved basic
     blocks can be found in the 'struct ce_if_block' structure that is
     pointed to by CE_INFO.

 -- Macro: IFCVT_MACHDEP_INIT (CE_INFO)
     A C expression to initialize any machine specific data for
     if-conversion of the if-block in the 'struct ce_if_block' structure
     that is pointed to by CE_INFO.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG (void)
     If non-null, this hook performs a target-specific pass over the
     instruction stream.  The compiler will run it at all optimization
     levels, just before the point at which it normally does
     delayed-branch scheduling.

     The exact purpose of the hook varies from target to target.  Some
     use it to do transformations that are necessary for correctness,
     such as laying out in-function constant pools or avoiding hardware
     hazards.  Others use it as an opportunity to do some
     machine-dependent optimizations.

     You need not implement the hook if it has nothing to do.  The
     default definition is null.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS (void)
     Define this hook if you have any machine-specific built-in
     functions that need to be defined.  It should be a function that
     performs the necessary setup.

     Machine specific built-in functions can be useful to expand special
     machine instructions that would otherwise not normally be generated
     because they have no equivalent in the source language (for
     example, SIMD vector instructions or prefetch instructions).

     To create a built-in function, call the function
     'lang_hooks.builtin_function' which is defined by the language
     front end.  You can use any type nodes set up by
     'build_common_tree_nodes'; only language front ends that use those
     two functions will call 'TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_BUILTIN_DECL (unsigned CODE, bool
          INITIALIZE_P)
     Define this hook if you have any machine-specific built-in
     functions that need to be defined.  It should be a function that
     returns the builtin function declaration for the builtin function
     code CODE.  If there is no such builtin and it cannot be
     initialized at this time if INITIALIZE_P is true the function
     should return 'NULL_TREE'.  If CODE is out of range the function
     should return 'error_mark_node'.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_EXPAND_BUILTIN (tree EXP, rtx TARGET, rtx
          SUBTARGET, enum machine_mode MODE, int IGNORE)

     Expand a call to a machine specific built-in function that was set
     up by 'TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.  EXP is the expression for the
     function call; the result should go to TARGET if that is
     convenient, and have mode MODE if that is convenient.  SUBTARGET
     may be used as the target for computing one of EXP's operands.
     IGNORE is nonzero if the value is to be ignored.  This function
     should return the result of the call to the built-in function.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_RESOLVE_OVERLOADED_BUILTIN (unsigned int
          LOC, tree FNDECL, void *ARGLIST)
     Select a replacement for a machine specific built-in function that
     was set up by 'TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.  This is done _before_
     regular type checking, and so allows the target to implement a
     crude form of function overloading.  FNDECL is the declaration of
     the built-in function.  ARGLIST is the list of arguments passed to
     the built-in function.  The result is a complete expression that
     implements the operation, usually another 'CALL_EXPR'.  ARGLIST
     really has type 'VEC(tree,gc)*'

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_FOLD_BUILTIN (tree FNDECL, int N_ARGS, tree
          *ARGP, bool IGNORE)
     Fold a call to a machine specific built-in function that was set up
     by 'TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.  FNDECL is the declaration of the
     built-in function.  N_ARGS is the number of arguments passed to the
     function; the arguments themselves are pointed to by ARGP.  The
     result is another tree, valid for both GIMPLE and GENERIC,
     containing a simplified expression for the call's result.  If
     IGNORE is true the value will be ignored.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_GIMPLE_FOLD_BUILTIN (gimple_stmt_iterator
          *GSI)
     Fold a call to a machine specific built-in function that was set up
     by 'TARGET_INIT_BUILTINS'.  GSI points to the gimple statement
     holding the function call.  Returns true if any change was made to
     the GIMPLE stream.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_COMPARE_VERSION_PRIORITY (tree DECL1, tree
          DECL2)
     This hook is used to compare the target attributes in two functions
     to determine which function's features get higher priority.  This
     is used during function multi-versioning to figure out the order in
     which two versions must be dispatched.  A function version with a
     higher priority is checked for dispatching earlier.  DECL1 and
     DECL2 are the two function decls that will be compared.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_GET_FUNCTION_VERSIONS_DISPATCHER (void
          *DECL)
     This hook is used to get the dispatcher function for a set of
     function versions.  The dispatcher function is called to invoke the
     right function version at run-time.  DECL is one version from a set
     of semantically identical versions.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_GENERATE_VERSION_DISPATCHER_BODY (void
          *ARG)
     This hook is used to generate the dispatcher logic to invoke the
     right function version at run-time for a given set of function
     versions.  ARG points to the callgraph node of the dispatcher
     function whose body must be generated.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CAN_USE_DOLOOP_P (double_int ITERATIONS,
          double_int ITERATIONS_MAX, unsigned int LOOP_DEPTH, bool
          ENTERED_AT_TOP)
     Return true if it is possible to use low-overhead loops
     ('doloop_end' and 'doloop_begin') for a particular loop.
     ITERATIONS gives the exact number of iterations, or 0 if not known.
     ITERATIONS_MAX gives the maximum number of iterations, or 0 if not
     known.  LOOP_DEPTH is the nesting depth of the loop, with 1 for
     innermost loops, 2 for loops that contain innermost loops, and so
     on.  ENTERED_AT_TOP is true if the loop is only entered from the
     top.

     This hook is only used if 'doloop_end' is available.  The default
     implementation returns true.  You can use
     'can_use_doloop_if_innermost' if the loop must be the innermost,
     and if there are no other restrictions.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_WITHIN_DOLOOP (const_rtx
          INSN)

     Take an instruction in INSN and return NULL if it is valid within a
     low-overhead loop, otherwise return a string explaining why doloop
     could not be applied.

     Many targets use special registers for low-overhead looping.  For
     any instruction that clobbers these this function should return a
     string indicating the reason why the doloop could not be applied.
     By default, the RTL loop optimizer does not use a present doloop
     pattern for loops containing function calls or branch on table
     instructions.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_LEGITIMATE_COMBINED_INSN (rtx INSN)
     Take an instruction in INSN and return 'false' if the instruction
     is not appropriate as a combination of two or more instructions.
     The default is to accept all instructions.

 -- Macro: MD_CAN_REDIRECT_BRANCH (BRANCH1, BRANCH2)

     Take a branch insn in BRANCH1 and another in BRANCH2.  Return true
     if redirecting BRANCH1 to the destination of BRANCH2 is possible.

     On some targets, branches may have a limited range.  Optimizing the
     filling of delay slots can result in branches being redirected, and
     this may in turn cause a branch offset to overflow.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CAN_FOLLOW_JUMP (const_rtx FOLLOWER,
          const_rtx FOLLOWEE)
     FOLLOWER and FOLLOWEE are JUMP_INSN instructions; return true if
     FOLLOWER may be modified to follow FOLLOWEE; false, if it can't.
     For example, on some targets, certain kinds of branches can't be
     made to follow through a hot/cold partitioning.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_COMMUTATIVE_P (const_rtx X, int OUTER_CODE)
     This target hook returns 'true' if X is considered to be
     commutative.  Usually, this is just COMMUTATIVE_P (X), but the HP
     PA doesn't consider PLUS to be commutative inside a MEM.
     OUTER_CODE is the rtx code of the enclosing rtl, if known,
     otherwise it is UNKNOWN.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_ALLOCATE_INITIAL_VALUE (rtx HARD_REG)

     When the initial value of a hard register has been copied in a
     pseudo register, it is often not necessary to actually allocate
     another register to this pseudo register, because the original hard
     register or a stack slot it has been saved into can be used.
     'TARGET_ALLOCATE_INITIAL_VALUE' is called at the start of register
     allocation once for each hard register that had its initial value
     copied by using 'get_func_hard_reg_initial_val' or
     'get_hard_reg_initial_val'.  Possible values are 'NULL_RTX', if you
     don't want to do any special allocation, a 'REG' rtx--that would
     typically be the hard register itself, if it is known not to be
     clobbered--or a 'MEM'.  If you are returning a 'MEM', this is only
     a hint for the allocator; it might decide to use another register
     anyways.  You may use 'current_function_is_leaf' or 'REG_N_SETS' in
     the hook to determine if the hard register in question will not be
     clobbered.  The default value of this hook is 'NULL', which
     disables any special allocation.

 -- Target Hook: int TARGET_UNSPEC_MAY_TRAP_P (const_rtx X, unsigned
          FLAGS)
     This target hook returns nonzero if X, an 'unspec' or
     'unspec_volatile' operation, might cause a trap.  Targets can use
     this hook to enhance precision of analysis for 'unspec' and
     'unspec_volatile' operations.  You may call 'may_trap_p_1' to
     analyze inner elements of X in which case FLAGS should be passed
     along.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_SET_CURRENT_FUNCTION (tree DECL)
     The compiler invokes this hook whenever it changes its current
     function context ('cfun').  You can define this function if the
     back end needs to perform any initialization or reset actions on a
     per-function basis.  For example, it may be used to implement
     function attributes that affect register usage or code generation
     patterns.  The argument DECL is the declaration for the new
     function context, and may be null to indicate that the compiler has
     left a function context and is returning to processing at the top
     level.  The default hook function does nothing.

     GCC sets 'cfun' to a dummy function context during initialization
     of some parts of the back end.  The hook function is not invoked in
     this situation; you need not worry about the hook being invoked
     recursively, or when the back end is in a partially-initialized
     state.  'cfun' might be 'NULL' to indicate processing at top level,
     outside of any function scope.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OBJECT_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     object files on your target machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GCC will use '.o' as the suffix for object files.

 -- Macro: TARGET_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix to be
     automatically added to executable files on your target machine.  If
     you do not define this macro, GCC will use the null string as the
     suffix for executable files.

 -- Macro: COLLECT_EXPORT_LIST
     If defined, 'collect2' will scan the individual object files
     specified on its command line and create an export list for the
     linker.  Define this macro for systems like AIX, where the linker
     discards object files that are not referenced from 'main' and uses
     export lists.

 -- Macro: MODIFY_JNI_METHOD_CALL (MDECL)
     Define this macro to a C expression representing a variant of the
     method call MDECL, if Java Native Interface (JNI) methods must be
     invoked differently from other methods on your target.  For
     example, on 32-bit Microsoft Windows, JNI methods must be invoked
     using the 'stdcall' calling convention and this macro is then
     defined as this expression:

          build_type_attribute_variant (MDECL,
                                        build_tree_list
                                        (get_identifier ("stdcall"),
                                         NULL))

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_CANNOT_MODIFY_JUMPS_P (void)
     This target hook returns 'true' past the point in which new jump
     instructions could be created.  On machines that require a register
     for every jump such as the SHmedia ISA of SH5, this point would
     typically be reload, so this target hook should be defined to a
     function such as:

          static bool
          cannot_modify_jumps_past_reload_p ()
          {
            return (reload_completed || reload_in_progress);
          }

 -- Target Hook: reg_class_t TARGET_BRANCH_TARGET_REGISTER_CLASS (void)
     This target hook returns a register class for which branch target
     register optimizations should be applied.  All registers in this
     class should be usable interchangeably.  After reload, registers in
     this class will be re-allocated and loads will be hoisted out of
     loops and be subjected to inter-block scheduling.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_BRANCH_TARGET_REGISTER_CALLEE_SAVED (bool
          AFTER_PROLOGUE_EPILOGUE_GEN)
     Branch target register optimization will by default exclude
     callee-saved registers that are not already live during the current
     function; if this target hook returns true, they will be included.
     The target code must than make sure that all target registers in
     the class returned by 'TARGET_BRANCH_TARGET_REGISTER_CLASS' that
     might need saving are saved.  AFTER_PROLOGUE_EPILOGUE_GEN indicates
     if prologues and epilogues have already been generated.  Note, even
     if you only return true when AFTER_PROLOGUE_EPILOGUE_GEN is false,
     you still are likely to have to make special provisions in
     'INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET' to reserve space for caller-saved
     target registers.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAVE_CONDITIONAL_EXECUTION (void)
     This target hook returns true if the target supports conditional
     execution.  This target hook is required only when the target has
     several different modes and they have different conditional
     execution capability, such as ARM.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned TARGET_LOOP_UNROLL_ADJUST (unsigned NUNROLL,
          struct loop *LOOP)
     This target hook returns a new value for the number of times LOOP
     should be unrolled.  The parameter NUNROLL is the number of times
     the loop is to be unrolled.  The parameter LOOP is a pointer to the
     loop, which is going to be checked for unrolling.  This target hook
     is required only when the target has special constraints like
     maximum number of memory accesses.

 -- Macro: POWI_MAX_MULTS
     If defined, this macro is interpreted as a signed integer C
     expression that specifies the maximum number of floating point
     multiplications that should be emitted when expanding
     exponentiation by an integer constant inline.  When this value is
     defined, exponentiation requiring more than this number of
     multiplications is implemented by calling the system library's
     'pow', 'powf' or 'powl' routines.  The default value places no
     upper bound on the multiplication count.

 -- Macro: void TARGET_EXTRA_INCLUDES (const char *SYSROOT, const char
          *IPREFIX, int STDINC)
     This target hook should register any extra include files for the
     target.  The parameter STDINC indicates if normal include files are
     present.  The parameter SYSROOT is the system root directory.  The
     parameter IPREFIX is the prefix for the gcc directory.

 -- Macro: void TARGET_EXTRA_PRE_INCLUDES (const char *SYSROOT, const
          char *IPREFIX, int STDINC)
     This target hook should register any extra include files for the
     target before any standard headers.  The parameter STDINC indicates
     if normal include files are present.  The parameter SYSROOT is the
     system root directory.  The parameter IPREFIX is the prefix for the
     gcc directory.

 -- Macro: void TARGET_OPTF (char *PATH)
     This target hook should register special include paths for the
     target.  The parameter PATH is the include to register.  On Darwin
     systems, this is used for Framework includes, which have semantics
     that are different from '-I'.

 -- Macro: bool TARGET_USE_LOCAL_THUNK_ALIAS_P (tree FNDECL)
     This target macro returns 'true' if it is safe to use a local alias
     for a virtual function FNDECL when constructing thunks, 'false'
     otherwise.  By default, the macro returns 'true' for all functions,
     if a target supports aliases (i.e. defines 'ASM_OUTPUT_DEF'),
     'false' otherwise,

 -- Macro: TARGET_FORMAT_TYPES
     If defined, this macro is the name of a global variable containing
     target-specific format checking information for the '-Wformat'
     option.  The default is to have no target-specific format checks.

 -- Macro: TARGET_N_FORMAT_TYPES
     If defined, this macro is the number of entries in
     'TARGET_FORMAT_TYPES'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OVERRIDES_FORMAT_ATTRIBUTES
     If defined, this macro is the name of a global variable containing
     target-specific format overrides for the '-Wformat' option.  The
     default is to have no target-specific format overrides.  If
     defined, 'TARGET_FORMAT_TYPES' must be defined, too.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OVERRIDES_FORMAT_ATTRIBUTES_COUNT
     If defined, this macro specifies the number of entries in
     'TARGET_OVERRIDES_FORMAT_ATTRIBUTES'.

 -- Macro: TARGET_OVERRIDES_FORMAT_INIT
     If defined, this macro specifies the optional initialization
     routine for target specific customizations of the system printf and
     scanf formatter settings.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_RELAXED_ORDERING
     If set to 'true', means that the target's memory model does not
     guarantee that loads which do not depend on one another will access
     main memory in the order of the instruction stream; if ordering is
     important, an explicit memory barrier must be used.  This is true
     of many recent processors which implement a policy of "relaxed,"
     "weak," or "release" memory consistency, such as Alpha, PowerPC,
     and ia64.  The default is 'false'.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_ARG_FOR_UNPROTOTYPED_FN
          (const_tree TYPELIST, const_tree FUNCDECL, const_tree VAL)
     If defined, this macro returns the diagnostic message when it is
     illegal to pass argument VAL to function FUNCDECL with prototype
     TYPELIST.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_CONVERSION (const_tree
          FROMTYPE, const_tree TOTYPE)
     If defined, this macro returns the diagnostic message when it is
     invalid to convert from FROMTYPE to TOTYPE, or 'NULL' if validity
     should be determined by the front end.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_UNARY_OP (int OP,
          const_tree TYPE)
     If defined, this macro returns the diagnostic message when it is
     invalid to apply operation OP (where unary plus is denoted by
     'CONVERT_EXPR') to an operand of type TYPE, or 'NULL' if validity
     should be determined by the front end.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_BINARY_OP (int OP,
          const_tree TYPE1, const_tree TYPE2)
     If defined, this macro returns the diagnostic message when it is
     invalid to apply operation OP to operands of types TYPE1 and TYPE2,
     or 'NULL' if validity should be determined by the front end.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_PARAMETER_TYPE (const_tree
          TYPE)
     If defined, this macro returns the diagnostic message when it is
     invalid for functions to include parameters of type TYPE, or 'NULL'
     if validity should be determined by the front end.  This is
     currently used only by the C and C++ front ends.

 -- Target Hook: const char * TARGET_INVALID_RETURN_TYPE (const_tree
          TYPE)
     If defined, this macro returns the diagnostic message when it is
     invalid for functions to have return type TYPE, or 'NULL' if
     validity should be determined by the front end.  This is currently
     used only by the C and C++ front ends.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_PROMOTED_TYPE (const_tree TYPE)
     If defined, this target hook returns the type to which values of
     TYPE should be promoted when they appear in expressions, analogous
     to the integer promotions, or 'NULL_TREE' to use the front end's
     normal promotion rules.  This hook is useful when there are
     target-specific types with special promotion rules.  This is
     currently used only by the C and C++ front ends.

 -- Target Hook: tree TARGET_CONVERT_TO_TYPE (tree TYPE, tree EXPR)
     If defined, this hook returns the result of converting EXPR to
     TYPE.  It should return the converted expression, or 'NULL_TREE' to
     apply the front end's normal conversion rules.  This hook is useful
     when there are target-specific types with special conversion rules.
     This is currently used only by the C and C++ front ends.

 -- Macro: TARGET_USE_JCR_SECTION
     This macro determines whether to use the JCR section to register
     Java classes.  By default, TARGET_USE_JCR_SECTION is defined to 1
     if both SUPPORTS_WEAK and TARGET_HAVE_NAMED_SECTIONS are true, else
     0.

 -- Macro: OBJC_JBLEN
     This macro determines the size of the objective C jump buffer for
     the NeXT runtime.  By default, OBJC_JBLEN is defined to an
     innocuous value.

 -- Macro: LIBGCC2_UNWIND_ATTRIBUTE
     Define this macro if any target-specific attributes need to be
     attached to the functions in 'libgcc' that provide low-level
     support for call stack unwinding.  It is used in declarations in
     'unwind-generic.h' and the associated definitions of those
     functions.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_UPDATE_STACK_BOUNDARY (void)
     Define this macro to update the current function stack boundary if
     necessary.

 -- Target Hook: rtx TARGET_GET_DRAP_RTX (void)
     This hook should return an rtx for Dynamic Realign Argument Pointer
     (DRAP) if a different argument pointer register is needed to access
     the function's argument list due to stack realignment.  Return
     'NULL' if no DRAP is needed.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_ALLOCATE_STACK_SLOTS_FOR_ARGS (void)
     When optimization is disabled, this hook indicates whether or not
     arguments should be allocated to stack slots.  Normally, GCC
     allocates stacks slots for arguments when not optimizing in order
     to make debugging easier.  However, when a function is declared
     with '__attribute__((naked))', there is no stack frame, and the
     compiler cannot safely move arguments from the registers in which
     they are passed to the stack.  Therefore, this hook should return
     true in general, but false for naked functions.  The default
     implementation always returns true.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR
     On some architectures it can take multiple instructions to
     synthesize a constant.  If there is another constant already in a
     register that is close enough in value then it is preferable that
     the new constant is computed from this register using immediate
     addition or subtraction.  We accomplish this through CSE. Besides
     the value of the constant we also add a lower and an upper constant
     anchor to the available expressions.  These are then queried when
     encountering new constants.  The anchors are computed by rounding
     the constant up and down to a multiple of the value of
     'TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR'.  'TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR' should be the maximum
     positive value accepted by immediate-add plus one.  We currently
     assume that the value of 'TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR' is a power of 2.
     For example, on MIPS, where add-immediate takes a 16-bit signed
     value, 'TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR' is set to '0x8000'.  The default value
     is zero, which disables this optimization.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_ASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET (void)
     Return the offset bitwise ored into shifted address to get
     corresponding Address Sanitizer shadow memory address.  NULL if
     Address Sanitizer is not supported by the target.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT TARGET_MEMMODEL_CHECK (unsigned
          HOST_WIDE_INT VAL)
     Validate target specific memory model mask bits.  When NULL no
     target specific memory model bits are allowed.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned char TARGET_ATOMIC_TEST_AND_SET_TRUEVAL
     This value should be set if the result written by
     'atomic_test_and_set' is not exactly 1, i.e.  the 'bool' 'true'.

 -- Target Hook: bool TARGET_HAS_IFUNC_P (void)
     It returns true if the target supports GNU indirect functions.  The
     support includes the assembler, linker and dynamic linker.  The
     default value of this hook is based on target's libc.

 -- Target Hook: unsigned int TARGET_ATOMIC_ALIGN_FOR_MODE (enum
          machine_mode MODE)
     If defined, this function returns an appropriate alignment in bits
     for an atomic object of machine_mode MODE.  If 0 is returned then
     the default alignment for the specified mode is used.

 -- Target Hook: void TARGET_ATOMIC_ASSIGN_EXPAND_FENV (tree *HOLD, tree
          *CLEAR, tree *UPDATE)
     ISO C11 requires atomic compound assignments that may raise
     floating-point exceptions to raise exceptions corresponding to the
     arithmetic operation whose result was successfully stored in a
     compare-and-exchange sequence.  This requires code equivalent to
     calls to 'feholdexcept', 'feclearexcept' and 'feupdateenv' to be
     generated at appropriate points in the compare-and-exchange
     sequence.  This hook should set '*HOLD' to an expression equivalent
     to the call to 'feholdexcept', '*CLEAR' to an expression equivalent
     to the call to 'feclearexcept' and '*UPDATE' to an expression
     equivalent to the call to 'feupdateenv'.  The three expressions are
     'NULL_TREE' on entry to the hook and may be left as 'NULL_TREE' if
     no code is required in a particular place.  The default
     implementation leaves all three expressions as 'NULL_TREE'.  The
     '__atomic_feraiseexcept' function from 'libatomic' may be of use as
     part of the code generated in '*UPDATE'.

18 Host Configuration
*********************

Most details about the machine and system on which the compiler is
actually running are detected by the 'configure' script.  Some things
are impossible for 'configure' to detect; these are described in two
ways, either by macros defined in a file named 'xm-MACHINE.h' or by hook
functions in the file specified by the OUT_HOST_HOOK_OBJ variable in
'config.gcc'.  (The intention is that very few hosts will need a header
file but nearly every fully supported host will need to override some
hooks.)

 If you need to define only a few macros, and they have simple
definitions, consider using the 'xm_defines' variable in your
'config.gcc' entry instead of creating a host configuration header.
*Note System Config::.

* Menu:

* Host Common::         Things every host probably needs implemented.
* Filesystem::          Your host can't have the letter 'a' in filenames?
* Host Misc::           Rare configuration options for hosts.

18.1 Host Common
================

Some things are just not portable, even between similar operating
systems, and are too difficult for autoconf to detect.  They get
implemented using hook functions in the file specified by the
HOST_HOOK_OBJ variable in 'config.gcc'.

 -- Host Hook: void HOST_HOOKS_EXTRA_SIGNALS (void)
     This host hook is used to set up handling for extra signals.  The
     most common thing to do in this hook is to detect stack overflow.

 -- Host Hook: void * HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_GET_ADDRESS (size_t SIZE, int
          FD)
     This host hook returns the address of some space that is likely to
     be free in some subsequent invocation of the compiler.  We intend
     to load the PCH data at this address such that the data need not be
     relocated.  The area should be able to hold SIZE bytes.  If the
     host uses 'mmap', FD is an open file descriptor that can be used
     for probing.

 -- Host Hook: int HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_USE_ADDRESS (void * ADDRESS, size_t
          SIZE, int FD, size_t OFFSET)
     This host hook is called when a PCH file is about to be loaded.  We
     want to load SIZE bytes from FD at OFFSET into memory at ADDRESS.
     The given address will be the result of a previous invocation of
     'HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_GET_ADDRESS'.  Return -1 if we couldn't allocate
     SIZE bytes at ADDRESS.  Return 0 if the memory is allocated but the
     data is not loaded.  Return 1 if the hook has performed everything.

     If the implementation uses reserved address space, free any
     reserved space beyond SIZE, regardless of the return value.  If no
     PCH will be loaded, this hook may be called with SIZE zero, in
     which case all reserved address space should be freed.

     Do not try to handle values of ADDRESS that could not have been
     returned by this executable; just return -1.  Such values usually
     indicate an out-of-date PCH file (built by some other GCC
     executable), and such a PCH file won't work.

 -- Host Hook: size_t HOST_HOOKS_GT_PCH_ALLOC_GRANULARITY (void);
     This host hook returns the alignment required for allocating
     virtual memory.  Usually this is the same as getpagesize, but on
     some hosts the alignment for reserving memory differs from the
     pagesize for committing memory.

18.2 Host Filesystem
====================

GCC needs to know a number of things about the semantics of the host
machine's filesystem.  Filesystems with Unix and MS-DOS semantics are
automatically detected.  For other systems, you can define the following
macros in 'xm-MACHINE.h'.

'HAVE_DOS_BASED_FILE_SYSTEM'
     This macro is automatically defined by 'system.h' if the host file
     system obeys the semantics defined by MS-DOS instead of Unix.  DOS
     file systems are case insensitive, file specifications may begin
     with a drive letter, and both forward slash and backslash ('/' and
     '\') are directory separators.

'DIR_SEPARATOR'
'DIR_SEPARATOR_2'
     If defined, these macros expand to character constants specifying
     separators for directory names within a file specification.
     'system.h' will automatically give them appropriate values on Unix
     and MS-DOS file systems.  If your file system is neither of these,
     define one or both appropriately in 'xm-MACHINE.h'.

     However, operating systems like VMS, where constructing a pathname
     is more complicated than just stringing together directory names
     separated by a special character, should not define either of these
     macros.

'PATH_SEPARATOR'
     If defined, this macro should expand to a character constant
     specifying the separator for elements of search paths.  The default
     value is a colon (':').  DOS-based systems usually, but not always,
     use semicolon (';').

'VMS'
     Define this macro if the host system is VMS.

'HOST_OBJECT_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     object files on your host machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GCC will use '.o' as the suffix for object files.

'HOST_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     executable files on your host machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GCC will use the null string as the suffix for executable
     files.

'HOST_BIT_BUCKET'
     A pathname defined by the host operating system, which can be
     opened as a file and written to, but all the information written is
     discarded.  This is commonly known as a "bit bucket" or "null
     device".  If you do not define this macro, GCC will use '/dev/null'
     as the bit bucket.  If the host does not support a bit bucket,
     define this macro to an invalid filename.

'UPDATE_PATH_HOST_CANONICALIZE (PATH)'
     If defined, a C statement (sans semicolon) that performs
     host-dependent canonicalization when a path used in a compilation
     driver or preprocessor is canonicalized.  PATH is a malloc-ed path
     to be canonicalized.  If the C statement does canonicalize PATH
     into a different buffer, the old path should be freed and the new
     buffer should have been allocated with malloc.

'DUMPFILE_FORMAT'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the format to use
     for constructing the index part of debugging dump file names.  The
     resultant string must fit in fifteen bytes.  The full filename will
     be the concatenation of: the prefix of the assembler file name, the
     string resulting from applying this format to an index number, and
     a string unique to each dump file kind, e.g. 'rtl'.

     If you do not define this macro, GCC will use '.%02d.'.  You should
     define this macro if using the default will create an invalid file
     name.

'DELETE_IF_ORDINARY'
     Define this macro to be a C statement (sans semicolon) that
     performs host-dependent removal of ordinary temp files in the
     compilation driver.

     If you do not define this macro, GCC will use the default version.
     You should define this macro if the default version does not
     reliably remove the temp file as, for example, on VMS which allows
     multiple versions of a file.

'HOST_LACKS_INODE_NUMBERS'
     Define this macro if the host filesystem does not report meaningful
     inode numbers in struct stat.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Host Misc,  Prev: Filesystem,  Up: Host Config

18.3 Host Misc
==============

'FATAL_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits after serious errors.  The default is the system-provided
     macro 'EXIT_FAILURE', or '1' if the system doesn't define that
     macro.  Define this macro only if these defaults are incorrect.

'SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits without serious errors.  (Warnings are not serious errors.)
     The default is the system-provided macro 'EXIT_SUCCESS', or '0' if
     the system doesn't define that macro.  Define this macro only if
     these defaults are incorrect.

'USE_C_ALLOCA'
     Define this macro if GCC should use the C implementation of
     'alloca' provided by 'libiberty.a'.  This only affects how some
     parts of the compiler itself allocate memory.  It does not change
     code generation.

     When GCC is built with a compiler other than itself, the C 'alloca'
     is always used.  This is because most other implementations have
     serious bugs.  You should define this macro only on a system where
     no stack-based 'alloca' can possibly work.  For instance, if a
     system has a small limit on the size of the stack, GCC's builtin
     'alloca' will not work reliably.

'COLLECT2_HOST_INITIALIZATION'
     If defined, a C statement (sans semicolon) that performs
     host-dependent initialization when 'collect2' is being initialized.

'GCC_DRIVER_HOST_INITIALIZATION'
     If defined, a C statement (sans semicolon) that performs
     host-dependent initialization when a compilation driver is being
     initialized.

'HOST_LONG_LONG_FORMAT'
     If defined, the string used to indicate an argument of type 'long
     long' to functions like 'printf'.  The default value is '"ll"'.

'HOST_LONG_FORMAT'
     If defined, the string used to indicate an argument of type 'long'
     to functions like 'printf'.  The default value is '"l"'.

'HOST_PTR_PRINTF'
     If defined, the string used to indicate an argument of type 'void
     *' to functions like 'printf'.  The default value is '"%p"'.

 In addition, if 'configure' generates an incorrect definition of any of
the macros in 'auto-host.h', you can override that definition in a host
configuration header.  If you need to do this, first see if it is
possible to fix 'configure'.

19 Makefile Fragments
*********************

When you configure GCC using the 'configure' script, it will construct
the file 'Makefile' from the template file 'Makefile.in'.  When it does
this, it can incorporate makefile fragments from the 'config' directory.
These are used to set Makefile parameters that are not amenable to being
calculated by autoconf.  The list of fragments to incorporate is set by
'config.gcc' (and occasionally 'config.build' and 'config.host'); *Note
System Config::.

 Fragments are named either 't-TARGET' or 'x-HOST', depending on whether
they are relevant to configuring GCC to produce code for a particular
target, or to configuring GCC to run on a particular host.  Here TARGET
and HOST are mnemonics which usually have some relationship to the
canonical system name, but no formal connection.

 If these files do not exist, it means nothing needs to be added for a
given target or host.  Most targets need a few 't-TARGET' fragments, but
needing 'x-HOST' fragments is rare.

* Menu:

* Target Fragment:: Writing 't-TARGET' files.
* Host Fragment::   Writing 'x-HOST' files.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Target Fragment,  Next: Host Fragment,  Up: Fragments

19.1 Target Makefile Fragments
==============================

Target makefile fragments can set these Makefile variables.

'LIBGCC2_CFLAGS'
     Compiler flags to use when compiling 'libgcc2.c'.

'LIB2FUNCS_EXTRA'
     A list of source file names to be compiled or assembled and
     inserted into 'libgcc.a'.

'CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS'
     Special flags used when compiling 'crtstuff.c'.  *Note
     Initialization::.

'CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS_S'
     Special flags used when compiling 'crtstuff.c' for shared linking.
     Used if you use 'crtbeginS.o' and 'crtendS.o' in 'EXTRA-PARTS'.
     *Note Initialization::.

'MULTILIB_OPTIONS'
     For some targets, invoking GCC in different ways produces objects
     that can not be linked together.  For example, for some targets GCC
     produces both big and little endian code.  For these targets, you
     must arrange for multiple versions of 'libgcc.a' to be compiled,
     one for each set of incompatible options.  When GCC invokes the
     linker, it arranges to link in the right version of 'libgcc.a',
     based on the command line options used.

     The 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' macro lists the set of options for which
     special versions of 'libgcc.a' must be built.  Write options that
     are mutually incompatible side by side, separated by a slash.
     Write options that may be used together separated by a space.  The
     build procedure will build all combinations of compatible options.

     For example, if you set 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' to 'm68000/m68020
     msoft-float', 'Makefile' will build special versions of 'libgcc.a'
     using the following sets of options: '-m68000', '-m68020',
     '-msoft-float', '-m68000 -msoft-float', and '-m68020 -msoft-float'.

'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES'
     If 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is used, this variable specifies the
     directory names that should be used to hold the various libraries.
     Write one element in 'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' for each element in
     'MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.  If 'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is not used, the
     default value will be 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS', with all slashes treated
     as spaces.

     'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' describes the multilib directories using GCC
     conventions and is applied to directories that are part of the GCC
     installation.  When multilib-enabled, the compiler will add a
     subdirectory of the form PREFIX/MULTILIB before each directory in
     the search path for libraries and crt files.

     For example, if 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is set to 'm68000/m68020
     msoft-float', then the default value of 'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is
     'm68000 m68020 msoft-float'.  You may specify a different value if
     you desire a different set of directory names.

'MULTILIB_MATCHES'
     Sometimes the same option may be written in two different ways.  If
     an option is listed in 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS', GCC needs to know about
     any synonyms.  In that case, set 'MULTILIB_MATCHES' to a list of
     items of the form 'option=option' to describe all relevant
     synonyms.  For example, 'm68000=mc68000 m68020=mc68020'.

'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS'
     Sometimes when there are multiple sets of 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' being
     specified, there are combinations that should not be built.  In
     that case, set 'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' to be all of the switch
     exceptions in shell case syntax that should not be built.

     For example the ARM processor cannot execute both hardware floating
     point instructions and the reduced size THUMB instructions at the
     same time, so there is no need to build libraries with both of
     these options enabled.  Therefore 'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' is set to:
          *mthumb/*mhard-float*

'MULTILIB_REQUIRED'
     Sometimes when there are only a few combinations are required, it
     would be a big effort to come up with a 'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' list
     to cover all undesired ones.  In such a case, just listing all the
     required combinations in 'MULTILIB_REQUIRED' would be more
     straightforward.

     The way to specify the entries in 'MULTILIB_REQUIRED' is same with
     the way used for 'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS', only this time what are
     required will be specified.  Suppose there are multiple sets of
     'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' and only two combinations are required, one for
     ARMv7-M and one for ARMv7-R with hard floating-point ABI and FPU,
     the 'MULTILIB_REQUIRED' can be set to:
          MULTILIB_REQUIRED =  mthumb/march=armv7-m
          MULTILIB_REQUIRED += march=armv7-r/mfloat-abi=hard/mfpu=vfpv3-d16

     The 'MULTILIB_REQUIRED' can be used together with
     'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS'.  The option combinations generated from
     'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' will be filtered by 'MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS' and
     then by 'MULTILIB_REQUIRED'.

'MULTILIB_REUSE'
     Sometimes it is desirable to reuse one existing multilib for
     different sets of options.  Such kind of reuse can minimize the
     number of multilib variants.  And for some targets it is better to
     reuse an existing multilib than to fall back to default multilib
     when there is no corresponding multilib.  This can be done by
     adding reuse rules to 'MULTILIB_REUSE'.

     A reuse rule is comprised of two parts connected by equality sign.
     The left part is option set used to build multilib and the right
     part is option set that will reuse this multilib.  The order of
     options in the left part matters and should be same with those
     specified in 'MULTILIB_REQUIRED' or aligned with order in
     'MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.  There is no such limitation for options in
     right part as we don't build multilib from them.  But the equality
     sign in both parts should be replaced with period.

     The 'MULTILIB_REUSE' is different from 'MULTILIB_MATCHES' in that
     it sets up relations between two option sets rather than two
     options.  Here is an example to demo how we reuse libraries built
     in Thumb mode for applications built in ARM mode:
          MULTILIB_REUSE = mthumb/march.armv7-r=marm/march.armv7-r

     Before the advent of 'MULTILIB_REUSE', GCC select multilib by
     comparing command line options with options used to build multilib.
     The 'MULTILIB_REUSE' is complementary to that way.  Only when the
     original comparison matches nothing it will work to see if it is OK
     to reuse some existing multilib.

'MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS'
     Sometimes it is desirable that when building multiple versions of
     'libgcc.a' certain options should always be passed on to the
     compiler.  In that case, set 'MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS' to be the list
     of options to be used for all builds.  If you set this, you should
     probably set 'CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS' to a dash followed by it.

'MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES'
     If 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is used, this variable specifies a list of
     subdirectory names, that are used to modify the search path
     depending on the chosen multilib.  Unlike 'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES',
     'MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES' describes the multilib directories using
     operating systems conventions, and is applied to the directories
     such as 'lib' or those in the 'LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable.
     The format is either the same as of 'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES', or a set
     of mappings.  When it is the same as 'MULTILIB_DIRNAMES', it
     describes the multilib directories using operating system
     conventions, rather than GCC conventions.  When it is a set of
     mappings of the form GCCDIR=OSDIR, the left side gives the GCC
     convention and the right gives the equivalent OS defined location.
     If the OSDIR part begins with a '!', GCC will not search in the
     non-multilib directory and use exclusively the multilib directory.
     Otherwise, the compiler will examine the search path for libraries
     and crt files twice; the first time it will add MULTILIB to each
     directory in the search path, the second it will not.

     For configurations that support both multilib and multiarch,
     'MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES' also encodes the multiarch name, thus
     subsuming 'MULTIARCH_DIRNAME'.  The multiarch name is appended to
     each directory name, separated by a colon (e.g.
     '../lib32:i386-linux-gnu').

     Each multiarch subdirectory will be searched before the
     corresponding OS multilib directory, for example
     '/lib/i386-linux-gnu' before '/lib/../lib32'.  The multiarch name
     will also be used to modify the system header search path, as
     explained for 'MULTIARCH_DIRNAME'.

'MULTIARCH_DIRNAME'
     This variable specifies the multiarch name for configurations that
     are multiarch-enabled but not multilibbed configurations.

     The multiarch name is used to augment the search path for
     libraries, crt files and system header files with additional
     locations.  The compiler will add a multiarch subdirectory of the
     form PREFIX/MULTIARCH before each directory in the library and crt
     search path.  It will also add two directories
     'LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'/MULTIARCH and
     'NATIVE_SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR'/MULTIARCH) to the system header search
     path, respectively before 'LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR' and
     'NATIVE_SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR'.

     'MULTIARCH_DIRNAME' is not used for configurations that support
     both multilib and multiarch.  In that case, multiarch names are
     encoded in 'MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES' instead.

     More documentation about multiarch can be found at
     <http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch>.

'SPECS'
     Unfortunately, setting 'MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS' is not enough, since
     it does not affect the build of target libraries, at least not the
     build of the default multilib.  One possible work-around is to use
     'DRIVER_SELF_SPECS' to bring options from the 'specs' file as if
     they had been passed in the compiler driver command line.  However,
     you don't want to be adding these options after the toolchain is
     installed, so you can instead tweak the 'specs' file that will be
     used during the toolchain build, while you still install the
     original, built-in 'specs'.  The trick is to set 'SPECS' to some
     other filename (say 'specs.install'), that will then be created out
     of the built-in specs, and introduce a 'Makefile' rule to generate
     the 'specs' file that's going to be used at build time out of your
     'specs.install'.

'T_CFLAGS'
     These are extra flags to pass to the C compiler.  They are used
     both when building GCC, and when compiling things with the
     just-built GCC.  This variable is deprecated and should not be
     used.

19.2 Host Makefile Fragments
============================

The use of 'x-HOST' fragments is discouraged.  You should only use it
for makefile dependencies.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Collect2,  Next: Header Dirs,  Prev: Fragments,  Up: Top

20 'collect2'
*************

GCC uses a utility called 'collect2' on nearly all systems to arrange to
call various initialization functions at start time.

 The program 'collect2' works by linking the program once and looking
through the linker output file for symbols with particular names
indicating they are constructor functions.  If it finds any, it creates
a new temporary '.c' file containing a table of them, compiles it, and
links the program a second time including that file.

 The actual calls to the constructors are carried out by a subroutine
called '__main', which is called (automatically) at the beginning of the
body of 'main' (provided 'main' was compiled with GNU CC).  Calling
'__main' is necessary, even when compiling C code, to allow linking C
and C++ object code together.  (If you use '-nostdlib', you get an
unresolved reference to '__main', since it's defined in the standard GCC
library.  Include '-lgcc' at the end of your compiler command line to
resolve this reference.)

 The program 'collect2' is installed as 'ld' in the directory where the
passes of the compiler are installed.  When 'collect2' needs to find the
_real_ 'ld', it tries the following file names:

   * a hard coded linker file name, if GCC was configured with the
     '--with-ld' option.

   * 'real-ld' in the directories listed in the compiler's search
     directories.

   * 'real-ld' in the directories listed in the environment variable
     'PATH'.

   * The file specified in the 'REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
     if specified.

   * 'ld' in the compiler's search directories, except that 'collect2'
     will not execute itself recursively.

   * 'ld' in 'PATH'.

 "The compiler's search directories" means all the directories where
'gcc' searches for passes of the compiler.  This includes directories
that you specify with '-B'.

 Cross-compilers search a little differently:

   * 'real-ld' in the compiler's search directories.

   * 'TARGET-real-ld' in 'PATH'.

   * The file specified in the 'REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
     if specified.

   * 'ld' in the compiler's search directories.

   * 'TARGET-ld' in 'PATH'.

 'collect2' explicitly avoids running 'ld' using the file name under
which 'collect2' itself was invoked.  In fact, it remembers up a list of
such names--in case one copy of 'collect2' finds another copy (or
version) of 'collect2' installed as 'ld' in a second place in the search
path.

 'collect2' searches for the utilities 'nm' and 'strip' using the same
algorithm as above for 'ld'.

21 Standard Header File Directories
***********************************

'GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.  It is
where GCC stores its private include files, and also where GCC stores
the fixed include files.  A cross compiled GCC runs 'fixincludes' on the
header files in '$(tooldir)/include'.  (If the cross compilation header
files need to be fixed, they must be installed before GCC is built.  If
the cross compilation header files are already suitable for GCC, nothing
special need be done).

 'GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.  It
is where 'g++' looks first for header files.  The C++ library installs
only target independent header files in that directory.

 'LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only by native compilers.  GCC doesn't
install anything there.  It is normally '/usr/local/include'.  This is
where local additions to a packaged system should place header files.

 'CROSS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only by cross compilers.  GCC doesn't
install anything there.

 'TOOL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used for both native and cross compilers.  It is
the place for other packages to install header files that GCC will use.
For a cross-compiler, this is the equivalent of '/usr/include'.  When
you build a cross-compiler, 'fixincludes' processes any header files in
this directory.

22 Memory Management and Type Information
*****************************************

GCC uses some fairly sophisticated memory management techniques, which
involve determining information about GCC's data structures from GCC's
source code and using this information to perform garbage collection and
implement precompiled headers.

 A full C++ parser would be too complicated for this task, so a limited
subset of C++ is interpreted and special markers are used to determine
what parts of the source to look at.  All 'struct', 'union' and
'template' structure declarations that define data structures that are
allocated under control of the garbage collector must be marked.  All
global variables that hold pointers to garbage-collected memory must
also be marked.  Finally, all global variables that need to be saved and
restored by a precompiled header must be marked.  (The precompiled
header mechanism can only save static variables if they're scalar.
Complex data structures must be allocated in garbage-collected memory to
be saved in a precompiled header.)

 The full format of a marker is
     GTY (([OPTION] [(PARAM)], [OPTION] [(PARAM)] ...))
but in most cases no options are needed.  The outer double parentheses
are still necessary, though: 'GTY(())'.  Markers can appear:

   * In a structure definition, before the open brace;
   * In a global variable declaration, after the keyword 'static' or
     'extern'; and
   * In a structure field definition, before the name of the field.

 Here are some examples of marking simple data structures and globals.

     struct GTY(()) TAG
     {
       FIELDS...
     };

     typedef struct GTY(()) TAG
     {

     } *TYPENAME;

     static GTY(()) struct TAG *LIST;   /* points to GC memory */
     static GTY(()) int COUNTER;        /* save counter in a PCH */

 The parser understands simple typedefs such as 'typedef struct TAG
*NAME;' and 'typedef int NAME;'.  These don't need to be marked.

 Since 'gengtype''s understanding of C++ is limited, there are several
constructs and declarations that are not supported inside
classes/structures marked for automatic GC code generation.  The
following C++ constructs produce a 'gengtype' error on
structures/classes marked for automatic GC code generation:

   * Type definitions inside classes/structures are not supported.
   * Enumerations inside classes/structures are not supported.

 If you have a class or structure using any of the above constructs, you
need to mark that class as 'GTY ((user))' and provide your own marking
routines (see section *note User GC:: for details).

 It is always valid to include function definitions inside classes.
Those are always ignored by 'gengtype', as it only cares about data
members.

22.1 The Inside of a 'GTY(())'
==============================

Sometimes the C code is not enough to fully describe the type structure.
Extra information can be provided with 'GTY' options and additional
markers.  Some options take a parameter, which may be either a string or
a type name, depending on the parameter.  If an option takes no
parameter, it is acceptable either to omit the parameter entirely, or to
provide an empty string as a parameter.  For example, 'GTY ((skip))' and
'GTY ((skip ("")))' are equivalent.

 When the parameter is a string, often it is a fragment of C code.  Four
special escapes may be used in these strings, to refer to pieces of the
data structure being marked:

'%h'
     The current structure.
'%1'
     The structure that immediately contains the current structure.
'%0'
     The outermost structure that contains the current structure.
'%a'
     A partial expression of the form '[i1][i2]...' that indexes the
     array item currently being marked.

 For instance, suppose that you have a structure of the form
     struct A {
       ...
     };
     struct B {
       struct A foo[12];
     };
and 'b' is a variable of type 'struct B'.  When marking 'b.foo[11]',
'%h' would expand to 'b.foo[11]', '%0' and '%1' would both expand to
'b', and '%a' would expand to '[11]'.

 As in ordinary C, adjacent strings will be concatenated; this is
helpful when you have a complicated expression.
     GTY ((chain_next ("TREE_CODE (&%h.generic) == INTEGER_TYPE"
                       " ? TYPE_NEXT_VARIANT (&%h.generic)"
                       " : TREE_CHAIN (&%h.generic)")))

 The available options are:

'length ("EXPRESSION")'

     There are two places the type machinery will need to be explicitly
     told the length of an array of non-atomic objects.  The first case
     is when a structure ends in a variable-length array, like this:
          struct GTY(()) rtvec_def {
            int num_elem;         /* number of elements */
            rtx GTY ((length ("%h.num_elem"))) elem[1];
          };

     In this case, the 'length' option is used to override the specified
     array length (which should usually be '1').  The parameter of the
     option is a fragment of C code that calculates the length.

     The second case is when a structure or a global variable contains a
     pointer to an array, like this:
          struct gimple_omp_for_iter * GTY((length ("%h.collapse"))) iter;
     In this case, 'iter' has been allocated by writing something like
            x->iter = ggc_alloc_cleared_vec_gimple_omp_for_iter (collapse);
     and the 'collapse' provides the length of the field.

     This second use of 'length' also works on global variables, like:
     static GTY((length("reg_known_value_size"))) rtx *reg_known_value;

     Note that the 'length' option is only meant for use with arrays of
     non-atomic objects, that is, objects that contain pointers pointing
     to other GTY-managed objects.  For other GC-allocated arrays and
     strings you should use 'atomic'.

'skip'

     If 'skip' is applied to a field, the type machinery will ignore it.
     This is somewhat dangerous; the only safe use is in a union when
     one field really isn't ever used.

'desc ("EXPRESSION")'
'tag ("CONSTANT")'
'default'

     The type machinery needs to be told which field of a 'union' is
     currently active.  This is done by giving each field a constant
     'tag' value, and then specifying a discriminator using 'desc'.  The
     value of the expression given by 'desc' is compared against each
     'tag' value, each of which should be different.  If no 'tag' is
     matched, the field marked with 'default' is used if there is one,
     otherwise no field in the union will be marked.

     In the 'desc' option, the "current structure" is the union that it
     discriminates.  Use '%1' to mean the structure containing it.
     There are no escapes available to the 'tag' option, since it is a
     constant.

     For example,
          struct GTY(()) tree_binding
          {
            struct tree_common common;
            union tree_binding_u {
              tree GTY ((tag ("0"))) scope;
              struct cp_binding_level * GTY ((tag ("1"))) level;
            } GTY ((desc ("BINDING_HAS_LEVEL_P ((tree)&%0)"))) xscope;
            tree value;
          };

     In this example, the value of BINDING_HAS_LEVEL_P when applied to a
     'struct tree_binding *' is presumed to be 0 or 1.  If 1, the type
     mechanism will treat the field 'level' as being present and if 0,
     will treat the field 'scope' as being present.

     The 'desc' and 'tag' options can also be used for inheritance to
     denote which subclass an instance is.  See *note Inheritance and
     GTY:: for more information.

'param_is (TYPE)'
'use_param'

     Sometimes it's convenient to define some data structure to work on
     generic pointers (that is, 'PTR') and then use it with a specific
     type.  'param_is' specifies the real type pointed to, and
     'use_param' says where in the generic data structure that type
     should be put.

     For instance, to have a 'htab_t' that points to trees, one would
     write the definition of 'htab_t' like this:
          typedef struct GTY(()) {
            ...
            void ** GTY ((use_param, ...)) entries;
            ...
          } htab_t;
     and then declare variables like this:
            static htab_t GTY ((param_is (union tree_node))) ict;

'paramN_is (TYPE)'
'use_paramN'

     In more complicated cases, the data structure might need to work on
     several different types, which might not necessarily all be
     pointers.  For this, 'param1_is' through 'param9_is' may be used to
     specify the real type of a field identified by 'use_param1' through
     'use_param9'.

'use_params'

     When a structure contains another structure that is parameterized,
     there's no need to do anything special, the inner structure
     inherits the parameters of the outer one.  When a structure
     contains a pointer to a parameterized structure, the type machinery
     won't automatically detect this (it could, it just doesn't yet), so
     it's necessary to tell it that the pointed-to structure should use
     the same parameters as the outer structure.  This is done by
     marking the pointer with the 'use_params' option.

'deletable'

     'deletable', when applied to a global variable, indicates that when
     garbage collection runs, there's no need to mark anything pointed
     to by this variable, it can just be set to 'NULL' instead.  This is
     used to keep a list of free structures around for re-use.

'if_marked ("EXPRESSION")'

     Suppose you want some kinds of object to be unique, and so you put
     them in a hash table.  If garbage collection marks the hash table,
     these objects will never be freed, even if the last other reference
     to them goes away.  GGC has special handling to deal with this: if
     you use the 'if_marked' option on a global hash table, GGC will
     call the routine whose name is the parameter to the option on each
     hash table entry.  If the routine returns nonzero, the hash table
     entry will be marked as usual.  If the routine returns zero, the
     hash table entry will be deleted.

     The routine 'ggc_marked_p' can be used to determine if an element
     has been marked already; in fact, the usual case is to use
     'if_marked ("ggc_marked_p")'.

'mark_hook ("HOOK-ROUTINE-NAME")'

     If provided for a structure or union type, the given
     HOOK-ROUTINE-NAME (between double-quotes) is the name of a routine
     called when the garbage collector has just marked the data as
     reachable.  This routine should not change the data, or call any
     ggc routine.  Its only argument is a pointer to the just marked
     (const) structure or union.

'maybe_undef'

     When applied to a field, 'maybe_undef' indicates that it's OK if
     the structure that this fields points to is never defined, so long
     as this field is always 'NULL'.  This is used to avoid requiring
     backends to define certain optional structures.  It doesn't work
     with language frontends.

'nested_ptr (TYPE, "TO EXPRESSION", "FROM EXPRESSION")'

     The type machinery expects all pointers to point to the start of an
     object.  Sometimes for abstraction purposes it's convenient to have
     a pointer which points inside an object.  So long as it's possible
     to convert the original object to and from the pointer, such
     pointers can still be used.  TYPE is the type of the original
     object, the TO EXPRESSION returns the pointer given the original
     object, and the FROM EXPRESSION returns the original object given
     the pointer.  The pointer will be available using the '%h' escape.

'chain_next ("EXPRESSION")'
'chain_prev ("EXPRESSION")'
'chain_circular ("EXPRESSION")'

     It's helpful for the type machinery to know if objects are often
     chained together in long lists; this lets it generate code that
     uses less stack space by iterating along the list instead of
     recursing down it.  'chain_next' is an expression for the next item
     in the list, 'chain_prev' is an expression for the previous item.
     For singly linked lists, use only 'chain_next'; for doubly linked
     lists, use both.  The machinery requires that taking the next item
     of the previous item gives the original item.  'chain_circular' is
     similar to 'chain_next', but can be used for circular single linked
     lists.

'reorder ("FUNCTION NAME")'

     Some data structures depend on the relative ordering of pointers.
     If the precompiled header machinery needs to change that ordering,
     it will call the function referenced by the 'reorder' option,
     before changing the pointers in the object that's pointed to by the
     field the option applies to.  The function must take four
     arguments, with the signature
     'void *, void *, gt_pointer_operator, void *'.  The first parameter
     is a pointer to the structure that contains the object being
     updated, or the object itself if there is no containing structure.
     The second parameter is a cookie that should be ignored.  The third
     parameter is a routine that, given a pointer, will update it to its
     correct new value.  The fourth parameter is a cookie that must be
     passed to the second parameter.

     PCH cannot handle data structures that depend on the absolute
     values of pointers.  'reorder' functions can be expensive.  When
     possible, it is better to depend on properties of the data, like an
     ID number or the hash of a string instead.

'variable_size'

     The type machinery expects the types to be of constant size.  When
     this is not true, for example, with structs that have array fields
     or unions, the type machinery cannot tell how many bytes need to be
     allocated at each allocation.  The 'variable_size' is used to mark
     such types.  The type machinery then provides allocators that take
     a parameter indicating an exact size of object being allocated.
     Note that the size must be provided in bytes whereas the 'length'
     option works with array lengths in number of elements.

     For example,
          struct GTY((variable_size)) sorted_fields_type {
            int len;
            tree GTY((length ("%h.len"))) elts[1];
          };

     Then the objects of 'struct sorted_fields_type' are allocated in GC
     memory as follows:
            field_vec = ggc_alloc_sorted_fields_type (size);

     If FIELD_VEC->ELTS stores N elements, then SIZE could be calculated
     as follows:
            size_t size = sizeof (struct sorted_fields_type) + n * sizeof (tree);

'atomic'

     The 'atomic' option can only be used with pointers.  It informs the
     GC machinery that the memory that the pointer points to does not
     contain any pointers, and hence it should be treated by the GC and
     PCH machinery as an "atomic" block of memory that does not need to
     be examined when scanning memory for pointers.  In particular, the
     machinery will not scan that memory for pointers to mark them as
     reachable (when marking pointers for GC) or to relocate them (when
     writing a PCH file).

     The 'atomic' option differs from the 'skip' option.  'atomic' keeps
     the memory under Garbage Collection, but makes the GC ignore the
     contents of the memory.  'skip' is more drastic in that it causes
     the pointer and the memory to be completely ignored by the Garbage
     Collector.  So, memory marked as 'atomic' is automatically freed
     when no longer reachable, while memory marked as 'skip' is not.

     The 'atomic' option must be used with great care, because all sorts
     of problem can occur if used incorrectly, that is, if the memory
     the pointer points to does actually contain a pointer.

     Here is an example of how to use it:
          struct GTY(()) my_struct {
            int number_of_elements;
            unsigned int * GTY ((atomic)) elements;
          };
     In this case, 'elements' is a pointer under GC, and the memory it
     points to needs to be allocated using the Garbage Collector, and
     will be freed automatically by the Garbage Collector when it is no
     longer referenced.  But the memory that the pointer points to is an
     array of 'unsigned int' elements, and the GC must not try to scan
     it to find pointers to mark or relocate, which is why it is marked
     with the 'atomic' option.

     Note that, currently, global variables can not be marked with
     'atomic'; only fields of a struct can.  This is a known limitation.
     It would be useful to be able to mark global pointers with 'atomic'
     to make the PCH machinery aware of them so that they are saved and
     restored correctly to PCH files.

'special ("NAME")'

     The 'special' option is used to mark types that have to be dealt
     with by special case machinery.  The parameter is the name of the
     special case.  See 'gengtype.c' for further details.  Avoid adding
     new special cases unless there is no other alternative.

'user'

     The 'user' option indicates that the code to mark structure fields
     is completely handled by user-provided routines.  See section *note
     User GC:: for details on what functions need to be provided.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Inheritance and GTY,  Next: User GC,  Prev: GTY Options,  Up: Type Information

22.2 Support for inheritance
============================

gengtype has some support for simple class hierarchies.  You can use
this to have gengtype autogenerate marking routines, provided:

   * There must be a concrete base class, with a discriminator
     expression that can be used to identify which subclass an instance
     is.
   * Only single inheritance is used.
   * None of the classes within the hierarchy are templates.

 If your class hierarchy does not fit in this pattern, you must use
*note User GC:: instead.

 The base class and its discriminator must be identified using the
"desc" option.  Each concrete subclass must use the "tag" option to
identify which value of the discriminator it corresponds to.

 Every class in the hierarchy must have a 'GTY(())' marker, as gengtype
will only attempt to parse classes that have such a marker (1).

     class GTY((desc("%h.kind"), tag("0"))) example_base
     {
     public:
         int kind;
         tree a;
     };

     class GTY((tag("1")) some_subclass : public example_base
     {
     public:
         tree b;
     };

     class GTY((tag("2")) some_other_subclass : public example_base
     {
     public:
         tree c;
     };

 The generated marking routines for the above will contain a "switch" on
"kind", visiting all appropriate fields.  For example, if kind is 2, it
will cast to "some_other_subclass" and visit fields a, b, and c.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Classes lacking such a marker will not be identified as being
part of the hierarchy, and so the marking routines will not handle them,
leading to a assertion failure within the marking routines due to an
unknown tag value (assuming that assertions are enabled).


File: gccint.info,  Node: User GC,  Next: GGC Roots,  Prev: Inheritance and GTY,  Up: Type Information

22.3 Support for user-provided GC marking routines
==================================================

The garbage collector supports types for which no automatic marking code
is generated.  For these types, the user is required to provide three
functions: one to act as a marker for garbage collection, and two
functions to act as marker and pointer walker for pre-compiled headers.

 Given a structure 'struct GTY((user)) my_struct', the following
functions should be defined to mark 'my_struct':

     void gt_ggc_mx (my_struct *p)
     {
       /* This marks field 'fld'.  */
       gt_ggc_mx (p->fld);
     }

     void gt_pch_nx (my_struct *p)
     {
       /* This marks field 'fld'.  */
       gt_pch_nx (tp->fld);
     }

     void gt_pch_nx (my_struct *p, gt_pointer_operator op, void *cookie)
     {
       /* For every field 'fld', call the given pointer operator.  */
       op (&(tp->fld), cookie);
     }

 In general, each marker 'M' should call 'M' for every pointer field in
the structure.  Fields that are not allocated in GC or are not pointers
must be ignored.

 For embedded lists (e.g., structures with a 'next' or 'prev' pointer),
the marker must follow the chain and mark every element in it.

 Note that the rules for the pointer walker 'gt_pch_nx (my_struct *,
gt_pointer_operator, void *)' are slightly different.  In this case, the
operation 'op' must be applied to the _address_ of every pointer field.

22.3.1 User-provided marking routines for template types
--------------------------------------------------------

When a template type 'TP' is marked with 'GTY', all instances of that
type are considered user-provided types.  This means that the individual
instances of 'TP' do not need to be marked with 'GTY'.  The user needs
to provide template functions to mark all the fields of the type.

 The following code snippets represent all the functions that need to be
provided.  Note that type 'TP' may reference to more than one type.  In
these snippets, there is only one type 'T', but there could be more.

     template<typename T>
     void gt_ggc_mx (TP<T> *tp)
     {
       extern void gt_ggc_mx (T&);

       /* This marks field 'fld' of type 'T'.  */
       gt_ggc_mx (tp->fld);
     }

     template<typename T>
     void gt_pch_nx (TP<T> *tp)
     {
       extern void gt_pch_nx (T&);

       /* This marks field 'fld' of type 'T'.  */
       gt_pch_nx (tp->fld);
     }

     template<typename T>
     void gt_pch_nx (TP<T *> *tp, gt_pointer_operator op, void *cookie)
     {
       /* For every field 'fld' of 'tp' with type 'T *', call the given
          pointer operator.  */
       op (&(tp->fld), cookie);
     }

     template<typename T>
     void gt_pch_nx (TP<T> *tp, gt_pointer_operator, void *cookie)
     {
       extern void gt_pch_nx (T *, gt_pointer_operator, void *);

       /* For every field 'fld' of 'tp' with type 'T', call the pointer
          walker for all the fields of T.  */
       gt_pch_nx (&(tp->fld), op, cookie);
     }

 Support for user-defined types is currently limited.  The following
restrictions apply:

  1. Type 'TP' and all the argument types 'T' must be marked with 'GTY'.

  2. Type 'TP' can only have type names in its argument list.

  3. The pointer walker functions are different for 'TP<T>' and 'TP<T
     *>'.  In the case of 'TP<T>', references to 'T' must be handled by
     calling 'gt_pch_nx' (which will, in turn, walk all the pointers
     inside fields of 'T').  In the case of 'TP<T *>', references to 'T
     *' must be handled by calling the 'op' function on the address of
     the pointer (see the code snippets above).

22.4 Marking Roots for the Garbage Collector
============================================

In addition to keeping track of types, the type machinery also locates
the global variables ("roots") that the garbage collector starts at.
Roots must be declared using one of the following syntaxes:

   * 'extern GTY(([OPTIONS])) TYPE NAME;'
   * 'static GTY(([OPTIONS])) TYPE NAME;'
The syntax
   * 'GTY(([OPTIONS])) TYPE NAME;'
is _not_ accepted.  There should be an 'extern' declaration of such a
variable in a header somewhere--mark that, not the definition.  Or, if
the variable is only used in one file, make it 'static'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Files,  Next: Invoking the garbage collector,  Prev: GGC Roots,  Up: Type Information

22.5 Source Files Containing Type Information
=============================================

Whenever you add 'GTY' markers to a source file that previously had
none, or create a new source file containing 'GTY' markers, there are
three things you need to do:

  1. You need to add the file to the list of source files the type
     machinery scans.  There are four cases:

       a. For a back-end file, this is usually done automatically; if
          not, you should add it to 'target_gtfiles' in the appropriate
          port's entries in 'config.gcc'.

       b. For files shared by all front ends, add the filename to the
          'GTFILES' variable in 'Makefile.in'.

       c. For files that are part of one front end, add the filename to
          the 'gtfiles' variable defined in the appropriate
          'config-lang.in'.  Headers should appear before non-headers in
          this list.

       d. For files that are part of some but not all front ends, add
          the filename to the 'gtfiles' variable of _all_ the front ends
          that use it.

  2. If the file was a header file, you'll need to check that it's
     included in the right place to be visible to the generated files.
     For a back-end header file, this should be done automatically.  For
     a front-end header file, it needs to be included by the same file
     that includes 'gtype-LANG.h'.  For other header files, it needs to
     be included in 'gtype-desc.c', which is a generated file, so add it
     to 'ifiles' in 'open_base_file' in 'gengtype.c'.

     For source files that aren't header files, the machinery will
     generate a header file that should be included in the source file
     you just changed.  The file will be called 'gt-PATH.h' where PATH
     is the pathname relative to the 'gcc' directory with slashes
     replaced by -, so for example the header file to be included in
     'cp/parser.c' is called 'gt-cp-parser.c'.  The generated header
     file should be included after everything else in the source file.
     Don't forget to mention this file as a dependency in the
     'Makefile'!

 For language frontends, there is another file that needs to be included
somewhere.  It will be called 'gtype-LANG.h', where LANG is the name of
the subdirectory the language is contained in.

 Plugins can add additional root tables.  Run the 'gengtype' utility in
plugin mode as 'gengtype -P pluginout.h SOURCE-DIR FILE-LIST PLUGIN*.C'
with your plugin files PLUGIN*.C using 'GTY' to generate the PLUGINOUT.H
file.  The GCC build tree is needed to be present in that mode.

22.6 How to invoke the garbage collector
========================================

The GCC garbage collector GGC is only invoked explicitly.  In contrast
with many other garbage collectors, it is not implicitly invoked by
allocation routines when a lot of memory has been consumed.  So the only
way to have GGC reclaim storage is to call the 'ggc_collect' function
explicitly.  This call is an expensive operation, as it may have to scan
the entire heap.  Beware that local variables (on the GCC call stack)
are not followed by such an invocation (as many other garbage collectors
do): you should reference all your data from static or external 'GTY'-ed
variables, and it is advised to call 'ggc_collect' with a shallow call
stack.  The GGC is an exact mark and sweep garbage collector (so it does
not scan the call stack for pointers).  In practice GCC passes don't
often call 'ggc_collect' themselves, because it is called by the pass
manager between passes.

 At the time of the 'ggc_collect' call all pointers in the GC-marked
structures must be valid or 'NULL'.  In practice this means that there
should not be uninitialized pointer fields in the structures even if
your code never reads or writes those fields at a particular instance.
One way to ensure this is to use cleared versions of allocators unless
all the fields are initialized manually immediately after allocation.

22.7 Troubleshooting the garbage collector
==========================================

With the current garbage collector implementation, most issues should
show up as GCC compilation errors.  Some of the most commonly
encountered issues are described below.

   * Gengtype does not produce allocators for a 'GTY'-marked type.
     Gengtype checks if there is at least one possible path from GC
     roots to at least one instance of each type before outputting
     allocators.  If there is no such path, the 'GTY' markers will be
     ignored and no allocators will be output.  Solve this by making
     sure that there exists at least one such path.  If creating it is
     unfeasible or raises a "code smell", consider if you really must
     use GC for allocating such type.

   * Link-time errors about undefined 'gt_ggc_r_foo_bar' and
     similarly-named symbols.  Check if your 'foo_bar' source file has
     '#include "gt-foo_bar.h"' as its very last line.

23 Plugins
**********

GCC plugin is a loadable module that provides extra features to the
compiler, which they can further pass around as a shareable module.

 GCC plugins provide developers with a rich subset of the GCC API to
allow them to extend GCC as they see fit.  Whether it is writing an
additional optimization pass, transforming code, or analyzing
information, plugins can be quite useful.

23.1 Loading Plugins
====================

Plugins are supported on platforms that support '-ldl -rdynamic'.  They
are loaded by the compiler using 'dlopen' and invoked at pre-determined
locations in the compilation process.

 Plugins are loaded with

 '-fplugin=/path/to/NAME.so' '-fplugin-arg-NAME-KEY1[=VALUE1]'

 The plugin arguments are parsed by GCC and passed to respective plugins
as key-value pairs.  Multiple plugins can be invoked by specifying
multiple '-fplugin' arguments.

 A plugin can be simply given by its short name (no dots or slashes).
When simply passing '-fplugin=NAME', the plugin is loaded from the
'plugin' directory, so '-fplugin=NAME' is the same as '-fplugin=`gcc
-print-file-name=plugin`/NAME.so', using backquote shell syntax to query
the 'plugin' directory.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugin API,  Next: Plugins pass,  Prev: Plugins loading,  Up: Plugins

23.2 Plugin API
===============

Plugins are activated by the compiler at specific events as defined in
'gcc-plugin.h'.  For each event of interest, the plugin should call
'register_callback' specifying the name of the event and address of the
callback function that will handle that event.

 The header 'gcc-plugin.h' must be the first gcc header to be included.

23.2.1 Plugin license check
---------------------------

Every plugin should define the global symbol 'plugin_is_GPL_compatible'
to assert that it has been licensed under a GPL-compatible license.  If
this symbol does not exist, the compiler will emit a fatal error and
exit with the error message:

     fatal error: plugin NAME is not licensed under a GPL-compatible license
     NAME: undefined symbol: plugin_is_GPL_compatible
     compilation terminated

 The declared type of the symbol should be int, to match a forward
declaration in 'gcc-plugin.h' that suppresses C++ mangling.  It does not
need to be in any allocated section, though.  The compiler merely
asserts that the symbol exists in the global scope.  Something like this
is enough:

     int plugin_is_GPL_compatible;

23.2.2 Plugin initialization
----------------------------

Every plugin should export a function called 'plugin_init' that is
called right after the plugin is loaded.  This function is responsible
for registering all the callbacks required by the plugin and do any
other required initialization.

 This function is called from 'compile_file' right before invoking the
parser.  The arguments to 'plugin_init' are:

   * 'plugin_info': Plugin invocation information.
   * 'version': GCC version.

 The 'plugin_info' struct is defined as follows:

     struct plugin_name_args
     {
       char *base_name;              /* Short name of the plugin
                                        (filename without .so suffix). */
       const char *full_name;        /* Path to the plugin as specified with
                                        -fplugin=. */
       int argc;                     /* Number of arguments specified with
                                        -fplugin-arg-.... */
       struct plugin_argument *argv; /* Array of ARGC key-value pairs. */
       const char *version;          /* Version string provided by plugin. */
       const char *help;             /* Help string provided by plugin. */
     }

 If initialization fails, 'plugin_init' must return a non-zero value.
Otherwise, it should return 0.

 The version of the GCC compiler loading the plugin is described by the
following structure:

     struct plugin_gcc_version
     {
       const char *basever;
       const char *datestamp;
       const char *devphase;
       const char *revision;
       const char *configuration_arguments;
     };

 The function 'plugin_default_version_check' takes two pointers to such
structure and compare them field by field.  It can be used by the
plugin's 'plugin_init' function.

 The version of GCC used to compile the plugin can be found in the
symbol 'gcc_version' defined in the header 'plugin-version.h'.  The
recommended version check to perform looks like

     #include "plugin-version.h"
     ...

     int
     plugin_init (struct plugin_name_args *plugin_info,
                  struct plugin_gcc_version *version)
     {
       if (!plugin_default_version_check (version, &gcc_version))
         return 1;

     }

 but you can also check the individual fields if you want a less strict
check.

23.2.3 Plugin callbacks
-----------------------

Callback functions have the following prototype:

     /* The prototype for a plugin callback function.
          gcc_data  - event-specific data provided by GCC
          user_data - plugin-specific data provided by the plug-in.  */
     typedef void (*plugin_callback_func)(void *gcc_data, void *user_data);

 Callbacks can be invoked at the following pre-determined events:

     enum plugin_event
     {
       PLUGIN_PASS_MANAGER_SETUP,    /* To hook into pass manager.  */
       PLUGIN_FINISH_TYPE,           /* After finishing parsing a type.  */
       PLUGIN_FINISH_DECL,           /* After finishing parsing a declaration. */
       PLUGIN_FINISH_UNIT,           /* Useful for summary processing.  */
       PLUGIN_PRE_GENERICIZE,        /* Allows to see low level AST in C and C++ frontends.  */
       PLUGIN_FINISH,                /* Called before GCC exits.  */
       PLUGIN_INFO,                  /* Information about the plugin. */
       PLUGIN_GGC_START,             /* Called at start of GCC Garbage Collection. */
       PLUGIN_GGC_MARKING,           /* Extend the GGC marking. */
       PLUGIN_GGC_END,               /* Called at end of GGC. */
       PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_ROOTS,    /* Register an extra GGC root table. */
       PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_CACHES,   /* Register an extra GGC cache table. */
       PLUGIN_ATTRIBUTES,            /* Called during attribute registration */
       PLUGIN_START_UNIT,            /* Called before processing a translation unit.  */
       PLUGIN_PRAGMAS,               /* Called during pragma registration. */
       /* Called before first pass from all_passes.  */
       PLUGIN_ALL_PASSES_START,
       /* Called after last pass from all_passes.  */
       PLUGIN_ALL_PASSES_END,
       /* Called before first ipa pass.  */
       PLUGIN_ALL_IPA_PASSES_START,
       /* Called after last ipa pass.  */
       PLUGIN_ALL_IPA_PASSES_END,
       /* Allows to override pass gate decision for current_pass.  */
       PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE,
       /* Called before executing a pass.  */
       PLUGIN_PASS_EXECUTION,
       /* Called before executing subpasses of a GIMPLE_PASS in
          execute_ipa_pass_list.  */
       PLUGIN_EARLY_GIMPLE_PASSES_START,
       /* Called after executing subpasses of a GIMPLE_PASS in
          execute_ipa_pass_list.  */
       PLUGIN_EARLY_GIMPLE_PASSES_END,
       /* Called when a pass is first instantiated.  */
       PLUGIN_NEW_PASS,
     /* Called when a file is #include-d or given via the #line directive.
        This could happen many times.  The event data is the included file path,
        as a const char* pointer.  */
       PLUGIN_INCLUDE_FILE,

       PLUGIN_EVENT_FIRST_DYNAMIC    /* Dummy event used for indexing callback
                                        array.  */
     };

 In addition, plugins can also look up the enumerator of a named event,
and / or generate new events dynamically, by calling the function
'get_named_event_id'.

 To register a callback, the plugin calls 'register_callback' with the
arguments:

   * 'char *name': Plugin name.
   * 'int event': The event code.
   * 'plugin_callback_func callback': The function that handles 'event'.
   * 'void *user_data': Pointer to plugin-specific data.

 For the PLUGIN_PASS_MANAGER_SETUP, PLUGIN_INFO,
PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_ROOTS and PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_CACHES pseudo-events
the 'callback' should be null, and the 'user_data' is specific.

 When the PLUGIN_PRAGMAS event is triggered (with a null pointer as data
from GCC), plugins may register their own pragmas.  Notice that pragmas
are not available from 'lto1', so plugins used with '-flto' option to
GCC during link-time optimization cannot use pragmas and do not even see
functions like 'c_register_pragma' or 'pragma_lex'.

 The PLUGIN_INCLUDE_FILE event, with a 'const char*' file path as GCC
data, is triggered for processing of '#include' or '#line' directives.

 The PLUGIN_FINISH event is the last time that plugins can call GCC
functions, notably emit diagnostics with 'warning', 'error' etc.

23.3 Interacting with the pass manager
======================================

There needs to be a way to add/reorder/remove passes dynamically.  This
is useful for both analysis plugins (plugging in after a certain pass
such as CFG or an IPA pass) and optimization plugins.

 Basic support for inserting new passes or replacing existing passes is
provided.  A plugin registers a new pass with GCC by calling
'register_callback' with the 'PLUGIN_PASS_MANAGER_SETUP' event and a
pointer to a 'struct register_pass_info' object defined as follows

     enum pass_positioning_ops
     {
       PASS_POS_INSERT_AFTER,  // Insert after the reference pass.
       PASS_POS_INSERT_BEFORE, // Insert before the reference pass.
       PASS_POS_REPLACE        // Replace the reference pass.
     };

     struct register_pass_info
     {
       struct opt_pass *pass;            /* New pass provided by the plugin.  */
       const char *reference_pass_name;  /* Name of the reference pass for hooking
                                            up the new pass.  */
       int ref_pass_instance_number;     /* Insert the pass at the specified
                                            instance number of the reference pass.  */
                                         /* Do it for every instance if it is 0.  */
       enum pass_positioning_ops pos_op; /* how to insert the new pass.  */
     };


     /* Sample plugin code that registers a new pass.  */
     int
     plugin_init (struct plugin_name_args *plugin_info,
                  struct plugin_gcc_version *version)
     {
       struct register_pass_info pass_info;

       ...

       /* Code to fill in the pass_info object with new pass information.  */

       ...

       /* Register the new pass.  */
       register_callback (plugin_info->base_name, PLUGIN_PASS_MANAGER_SETUP, NULL, &pass_info);

       ...
     }


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins GC,  Next: Plugins description,  Prev: Plugins pass,  Up: Plugins

23.4 Interacting with the GCC Garbage Collector
===============================================

Some plugins may want to be informed when GGC (the GCC Garbage
Collector) is running.  They can register callbacks for the
'PLUGIN_GGC_START' and 'PLUGIN_GGC_END' events (for which the callback
is called with a null 'gcc_data') to be notified of the start or end of
the GCC garbage collection.

 Some plugins may need to have GGC mark additional data.  This can be
done by registering a callback (called with a null 'gcc_data') for the
'PLUGIN_GGC_MARKING' event.  Such callbacks can call the 'ggc_set_mark'
routine, preferably through the 'ggc_mark' macro (and conversely, these
routines should usually not be used in plugins outside of the
'PLUGIN_GGC_MARKING' event).

 Some plugins may need to add extra GGC root tables, e.g.  to handle
their own 'GTY'-ed data.  This can be done with the
'PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_ROOTS' pseudo-event with a null callback and the
extra root table (of type 'struct ggc_root_tab*') as 'user_data'.
Plugins that want to use the 'if_marked' hash table option can add the
extra GGC cache tables generated by 'gengtype' using the
'PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_CACHES' pseudo-event with a null callback and the
extra cache table (of type 'struct ggc_cache_tab*') as 'user_data'.
Running the 'gengtype -p SOURCE-DIR FILE-LIST PLUGIN*.C ...' utility
generates these extra root tables.

 You should understand the details of memory management inside GCC
before using 'PLUGIN_GGC_MARKING', 'PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_ROOTS' or
'PLUGIN_REGISTER_GGC_CACHES'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins description,  Next: Plugins attr,  Prev: Plugins GC,  Up: Plugins

23.5 Giving information about a plugin
======================================

A plugin should give some information to the user about itself.  This
uses the following structure:

     struct plugin_info
     {
       const char *version;
       const char *help;
     };

 Such a structure is passed as the 'user_data' by the plugin's init
routine using 'register_callback' with the 'PLUGIN_INFO' pseudo-event
and a null callback.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins attr,  Next: Plugins recording,  Prev: Plugins description,  Up: Plugins

23.6 Registering custom attributes or pragmas
=============================================

For analysis (or other) purposes it is useful to be able to add custom
attributes or pragmas.

 The 'PLUGIN_ATTRIBUTES' callback is called during attribute
registration.  Use the 'register_attribute' function to register custom
attributes.

     /* Attribute handler callback */
     static tree
     handle_user_attribute (tree *node, tree name, tree args,
                            int flags, bool *no_add_attrs)
     {
       return NULL_TREE;
     }

     /* Attribute definition */
     static struct attribute_spec user_attr =
       { "user", 1, 1, false,  false, false, handle_user_attribute, false };

     /* Plugin callback called during attribute registration.
     Registered with register_callback (plugin_name, PLUGIN_ATTRIBUTES, register_attributes, NULL)
     */
     static void
     register_attributes (void *event_data, void *data)
     {
       warning (0, G_("Callback to register attributes"));
       register_attribute (&user_attr);
     }


 The PLUGIN_PRAGMAS callback is called once during pragmas registration.
Use the 'c_register_pragma', 'c_register_pragma_with_data',
'c_register_pragma_with_expansion',
'c_register_pragma_with_expansion_and_data' functions to register custom
pragmas and their handlers (which often want to call 'pragma_lex') from
'c-family/c-pragma.h'.

     /* Plugin callback called during pragmas registration. Registered with
          register_callback (plugin_name, PLUGIN_PRAGMAS,
                             register_my_pragma, NULL);
     */
     static void
     register_my_pragma (void *event_data, void *data)
     {
       warning (0, G_("Callback to register pragmas"));
       c_register_pragma ("GCCPLUGIN", "sayhello", handle_pragma_sayhello);
     }

 It is suggested to pass '"GCCPLUGIN"' (or a short name identifying your
plugin) as the "space" argument of your pragma.

 Pragmas registered with 'c_register_pragma_with_expansion' or
'c_register_pragma_with_expansion_and_data' support preprocessor
expansions.  For example:

     #define NUMBER 10
     #pragma GCCPLUGIN foothreshold (NUMBER)


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins recording,  Next: Plugins gate,  Prev: Plugins attr,  Up: Plugins

23.7 Recording information about pass execution
===============================================

The event PLUGIN_PASS_EXECUTION passes the pointer to the executed pass
(the same as current_pass) as 'gcc_data' to the callback.  You can also
inspect cfun to find out about which function this pass is executed for.
Note that this event will only be invoked if the gate check (if
applicable, modified by PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE) succeeds.  You can use
other hooks, like 'PLUGIN_ALL_PASSES_START', 'PLUGIN_ALL_PASSES_END',
'PLUGIN_ALL_IPA_PASSES_START', 'PLUGIN_ALL_IPA_PASSES_END',
'PLUGIN_EARLY_GIMPLE_PASSES_START', and/or
'PLUGIN_EARLY_GIMPLE_PASSES_END' to manipulate global state in your
plugin(s) in order to get context for the pass execution.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins gate,  Next: Plugins tracking,  Prev: Plugins recording,  Up: Plugins

23.8 Controlling which passes are being run
===========================================

After the original gate function for a pass is called, its result - the
gate status - is stored as an integer.  Then the event
'PLUGIN_OVERRIDE_GATE' is invoked, with a pointer to the gate status in
the 'gcc_data' parameter to the callback function.  A nonzero value of
the gate status means that the pass is to be executed.  You can both
read and write the gate status via the passed pointer.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins tracking,  Next: Plugins building,  Prev: Plugins gate,  Up: Plugins

23.9 Keeping track of available passes
======================================

When your plugin is loaded, you can inspect the various pass lists to
determine what passes are available.  However, other plugins might add
new passes.  Also, future changes to GCC might cause generic passes to
be added after plugin loading.  When a pass is first added to one of the
pass lists, the event 'PLUGIN_NEW_PASS' is invoked, with the callback
parameter 'gcc_data' pointing to the new pass.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Plugins building,  Prev: Plugins tracking,  Up: Plugins

23.10 Building GCC plugins
==========================

If plugins are enabled, GCC installs the headers needed to build a
plugin (somewhere in the installation tree, e.g.  under '/usr/local').
In particular a 'plugin/include' directory is installed, containing all
the header files needed to build plugins.

 On most systems, you can query this 'plugin' directory by invoking 'gcc
-print-file-name=plugin' (replace if needed 'gcc' with the appropriate
program path).

 Inside plugins, this 'plugin' directory name can be queried by calling
'default_plugin_dir_name ()'.

 Plugins may know, when they are compiled, the GCC version for which
'plugin-version.h' is provided.  The constant macros
'GCCPLUGIN_VERSION_MAJOR', 'GCCPLUGIN_VERSION_MINOR',
'GCCPLUGIN_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL', 'GCCPLUGIN_VERSION' are integer numbers,
so a plugin could ensure it is built for GCC 4.7 with
     #if GCCPLUGIN_VERSION != 4007
     #error this GCC plugin is for GCC 4.7
     #endif

 The following GNU Makefile excerpt shows how to build a simple plugin:

     HOST_GCC=g++
     TARGET_GCC=gcc
     PLUGIN_SOURCE_FILES= plugin1.c plugin2.cc
     GCCPLUGINS_DIR:= $(shell $(TARGET_GCC) -print-file-name=plugin)
     CXXFLAGS+= -I$(GCCPLUGINS_DIR)/include -fPIC -fno-rtti -O2

     plugin.so: $(PLUGIN_SOURCE_FILES)
        $(HOST_GCC) -shared $(CXXFLAGS) $^ -o $@

 A single source file plugin may be built with 'g++ -I`gcc
-print-file-name=plugin`/include -fPIC -shared -fno-rtti -O2 plugin.c -o
plugin.so', using backquote shell syntax to query the 'plugin'
directory.

 When a plugin needs to use 'gengtype', be sure that both 'gengtype' and
'gtype.state' have the same version as the GCC for which the plugin is
built.

24 Link Time Optimization
*************************

Link Time Optimization (LTO) gives GCC the capability of dumping its
internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk, so that all the different
compilation units that make up a single executable can be optimized as a
single module.  This expands the scope of inter-procedural optimizations
to encompass the whole program (or, rather, everything that is visible
at link time).

File: gccint.info,  Node: LTO Overview,  Next: LTO object file layout,  Up: LTO

24.1 Design Overview
====================

Link time optimization is implemented as a GCC front end for a bytecode
representation of GIMPLE that is emitted in special sections of '.o'
files.  Currently, LTO support is enabled in most ELF-based systems, as
well as darwin, cygwin and mingw systems.

 Since GIMPLE bytecode is saved alongside final object code, object
files generated with LTO support are larger than regular object files.
This "fat" object format makes it easy to integrate LTO into existing
build systems, as one can, for instance, produce archives of the files.
Additionally, one might be able to ship one set of fat objects which
could be used both for development and the production of optimized
builds.  A, perhaps surprising, side effect of this feature is that any
mistake in the toolchain that leads to LTO information not being used
(e.g. an older 'libtool' calling 'ld' directly).  This is both an
advantage, as the system is more robust, and a disadvantage, as the user
is not informed that the optimization has been disabled.

 The current implementation only produces "fat" objects, effectively
doubling compilation time and increasing file sizes up to 5x the
original size.  This hides the problem that some tools, such as 'ar' and
'nm', need to understand symbol tables of LTO sections.  These tools
were extended to use the plugin infrastructure, and with these problems
solved, GCC will also support "slim" objects consisting of the
intermediate code alone.

 At the highest level, LTO splits the compiler in two.  The first half
(the "writer") produces a streaming representation of all the internal
data structures needed to optimize and generate code.  This includes
declarations, types, the callgraph and the GIMPLE representation of
function bodies.

 When '-flto' is given during compilation of a source file, the pass
manager executes all the passes in 'all_lto_gen_passes'.  Currently,
this phase is composed of two IPA passes:

   * 'pass_ipa_lto_gimple_out' This pass executes the function
     'lto_output' in 'lto-streamer-out.c', which traverses the call
     graph encoding every reachable declaration, type and function.
     This generates a memory representation of all the file sections
     described below.

   * 'pass_ipa_lto_finish_out' This pass executes the function
     'produce_asm_for_decls' in 'lto-streamer-out.c', which takes the
     memory image built in the previous pass and encodes it in the
     corresponding ELF file sections.

 The second half of LTO support is the "reader".  This is implemented as
the GCC front end 'lto1' in 'lto/lto.c'.  When 'collect2' detects a link
set of '.o'/'.a' files with LTO information and the '-flto' is enabled,
it invokes 'lto1' which reads the set of files and aggregates them into
a single translation unit for optimization.  The main entry point for
the reader is 'lto/lto.c':'lto_main'.

24.1.1 LTO modes of operation
-----------------------------

One of the main goals of the GCC link-time infrastructure was to allow
effective compilation of large programs.  For this reason GCC implements
two link-time compilation modes.

  1. _LTO mode_, in which the whole program is read into the compiler at
     link-time and optimized in a similar way as if it were a single
     source-level compilation unit.

  2. _WHOPR or partitioned mode_, designed to utilize multiple CPUs
     and/or a distributed compilation environment to quickly link large
     applications.  WHOPR stands for WHOle Program optimizeR (not to be
     confused with the semantics of '-fwhole-program').  It partitions
     the aggregated callgraph from many different '.o' files and
     distributes the compilation of the sub-graphs to different CPUs.

     Note that distributed compilation is not implemented yet, but since
     the parallelism is facilitated via generating a 'Makefile', it
     would be easy to implement.

 WHOPR splits LTO into three main stages:
  1. Local generation (LGEN) This stage executes in parallel.  Every
     file in the program is compiled into the intermediate language and
     packaged together with the local call-graph and summary
     information.  This stage is the same for both the LTO and WHOPR
     compilation mode.

  2. Whole Program Analysis (WPA) WPA is performed sequentially.  The
     global call-graph is generated, and a global analysis procedure
     makes transformation decisions.  The global call-graph is
     partitioned to facilitate parallel optimization during phase 3.
     The results of the WPA stage are stored into new object files which
     contain the partitions of program expressed in the intermediate
     language and the optimization decisions.

  3. Local transformations (LTRANS) This stage executes in parallel.
     All the decisions made during phase 2 are implemented locally in
     each partitioned object file, and the final object code is
     generated.  Optimizations which cannot be decided efficiently
     during the phase 2 may be performed on the local call-graph
     partitions.

 WHOPR can be seen as an extension of the usual LTO mode of compilation.
In LTO, WPA and LTRANS are executed within a single execution of the
compiler, after the whole program has been read into memory.

 When compiling in WHOPR mode, the callgraph is partitioned during the
WPA stage.  The whole program is split into a given number of partitions
of roughly the same size.  The compiler tries to minimize the number of
references which cross partition boundaries.  The main advantage of
WHOPR is to allow the parallel execution of LTRANS stages, which are the
most time-consuming part of the compilation process.  Additionally, it
avoids the need to load the whole program into memory.

24.2 LTO file sections
======================

LTO information is stored in several ELF sections inside object files.
Data structures and enum codes for sections are defined in
'lto-streamer.h'.

 These sections are emitted from 'lto-streamer-out.c' and mapped in all
at once from 'lto/lto.c':'lto_file_read'.  The individual functions
dealing with the reading/writing of each section are described below.

   * Command line options ('.gnu.lto_.opts')

     This section contains the command line options used to generate the
     object files.  This is used at link time to determine the
     optimization level and other settings when they are not explicitly
     specified at the linker command line.

     Currently, GCC does not support combining LTO object files compiled
     with different set of the command line options into a single
     binary.  At link time, the options given on the command line and
     the options saved on all the files in a link-time set are applied
     globally.  No attempt is made at validating the combination of
     flags (other than the usual validation done by option processing).
     This is implemented in 'lto/lto.c':'lto_read_all_file_options'.

   * Symbol table ('.gnu.lto_.symtab')

     This table replaces the ELF symbol table for functions and
     variables represented in the LTO IL. Symbols used and exported by
     the optimized assembly code of "fat" objects might not match the
     ones used and exported by the intermediate code.  This table is
     necessary because the intermediate code is less optimized and thus
     requires a separate symbol table.

     Additionally, the binary code in the "fat" object will lack a call
     to a function, since the call was optimized out at compilation time
     after the intermediate language was streamed out.  In some special
     cases, the same optimization may not happen during link-time
     optimization.  This would lead to an undefined symbol if only one
     symbol table was used.

     The symbol table is emitted in
     'lto-streamer-out.c':'produce_symtab'.

   * Global declarations and types ('.gnu.lto_.decls')

     This section contains an intermediate language dump of all
     declarations and types required to represent the callgraph, static
     variables and top-level debug info.

     The contents of this section are emitted in
     'lto-streamer-out.c':'produce_asm_for_decls'.  Types and symbols
     are emitted in a topological order that preserves the sharing of
     pointers when the file is read back in
     ('lto.c':'read_cgraph_and_symbols').

   * The callgraph ('.gnu.lto_.cgraph')

     This section contains the basic data structure used by the GCC
     inter-procedural optimization infrastructure.  This section stores
     an annotated multi-graph which represents the functions and call
     sites as well as the variables, aliases and top-level 'asm'
     statements.

     This section is emitted in 'lto-streamer-out.c':'output_cgraph' and
     read in 'lto-cgraph.c':'input_cgraph'.

   * IPA references ('.gnu.lto_.refs')

     This section contains references between function and static
     variables.  It is emitted by 'lto-cgraph.c':'output_refs' and read
     by 'lto-cgraph.c':'input_refs'.

   * Function bodies ('.gnu.lto_.function_body.<name>')

     This section contains function bodies in the intermediate language
     representation.  Every function body is in a separate section to
     allow copying of the section independently to different object
     files or reading the function on demand.

     Functions are emitted in 'lto-streamer-out.c':'output_function' and
     read in 'lto-streamer-in.c':'input_function'.

   * Static variable initializers ('.gnu.lto_.vars')

     This section contains all the symbols in the global variable pool.
     It is emitted by 'lto-cgraph.c':'output_varpool' and read in
     'lto-cgraph.c':'input_cgraph'.

   * Summaries and optimization summaries used by IPA passes
     ('.gnu.lto_.<xxx>', where '<xxx>' is one of 'jmpfuncs', 'pureconst'
     or 'reference')

     These sections are used by IPA passes that need to emit summary
     information during LTO generation to be read and aggregated at link
     time.  Each pass is responsible for implementing two pass manager
     hooks: one for writing the summary and another for reading it in.
     The format of these sections is entirely up to each individual
     pass.  The only requirement is that the writer and reader hooks
     agree on the format.

24.3 Using summary information in IPA passes
============================================

Programs are represented internally as a _callgraph_ (a multi-graph
where nodes are functions and edges are call sites) and a _varpool_ (a
list of static and external variables in the program).

 The inter-procedural optimization is organized as a sequence of
individual passes, which operate on the callgraph and the varpool.  To
make the implementation of WHOPR possible, every inter-procedural
optimization pass is split into several stages that are executed at
different times during WHOPR compilation:

   * LGEN time
       1. _Generate summary_ ('generate_summary' in 'struct
          ipa_opt_pass_d').  This stage analyzes every function body and
          variable initializer is examined and stores relevant
          information into a pass-specific data structure.

       2. _Write summary_ ('write_summary' in 'struct ipa_opt_pass_d').
          This stage writes all the pass-specific information generated
          by 'generate_summary'.  Summaries go into their own
          'LTO_section_*' sections that have to be declared in
          'lto-streamer.h':'enum lto_section_type'.  A new section is
          created by calling 'create_output_block' and data can be
          written using the 'lto_output_*' routines.

   * WPA time
       1. _Read summary_ ('read_summary' in 'struct ipa_opt_pass_d').
          This stage reads all the pass-specific information in exactly
          the same order that it was written by 'write_summary'.

       2. _Execute_ ('execute' in 'struct opt_pass').  This performs
          inter-procedural propagation.  This must be done without
          actual access to the individual function bodies or variable
          initializers.  Typically, this results in a transitive closure
          operation over the summary information of all the nodes in the
          callgraph.

       3. _Write optimization summary_ ('write_optimization_summary' in
          'struct ipa_opt_pass_d').  This writes the result of the
          inter-procedural propagation into the object file.  This can
          use the same data structures and helper routines used in
          'write_summary'.

   * LTRANS time
       1. _Read optimization summary_ ('read_optimization_summary' in
          'struct ipa_opt_pass_d').  The counterpart to
          'write_optimization_summary'.  This reads the interprocedural
          optimization decisions in exactly the same format emitted by
          'write_optimization_summary'.

       2. _Transform_ ('function_transform' and 'variable_transform' in
          'struct ipa_opt_pass_d').  The actual function bodies and
          variable initializers are updated based on the information
          passed down from the _Execute_ stage.

 The implementation of the inter-procedural passes are shared between
LTO, WHOPR and classic non-LTO compilation.

   * During the traditional file-by-file mode every pass executes its
     own _Generate summary_, _Execute_, and _Transform_ stages within
     the single execution context of the compiler.

   * In LTO compilation mode, every pass uses _Generate summary_ and
     _Write summary_ stages at compilation time, while the _Read
     summary_, _Execute_, and _Transform_ stages are executed at link
     time.

   * In WHOPR mode all stages are used.

 To simplify development, the GCC pass manager differentiates between
normal inter-procedural passes and small inter-procedural passes.  A
_small inter-procedural pass_ ('SIMPLE_IPA_PASS') is a pass that does
everything at once and thus it can not be executed during WPA in WHOPR
mode.  It defines only the _Execute_ stage and during this stage it
accesses and modifies the function bodies.  Such passes are useful for
optimization at LGEN or LTRANS time and are used, for example, to
implement early optimization before writing object files.  The simple
inter-procedural passes can also be used for easier prototyping and
development of a new inter-procedural pass.

24.3.1 Virtual clones
---------------------

One of the main challenges of introducing the WHOPR compilation mode was
addressing the interactions between optimization passes.  In LTO
compilation mode, the passes are executed in a sequence, each of which
consists of analysis (or _Generate summary_), propagation (or _Execute_)
and _Transform_ stages.  Once the work of one pass is finished, the next
pass sees the updated program representation and can execute.  This
makes the individual passes dependent on each other.

 In WHOPR mode all passes first execute their _Generate summary_ stage.
Then summary writing marks the end of the LGEN stage.  At WPA time, the
summaries are read back into memory and all passes run the _Execute_
stage.  Optimization summaries are streamed and sent to LTRANS, where
all the passes execute the _Transform_ stage.

 Most optimization passes split naturally into analysis, propagation and
transformation stages.  But some do not.  The main problem arises when
one pass performs changes and the following pass gets confused by seeing
different callgraphs between the _Transform_ stage and the _Generate
summary_ or _Execute_ stage.  This means that the passes are required to
communicate their decisions with each other.

 To facilitate this communication, the GCC callgraph infrastructure
implements _virtual clones_, a method of representing the changes
performed by the optimization passes in the callgraph without needing to
update function bodies.

 A _virtual clone_ in the callgraph is a function that has no associated
body, just a description of how to create its body based on a different
function (which itself may be a virtual clone).

 The description of function modifications includes adjustments to the
function's signature (which allows, for example, removing or adding
function arguments), substitutions to perform on the function body, and,
for inlined functions, a pointer to the function that it will be inlined
into.

 It is also possible to redirect any edge of the callgraph from a
function to its virtual clone.  This implies updating of the call site
to adjust for the new function signature.

 Most of the transformations performed by inter-procedural optimizations
can be represented via virtual clones.  For instance, a constant
propagation pass can produce a virtual clone of the function which
replaces one of its arguments by a constant.  The inliner can represent
its decisions by producing a clone of a function whose body will be
later integrated into a given function.

 Using _virtual clones_, the program can be easily updated during the
_Execute_ stage, solving most of pass interactions problems that would
otherwise occur during _Transform_.

 Virtual clones are later materialized in the LTRANS stage and turned
into real functions.  Passes executed after the virtual clone were
introduced also perform their _Transform_ stage on new functions, so for
a pass there is no significant difference between operating on a real
function or a virtual clone introduced before its _Execute_ stage.

 Optimization passes then work on virtual clones introduced before their
_Execute_ stage as if they were real functions.  The only difference is
that clones are not visible during the _Generate Summary_ stage.

 To keep function summaries updated, the callgraph interface allows an
optimizer to register a callback that is called every time a new clone
is introduced as well as when the actual function or variable is
generated or when a function or variable is removed.  These hooks are
registered in the _Generate summary_ stage and allow the pass to keep
its information intact until the _Execute_ stage.  The same hooks can
also be registered during the _Execute_ stage to keep the optimization
summaries updated for the _Transform_ stage.

24.3.2 IPA references
---------------------

GCC represents IPA references in the callgraph.  For a function or
variable 'A', the _IPA reference_ is a list of all locations where the
address of 'A' is taken and, when 'A' is a variable, a list of all
direct stores and reads to/from 'A'.  References represent an oriented
multi-graph on the union of nodes of the callgraph and the varpool.  See
'ipa-reference.c':'ipa_reference_write_optimization_summary' and
'ipa-reference.c':'ipa_reference_read_optimization_summary' for details.

24.3.3 Jump functions
---------------------

Suppose that an optimization pass sees a function 'A' and it knows the
values of (some of) its arguments.  The _jump function_ describes the
value of a parameter of a given function call in function 'A' based on
this knowledge.

 Jump functions are used by several optimizations, such as the
inter-procedural constant propagation pass and the devirtualization
pass.  The inliner also uses jump functions to perform inlining of
callbacks.

24.4 Whole program assumptions, linker plugin and symbol visibilities
=====================================================================

Link-time optimization gives relatively minor benefits when used alone.
The problem is that propagation of inter-procedural information does not
work well across functions and variables that are called or referenced
by other compilation units (such as from a dynamically linked library).
We say that such functions and variables are _externally visible_.

 To make the situation even more difficult, many applications organize
themselves as a set of shared libraries, and the default ELF visibility
rules allow one to overwrite any externally visible symbol with a
different symbol at runtime.  This basically disables any optimizations
across such functions and variables, because the compiler cannot be sure
that the function body it is seeing is the same function body that will
be used at runtime.  Any function or variable not declared 'static' in
the sources degrades the quality of inter-procedural optimization.

 To avoid this problem the compiler must assume that it sees the whole
program when doing link-time optimization.  Strictly speaking, the whole
program is rarely visible even at link-time.  Standard system libraries
are usually linked dynamically or not provided with the link-time
information.  In GCC, the whole program option ('-fwhole-program')
asserts that every function and variable defined in the current
compilation unit is static, except for function 'main' (note: at link
time, the current unit is the union of all objects compiled with LTO).
Since some functions and variables need to be referenced externally, for
example by another DSO or from an assembler file, GCC also provides the
function and variable attribute 'externally_visible' which can be used
to disable the effect of '-fwhole-program' on a specific symbol.

 The whole program mode assumptions are slightly more complex in C++,
where inline functions in headers are put into _COMDAT_ sections.
COMDAT function and variables can be defined by multiple object files
and their bodies are unified at link-time and dynamic link-time.  COMDAT
functions are changed to local only when their address is not taken and
thus un-sharing them with a library is not harmful.  COMDAT variables
always remain externally visible, however for readonly variables it is
assumed that their initializers cannot be overwritten by a different
value.

 GCC provides the function and variable attribute 'visibility' that can
be used to specify the visibility of externally visible symbols (or
alternatively an '-fdefault-visibility' command line option).  ELF
defines the 'default', 'protected', 'hidden' and 'internal'
visibilities.

 The most commonly used is visibility is 'hidden'.  It specifies that
the symbol cannot be referenced from outside of the current shared
library.  Unfortunately, this information cannot be used directly by the
link-time optimization in the compiler since the whole shared library
also might contain non-LTO objects and those are not visible to the
compiler.

 GCC solves this problem using linker plugins.  A _linker plugin_ is an
interface to the linker that allows an external program to claim the
ownership of a given object file.  The linker then performs the linking
procedure by querying the plugin about the symbol table of the claimed
objects and once the linking decisions are complete, the plugin is
allowed to provide the final object file before the actual linking is
made.  The linker plugin obtains the symbol resolution information which
specifies which symbols provided by the claimed objects are bound from
the rest of a binary being linked.

 Currently, the linker plugin works only in combination with the Gold
linker, but a GNU ld implementation is under development.

 GCC is designed to be independent of the rest of the toolchain and aims
to support linkers without plugin support.  For this reason it does not
use the linker plugin by default.  Instead, the object files are
examined by 'collect2' before being passed to the linker and objects
found to have LTO sections are passed to 'lto1' first.  This mode does
not work for library archives.  The decision on what object files from
the archive are needed depends on the actual linking and thus GCC would
have to implement the linker itself.  The resolution information is
missing too and thus GCC needs to make an educated guess based on
'-fwhole-program'.  Without the linker plugin GCC also assumes that
symbols are declared 'hidden' and not referred by non-LTO code by
default.

24.5 Internal flags controlling 'lto1'
======================================

The following flags are passed into 'lto1' and are not meant to be used
directly from the command line.

   * -fwpa This option runs the serial part of the link-time optimizer
     performing the inter-procedural propagation (WPA mode).  The
     compiler reads in summary information from all inputs and performs
     an analysis based on summary information only.  It generates object
     files for subsequent runs of the link-time optimizer where
     individual object files are optimized using both summary
     information from the WPA mode and the actual function bodies.  It
     then drives the LTRANS phase.

   * -fltrans This option runs the link-time optimizer in the
     local-transformation (LTRANS) mode, which reads in output from a
     previous run of the LTO in WPA mode.  In the LTRANS mode, LTO
     optimizes an object and produces the final assembly.

   * -fltrans-output-list=FILE This option specifies a file to which the
     names of LTRANS output files are written.  This option is only
     meaningful in conjunction with '-fwpa'.

   * -fresolution=FILE This option specifies the linker resolution file.
     This option is only meaningful in conjunction with '-fwpa' and as
     option to pass through to the LTO linker plugin.

Funding Free Software
*********************

If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

 Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

 The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors they
must compete to be the one who gives the most.

 To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

 Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.  If
the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less
than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

 Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful
too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do,
and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute
more; major new features or packages contribute the most.

 By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.  (GNU is a
recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".)
Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are
now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as "Linux",
they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.

     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

 If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

 The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU Free Documentation License
******************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license

Option Index
************

GCC's command line options are indexed here without any initial '-' or
'--'.  Where an option has both positive and negative forms (such as
'-fOPTION' and '-fno-OPTION'), relevant entries in the manual are
indexed under the most appropriate form; it may sometimes be useful to
look up both forms.

Summary of GDB
**************

The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is
going on "inside" another program while it executes--or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.

   GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

   * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
     behavior.

   * Make your program stop on specified conditions.

   * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

   * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with
     correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

   You can use GDB to debug programs written in C and C++.  For more
information, see *note Supported Languages: Supported Languages.  For
more information, see *note C and C++: C.

   Support for D is partial.  For information on D, see *note D: D.

   Support for Modula-2 is partial.  For information on Modula-2, see
*note Modula-2: Modula-2.

   Support for OpenCL C is partial.  For information on OpenCL C, see
*note OpenCL C: OpenCL C.

   Debugging Pascal programs which use sets, subranges, file variables,
or nested functions does not currently work.  GDB does not support
entering expressions, printing values, or similar features using Pascal
syntax.

   GDB can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, although it may
be necessary to refer to some variables with a trailing underscore.

   GDB can be used to debug programs written in Objective-C, using
either the Apple/NeXT or the GNU Objective-C runtime.

Free Software
=============

GDB is "free software", protected by the GNU General Public License
(GPL). The GPL gives you the freedom to copy or adapt a licensed
program--but every person getting a copy also gets with it the freedom
to modify that copy (which means that they must get access to the source
code), and the freedom to distribute further copies.  Typical software
companies use copyrights to limit your freedoms; the Free Software
Foundation uses the GPL to preserve these freedoms.

   Fundamentally, the General Public License is a license which says
that you have these freedoms and that you cannot take these freedoms
away from anyone else.

Free Software Needs Free Documentation
======================================

The biggest deficiency in the free software community today is not in
the software--it is the lack of good free documentation that we can
include with the free software.  Many of our most important programs do
not come with free reference manuals and free introductory texts.
Documentation is an essential part of any software package; when an
important free software package does not come with a free manual and a
free tutorial, that is a major gap.  We have many such gaps today.

   Consider Perl, for instance.  The tutorial manuals that people
normally use are non-free.  How did this come about?  Because the
authors of those manuals published them with restrictive terms--no
copying, no modification, source files not available--which exclude them
from the free software world.

   That wasn't the first time this sort of thing happened, and it was
far from the last.  Many times we have heard a GNU user eagerly describe
a manual that he is writing, his intended contribution to the community,
only to learn that he had ruined everything by signing a publication
contract to make it non-free.

   Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not
price.  The problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers
charge a price for printed copies--that in itself is fine.  (The Free
Software Foundation sells printed copies of manuals, too.)  The problem
is the restrictions on the use of the manual.  Free manuals are
available in source code form, and give you permission to copy and
modify.  Non-free manuals do not allow this.

   The criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for
free software.  Redistribution (including the normal kinds of commercial
redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can accompany
every copy of the program, both on-line and on paper.

   Permission for modification of the technical content is crucial too.
When people modify the software, adding or changing features, if they
are conscientious they will change the manual too--so they can provide
accurate and clear documentation for the modified program.  A manual
that leaves you no choice but to write a new manual to document a
changed version of the program is not really available to our community.

   Some kinds of limits on the way modification is handled are
acceptable.  For example, requirements to preserve the original author's
copyright notice, the distribution terms, or the list of authors, are
ok.  It is also no problem to require modified versions to include
notice that they were modified.  Even entire sections that may not be
deleted or changed are acceptable, as long as they deal with
nontechnical topics (like this one).  These kinds of restrictions are
acceptable because they don't obstruct the community's normal use of the
manual.

   However, it must be possible to modify all the _technical_ content of
the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual media,
through all the usual channels.  Otherwise, the restrictions obstruct
the use of the manual, it is not free, and we need another manual to
replace it.

   Please spread the word about this issue.  Our community continues to
lose manuals to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that free
software needs free reference manuals and free tutorials, perhaps the
next person who wants to contribute by writing documentation will
realize, before it is too late, that only free manuals contribute to the
free software community.

   If you are writing documentation, please insist on publishing it
under the GNU Free Documentation License or another free documentation
license.  Remember that this decision requires your approval--you don't
have to let the publisher decide.  Some commercial publishers will use a
free license if you insist, but they will not propose the option; it is
up to you to raise the issue and say firmly that this is what you want.
If the publisher you are dealing with refuses, please try other
publishers.  If you're not sure whether a proposed license is free,
write to <licensing@gnu.org>.

   You can encourage commercial publishers to sell more free, copylefted
manuals and tutorials by buying them, and particularly by buying copies
from the publishers that paid for their writing or for major
improvements.  Meanwhile, try to avoid buying non-free documentation at
all.  Check the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it, and
insist that whoever seeks your business must respect your freedom.
Check the history of the book, and try to reward the publishers that
have paid or pay the authors to work on it.

Contributors to GDB
===================

Richard Stallman was the original author of GDB, and of many other GNU
programs.  Many others have contributed to its development.  This
section attempts to credit major contributors.  One of the virtues of
free software is that everyone is free to contribute to it; with regret,
we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The file 'ChangeLog' in
the GDB distribution approximates a blow-by-blow account.

   Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.

     _Plea:_ Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
     or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
     omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!

   So that they may not regard their many labors as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded GDB through major releases:
Andrew Cagney (releases 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0); Jim
Blandy (release 4.18); Jason Molenda (release 4.17); Stan Shebs (release
4.14); Fred Fish (releases 4.16, 4.15, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9);

1 A Sample GDB Session
**********************

You can use this manual at your leisure to read all about GDB.  However,
a handful of commands are enough to get started using the debugger.
This chapter illustrates those commands.

   One of the preliminary versions of GNU 'm4' (a generic macro
processor) exhibits the following bug: sometimes, when we change its
quote strings from the default, the commands used to capture one macro
definition within another stop working.  In the following short 'm4'
session, we define a macro 'foo' which expands to '0000'; we then use
the 'm4' built-in 'defn' to define 'bar' as the same thing.  However,
when we change the open quote string to '<QUOTE>' and the close quote
string to '<UNQUOTE>', the same procedure fails to define a new synonym
'baz':

     $ cd gnu/m4
     $ ./m4
     define(foo,0000)

     foo
     0000
     define(bar,defn('foo'))

     bar
     0000
     changequote(<QUOTE>,<UNQUOTE>)

     define(baz,defn(<QUOTE>foo<UNQUOTE>))
     baz
     Ctrl-d
     m4: End of input: 0: fatal error: EOF in string

Let us use GDB to try to see what is going on.

     $ gdb m4
     GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies
      of it under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see
      the conditions.
     There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type "show warranty"
      for details.

     GDB 7.8.1, Copyright 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
     (gdb)

GDB reads only enough symbol data to know where to find the rest when
needed; as a result, the first prompt comes up very quickly.  We now
tell GDB to use a narrower display width than usual, so that examples
fit in this manual.

     (gdb) set width 70

We need to see how the 'm4' built-in 'changequote' works.  Having looked
at the source, we know the relevant subroutine is 'm4_changequote', so
we set a breakpoint there with the GDB 'break' command.

     (gdb) break m4_changequote
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x62f4: file builtin.c, line 879.

Using the 'run' command, we start 'm4' running under GDB control; as
long as control does not reach the 'm4_changequote' subroutine, the
program runs as usual:

     (gdb) run
     Starting program: /work/Editorial/gdb/gnu/m4/m4
     define(foo,0000)

     foo
     0000

To trigger the breakpoint, we call 'changequote'.  GDB suspends
execution of 'm4', displaying information about the context where it
stops.

     changequote(<QUOTE>,<UNQUOTE>)

     Breakpoint 1, m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
         at builtin.c:879
     879         if (bad_argc(TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[0]),argc,1,3))

Now we use the command 'n' ('next') to advance execution to the next
line of the current function.

     (gdb) n
     882         set_quotes((argc >= 2) ? TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[1])\
      : nil,

'set_quotes' looks like a promising subroutine.  We can go into it by
using the command 's' ('step') instead of 'next'.  'step' goes to the
next line to be executed in _any_ subroutine, so it steps into
'set_quotes'.

     (gdb) s
     set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "<QUOTE>", rq=0x34c88 "<UNQUOTE>")
         at input.c:530
     530         if (lquote != def_lquote)

The display that shows the subroutine where 'm4' is now suspended (and
its arguments) is called a stack frame display.  It shows a summary of
the stack.  We can use the 'backtrace' command (which can also be
spelled 'bt'), to see where we are in the stack as a whole: the
'backtrace' command displays a stack frame for each active subroutine.

     (gdb) bt
     #0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "<QUOTE>", rq=0x34c88 "<UNQUOTE>")
         at input.c:530
     #1  0x6344 in m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
         at builtin.c:882
     #2  0x8174 in expand_macro (sym=0x33320) at macro.c:242
     #3  0x7a88 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=209696, td=0xf7fffa30)
         at macro.c:71
     #4  0x79dc in expand_input () at macro.c:40
     #5  0x2930 in main (argc=0, argv=0xf7fffb20) at m4.c:195

We step through a few more lines to see what happens.  The first two
times, we can use 's'; the next two times we use 'n' to avoid falling
into the 'xstrdup' subroutine.

     (gdb) s
     0x3b5c  532         if (rquote != def_rquote)
     (gdb) s
     0x3b80  535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ?  \
     def_lquote : xstrdup(lq);
     (gdb) n
     536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
      : xstrdup(rq);
     (gdb) n
     538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);

The last line displayed looks a little odd; we can examine the variables
'lquote' and 'rquote' to see if they are in fact the new left and right
quotes we specified.  We use the command 'p' ('print') to see their
values.

     (gdb) p lquote
     $1 = 0x35d40 "<QUOTE>"
     (gdb) p rquote
     $2 = 0x35d50 "<UNQUOTE>"

'lquote' and 'rquote' are indeed the new left and right quotes.  To look
at some context, we can display ten lines of source surrounding the
current line with the 'l' ('list') command.

     (gdb) l
     533             xfree(rquote);
     534
     535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == '\0') ? def_lquote\
      : xstrdup (lq);
     536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == '\0') ? def_rquote\
      : xstrdup (rq);
     537
     538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
     539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
     540     }
     541
     542     void

Let us step past the two lines that set 'len_lquote' and 'len_rquote',
and then examine the values of those variables.

     (gdb) n
     539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
     (gdb) n
     540     }
     (gdb) p len_lquote
     $3 = 9
     (gdb) p len_rquote
     $4 = 7

That certainly looks wrong, assuming 'len_lquote' and 'len_rquote' are
meant to be the lengths of 'lquote' and 'rquote' respectively.  We can
set them to better values using the 'p' command, since it can print the
value of any expression--and that expression can include subroutine
calls and assignments.

     (gdb) p len_lquote=strlen(lquote)
     $5 = 7
     (gdb) p len_rquote=strlen(rquote)
     $6 = 9

Is that enough to fix the problem of using the new quotes with the 'm4'
built-in 'defn'?  We can allow 'm4' to continue executing with the 'c'
('continue') command, and then try the example that caused trouble
initially:

     (gdb) c
     Continuing.

     define(baz,defn(<QUOTE>foo<UNQUOTE>))

     baz
     0000

Success!  The new quotes now work just as well as the default ones.  The
problem seems to have been just the two typos defining the wrong
lengths.  We allow 'm4' exit by giving it an EOF as input:

     Ctrl-d
     Program exited normally.

The message 'Program exited normally.' is from GDB; it indicates 'm4'
has finished executing.  We can end our GDB session with the GDB 'quit'
command.

     (gdb) quit

2 Getting In and Out of GDB
***************************

This chapter discusses how to start GDB, and how to get out of it.  The
essentials are:
   * type 'gdb' to start GDB.
   * type 'quit' or 'Ctrl-d' to exit.

* Menu:

* Invoking GDB::                How to start GDB

* Shell Commands::              How to use shell commands inside GDB
* Logging Output::              How to log GDB's output to a file


File: gdb.info,  Node: Invoking GDB,  Next: Quitting GDB,  Up: Invocation

2.1 Invoking GDB
================

Invoke GDB by running the program 'gdb'.  Once started, GDB reads
commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.

   You can also run 'gdb' with a variety of arguments and options, to
specify more of your debugging environment at the outset.

   The command-line options described here are designed to cover a
variety of situations; in some environments, some of these options may
effectively be unavailable.

   The most usual way to start GDB is with one argument, specifying an
executable program:

     gdb PROGRAM

You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
specified:

     gdb PROGRAM CORE

   You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you
want to debug a running process:

     gdb PROGRAM 1234

would attach GDB to process '1234' (unless you also have a file named
'1234'; GDB does check for a core file first).

   Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a
fairly complete operating system; when you use GDB as a remote debugger
attached to a bare board, there may not be any notion of "process", and
there is often no way to get a core dump.  GDB will warn you if it is
unable to attach or to read core dumps.

   You can optionally have 'gdb' pass any arguments after the executable
file to the inferior using '--args'.  This option stops option
processing.
     gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c
   This will cause 'gdb' to debug 'gcc', and to set 'gcc''s command-line
arguments (*note Arguments::) to '-O2 -c foo.c'.

   You can run 'gdb' without printing the front material, which
describes GDB's non-warranty, by specifying '--silent' (or
'-q'/'--quiet'):

     gdb --silent

You can further control how GDB starts up by using command-line options.
GDB itself can remind you of the options available.

Type

     gdb -help

to display all available options and briefly describe their use ('gdb
-h' is a shorter equivalent).

   All options and command line arguments you give are processed in
sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the '-x' option is
used.

* Mode Options::                Choosing modes
* Startup::                     What GDB does during startup


File: gdb.info,  Node: File Options,  Next: Mode Options,  Up: Invoking GDB

2.1.1 Choosing Files
--------------------

When GDB starts, it reads any arguments other than options as specifying
an executable file and core file (or process ID). This is the same as if
the arguments were specified by the '-se' and '-c' (or '-p') options
respectively.  (GDB reads the first argument that does not have an
associated option flag as equivalent to the '-se' option followed by
that argument; and the second argument that does not have an associated
option flag, if any, as equivalent to the '-c'/'-p' option followed by
that argument.)  If the second argument begins with a decimal digit, GDB
will first attempt to attach to it as a process, and if that fails,
attempt to open it as a corefile.  If you have a corefile whose name
begins with a digit, you can prevent GDB from treating it as a pid by
prefixing it with './', e.g. './12345'.

   If GDB has not been configured to included core file support, such as
for most embedded targets, then it will complain about a second argument
and ignore it.

   Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown in the
following list.  GDB also recognizes the long forms if you truncate
them, so long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.  (If
you prefer, you can flag option arguments with '--' rather than '-',
though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

'-symbols FILE'
'-s FILE'
     Read symbol table from file FILE.

'-exec FILE'
'-e FILE'
     Use file FILE as the executable file to execute when appropriate,
     and for examining pure data in conjunction with a core dump.

'-se FILE'
     Read symbol table from file FILE and use it as the executable file.

'-core FILE'
'-c FILE'
     Use file FILE as a core dump to examine.

'-pid NUMBER'
'-p NUMBER'
     Connect to process ID NUMBER, as with the 'attach' command.

'-command FILE'
'-x FILE'
     Execute commands from file FILE.  The contents of this file is
     evaluated exactly as the 'source' command would.  *Note Command
     files: Command Files.

'-eval-command COMMAND'
'-ex COMMAND'
     Execute a single GDB command.

     This option may be used multiple times to call multiple commands.
     It may also be interleaved with '-command' as required.

          gdb -ex 'target sim' -ex 'load' \
             -x setbreakpoints -ex 'run' a.out

'-init-command FILE'
'-ix FILE'
     Execute commands from file FILE before loading the inferior (but
     after loading gdbinit files).  *Note Startup::.

'-init-eval-command COMMAND'
'-iex COMMAND'
     Execute a single GDB command before loading the inferior (but after
     loading gdbinit files).  *Note Startup::.

'-directory DIRECTORY'
'-d DIRECTORY'
     Add DIRECTORY to the path to search for source and script files.

'-r'
'-readnow'
     Read each symbol file's entire symbol table immediately, rather
     than the default, which is to read it incrementally as it is
     needed.  This makes startup slower, but makes future operations
     faster.

2.1.2 Choosing Modes
--------------------

You can run GDB in various alternative modes--for example, in batch mode
or quiet mode.

'-nx'
'-n'
     Do not execute commands found in any initialization file.  There
     are three init files, loaded in the following order:

     'system.gdbinit'
          This is the system-wide init file.  Its location is specified
          with the '--with-system-gdbinit' configure option (*note
          System-wide configuration::).  It is loaded first when GDB
          starts, before command line options have been processed.
     '~/.gdbinit'
          This is the init file in your home directory.  It is loaded
          next, after 'system.gdbinit', and before command options have
          been processed.
     './.gdbinit'
          This is the init file in the current directory.  It is loaded
          last, after command line options other than '-x' and '-ex'
          have been processed.  Command line options '-x' and '-ex' are
          processed last, after './.gdbinit' has been loaded.

     For further documentation on startup processing, *Note Startup::.
     For documentation on how to write command files, *Note Command
     Files: Command Files.

'-nh'
     Do not execute commands found in '~/.gdbinit', the init file in
     your home directory.  *Note Startup::.

'-quiet'
'-silent'
'-q'
     "Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.
     These messages are also suppressed in batch mode.

'-batch'
     Run in batch mode.  Exit with status '0' after processing all the
     command files specified with '-x' (and all commands from
     initialization files, if not inhibited with '-n').  Exit with
     nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the GDB commands in
     the command files.  Batch mode also disables pagination, sets
     unlimited terminal width and height *note Screen Size::, and acts
     as if 'set confirm off' were in effect (*note Messages/Warnings::).

     Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example
     to download and run a program on another computer; in order to make
     this more useful, the message

          Program exited normally.

     (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB
     control terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.

'-batch-silent'
     Run in batch mode exactly like '-batch', but totally silently.  All
     GDB output to 'stdout' is prevented ('stderr' is unaffected).  This
     is much quieter than '-silent' and would be useless for an
     interactive session.

     This is particularly useful when using targets that give 'Loading
     section' messages, for example.

     Note that targets that give their output via GDB, as opposed to
     writing directly to 'stdout', will also be made silent.

'-return-child-result'
     The return code from GDB will be the return code from the child
     process (the process being debugged), with the following
     exceptions:

        * GDB exits abnormally.  E.g., due to an incorrect argument or
          an internal error.  In this case the exit code is the same as
          it would have been without '-return-child-result'.
        * The user quits with an explicit value.  E.g., 'quit 1'.
        * The child process never runs, or is not allowed to terminate,
          in which case the exit code will be -1.

     This option is useful in conjunction with '-batch' or
     '-batch-silent', when GDB is being used as a remote program loader
     or simulator interface.

'-nowindows'
'-nw'
     "No windows".  If GDB comes with a graphical user interface (GUI)
     built in, then this option tells GDB to only use the command-line
     interface.  If no GUI is available, this option has no effect.

'-windows'
'-w'
     If GDB includes a GUI, then this option requires it to be used if
     possible.

'-cd DIRECTORY'
     Run GDB using DIRECTORY as its working directory, instead of the
     current directory.

'-data-directory DIRECTORY'
'-D DIRECTORY'
     Run GDB using DIRECTORY as its data directory.  The data directory
     is where GDB searches for its auxiliary files.  *Note Data Files::.

'-fullname'
'-f'
     GNU Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It
     tells GDB to output the full file name and line number in a
     standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed
     (which includes each time your program stops).  This recognizable
     format looks like two '\032' characters, followed by the file name,
     line number and character position separated by colons, and a
     newline.  The Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two '\032'
     characters as a signal to display the source code for the frame.

'-annotate LEVEL'
     This option sets the "annotation level" inside GDB.  Its effect is
     identical to using 'set annotate LEVEL' (*note Annotations::).  The
     annotation LEVEL controls how much information GDB prints together
     with its prompt, values of expressions, source lines, and other
     types of output.  Level 0 is the normal, level 1 is for use when
     GDB is run as a subprocess of GNU Emacs, level 3 is the maximum
     annotation suitable for programs that control GDB, and level 2 has
     been deprecated.

     The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by GDB/MI
     (*note GDB/MI::).

'--args'
     Change interpretation of command line so that arguments following
     the executable file are passed as command line arguments to the
     inferior.  This option stops option processing.

'-baud BPS'
'-b BPS'
     Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial
     interface used by GDB for remote debugging.

'-l TIMEOUT'
     Set the timeout (in seconds) of any communication used by GDB for
     remote debugging.

'-tty DEVICE'
'-t DEVICE'
     Run using DEVICE for your program's standard input and output.

'-tui'
     Activate the "Text User Interface" when starting.  The Text User
     Interface manages several text windows on the terminal, showing
     source, assembly, registers and GDB command outputs (*note GDB Text
     User Interface: TUI.).  Do not use this option if you run GDB from
     Emacs (*note Using GDB under GNU Emacs: Emacs.).

'-interpreter INTERP'
     Use the interpreter INTERP for interface with the controlling
     program or device.  This option is meant to be set by programs
     which communicate with GDB using it as a back end.  *Note Command
     Interpreters: Interpreters.

     '--interpreter=mi' (or '--interpreter=mi2') causes GDB to use the
     "GDB/MI interface" (*note The GDB/MI Interface: GDB/MI.) included
     since GDB version 6.0.  The previous GDB/MI interface, included in
     GDB version 5.3 and selected with '--interpreter=mi1', is
     deprecated.  Earlier GDB/MI interfaces are no longer supported.

'-write'
     Open the executable and core files for both reading and writing.
     This is equivalent to the 'set write on' command inside GDB (*note
     Patching::).

'-statistics'
     This option causes GDB to print statistics about time and memory
     usage after it completes each command and returns to the prompt.

'-version'
     This option causes GDB to print its version number and no-warranty
     blurb, and exit.

'-configuration'
     This option causes GDB to print details about its build-time
     configuration parameters, and then exit.  These details can be
     important when reporting GDB bugs (*note GDB Bugs::).

2.1.3 What GDB Does During Startup
----------------------------------

Here's the description of what GDB does during session startup:

  1. Sets up the command interpreter as specified by the command line
     (*note interpreter: Mode Options.).

  2. Reads the system-wide "init file" (if '--with-system-gdbinit' was
     used when building GDB; *note System-wide configuration and
     settings: System-wide configuration.) and executes all the commands
     in that file.

  3. Reads the init file (if any) in your home directory(1) and executes
     all the commands in that file.

  4. Executes commands and command files specified by the '-iex' and
     '-ix' options in their specified order.  Usually you should use the
     '-ex' and '-x' options instead, but this way you can apply settings
     before GDB init files get executed and before inferior gets loaded.

  5. Processes command line options and operands.

  6. Reads and executes the commands from init file (if any) in the
     current working directory as long as 'set auto-load local-gdbinit'
     is set to 'on' (*note Init File in the Current Directory::).  This
     is only done if the current directory is different from your home
     directory.  Thus, you can have more than one init file, one generic
     in your home directory, and another, specific to the program you
     are debugging, in the directory where you invoke GDB.

  7. If the command line specified a program to debug, or a process to
     attach to, or a core file, GDB loads any auto-loaded scripts
     provided for the program or for its loaded shared libraries.  *Note
     Auto-loading::.

     If you wish to disable the auto-loading during startup, you must do
     something like the following:

          $ gdb -iex "set auto-load python-scripts off" myprogram

     Option '-ex' does not work because the auto-loading is then turned
     off too late.

  8. Executes commands and command files specified by the '-ex' and '-x'
     options in their specified order.  *Note Command Files::, for more
     details about GDB command files.

  9. Reads the command history recorded in the "history file".  *Note
     Command History::, for more details about the command history and
     the files where GDB records it.

   Init files use the same syntax as "command files" (*note Command
Files::) and are processed by GDB in the same way.  The init file in
your home directory can set options (such as 'set complaints') that
affect subsequent processing of command line options and operands.  Init
files are not executed if you use the '-nx' option (*note Choosing
Modes: Mode Options.).

   To display the list of init files loaded by gdb at startup, you can
use 'gdb --help'.

   The GDB init files are normally called '.gdbinit'.  The DJGPP port of
GDB uses the name 'gdb.ini', due to the limitations of file names
imposed by DOS filesystems.  The Windows port of GDB uses the standard
name, but if it finds a 'gdb.ini' file in your home directory, it warns
you about that and suggests to rename the file to the standard name.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On DOS/Windows systems, the home directory is the one pointed to
by the 'HOME' environment variable.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Quitting GDB,  Next: Shell Commands,  Prev: Invoking GDB,  Up: Invocation

2.2 Quitting GDB
================

'quit [EXPRESSION]'
'q'
     To exit GDB, use the 'quit' command (abbreviated 'q'), or type an
     end-of-file character (usually 'Ctrl-d').  If you do not supply
     EXPRESSION, GDB will terminate normally; otherwise it will
     terminate using the result of EXPRESSION as the error code.

   An interrupt (often 'Ctrl-c') does not exit from GDB, but rather
terminates the action of any GDB command that is in progress and returns
to GDB command level.  It is safe to type the interrupt character at any
time because GDB does not allow it to take effect until a time when it
is safe.

   If you have been using GDB to control an attached process or device,
you can release it with the 'detach' command (*note Debugging an
Already-running Process: Attach.).


File: gdb.info,  Node: Shell Commands,  Next: Logging Output,  Prev: Quitting GDB,  Up: Invocation

2.3 Shell Commands
==================

If you need to execute occasional shell commands during your debugging
session, there is no need to leave or suspend GDB; you can just use the
'shell' command.

'shell COMMAND-STRING'
'!COMMAND-STRING'
     Invoke a standard shell to execute COMMAND-STRING.  Note that no
     space is needed between '!' and COMMAND-STRING.  If it exists, the
     environment variable 'SHELL' determines which shell to run.
     Otherwise GDB uses the default shell ('/bin/sh' on Unix systems,
     'COMMAND.COM' on MS-DOS, etc.).

   The utility 'make' is often needed in development environments.  You
do not have to use the 'shell' command for this purpose in GDB:

'make MAKE-ARGS'
     Execute the 'make' program with the specified arguments.  This is
     equivalent to 'shell make MAKE-ARGS'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Logging Output,  Prev: Shell Commands,  Up: Invocation

2.4 Logging Output
==================

You may want to save the output of GDB commands to a file.  There are
several commands to control GDB's logging.

'set logging on'
     Enable logging.
'set logging off'
     Disable logging.
'set logging file FILE'
     Change the name of the current logfile.  The default logfile is
     'gdb.txt'.
'set logging overwrite [on|off]'
     By default, GDB will append to the logfile.  Set 'overwrite' if you
     want 'set logging on' to overwrite the logfile instead.
'set logging redirect [on|off]'
     By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the
     logfile.  Set 'redirect' if you want output to go only to the log
     file.
'show logging'
     Show the current values of the logging settings.

3 GDB Commands
**************

You can abbreviate a GDB command to the first few letters of the command
name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous; and you can repeat certain
GDB commands by typing just <RET>.  You can also use the <TAB> key to
get GDB to fill out the rest of a word in a command (or to show you the
alternatives available, if there is more than one possibility).

* Menu:

* Command Syntax::              How to give commands to GDB
* Completion::                  Command completion
* Help::                        How to ask GDB for help


File: gdb.info,  Node: Command Syntax,  Next: Completion,  Up: Commands

3.1 Command Syntax
==================

A GDB command is a single line of input.  There is no limit on how long
it can be.  It starts with a command name, which is followed by
arguments whose meaning depends on the command name.  For example, the
command 'step' accepts an argument which is the number of times to step,
as in 'step 5'.  You can also use the 'step' command with no arguments.
Some commands do not allow any arguments.

   GDB command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is
unambiguous.  Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the
documentation for individual commands.  In some cases, even ambiguous
abbreviations are allowed; for example, 's' is specially defined as
equivalent to 'step' even though there are other commands whose names
start with 's'.  You can test abbreviations by using them as arguments
to the 'help' command.

   A blank line as input to GDB (typing just <RET>) means to repeat the
previous command.  Certain commands (for example, 'run') will not repeat
this way; these are commands whose unintentional repetition might cause
trouble and which you are unlikely to want to repeat.  User-defined
commands can disable this feature; see *note dont-repeat: Define.

   The 'list' and 'x' commands, when you repeat them with <RET>,
construct new arguments rather than repeating exactly as typed.  This
permits easy scanning of source or memory.

   GDB can also use <RET> in another way: to partition lengthy output,
in a way similar to the common utility 'more' (*note Screen Size: Screen
Size.).  Since it is easy to press one <RET> too many in this situation,
GDB disables command repetition after any command that generates this
sort of display.

   Any text from a '#' to the end of the line is a comment; it does
nothing.  This is useful mainly in command files (*note Command Files:
Command Files.).

   The 'Ctrl-o' binding is useful for repeating a complex sequence of
commands.  This command accepts the current line, like <RET>, and then
fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history for
editing.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Completion,  Next: Help,  Prev: Command Syntax,  Up: Commands

3.2 Command Completion
======================

GDB can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is
only one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities
are for the next word in a command, at any time.  This works for GDB
commands, GDB subcommands, and the names of symbols in your program.

   Press the <TAB> key whenever you want GDB to fill out the rest of a
word.  If there is only one possibility, GDB fills in the word, and
waits for you to finish the command (or press <RET> to enter it).  For
example, if you type

     (gdb) info bre <TAB>

GDB fills in the rest of the word 'breakpoints', since that is the only
'info' subcommand beginning with 'bre':

     (gdb) info breakpoints

You can either press <RET> at this point, to run the 'info breakpoints'
command, or backspace and enter something else, if 'breakpoints' does
not look like the command you expected.  (If you were sure you wanted
'info breakpoints' in the first place, you might as well just type <RET>
immediately after 'info bre', to exploit command abbreviations rather
than command completion).

   If there is more than one possibility for the next word when you
press <TAB>, GDB sounds a bell.  You can either supply more characters
and try again, or just press <TAB> a second time; GDB displays all the
possible completions for that word.  For example, you might want to set
a breakpoint on a subroutine whose name begins with 'make_', but when
you type 'b make_<TAB>' GDB just sounds the bell.  Typing <TAB> again
displays all the function names in your program that begin with those
characters, for example:

     (gdb) b make_ <TAB>
GDB sounds bell; press <TAB> again, to see:
     make_a_section_from_file     make_environ
     make_abs_section             make_function_type
     make_blockvector             make_pointer_type
     make_cleanup                 make_reference_type
     make_command                 make_symbol_completion_list
     (gdb) b make_

After displaying the available possibilities, GDB copies your partial
input ('b make_' in the example) so you can finish the command.

   If you just want to see the list of alternatives in the first place,
you can press 'M-?' rather than pressing <TAB> twice.  'M-?' means
'<META> ?'.  You can type this either by holding down a key designated
as the <META> shift on your keyboard (if there is one) while typing '?',
or as <ESC> followed by '?'.

   Sometimes the string you need, while logically a "word", may contain
parentheses or other characters that GDB normally excludes from its
notion of a word.  To permit word completion to work in this situation,
you may enclose words in ''' (single quote marks) in GDB commands.

   The most likely situation where you might need this is in typing the
name of a C++ function.  This is because C++ allows function overloading
(multiple definitions of the same function, distinguished by argument
type).  For example, when you want to set a breakpoint you may need to
distinguish whether you mean the version of 'name' that takes an 'int'
parameter, 'name(int)', or the version that takes a 'float' parameter,
'name(float)'.  To use the word-completion facilities in this situation,
type a single quote ''' at the beginning of the function name.  This
alerts GDB that it may need to consider more information than usual when
you press <TAB> or 'M-?' to request word completion:

     (gdb) b 'bubble( M-?
     bubble(double,double)    bubble(int,int)
     (gdb) b 'bubble(

   In some cases, GDB can tell that completing a name requires using
quotes.  When this happens, GDB inserts the quote for you (while
completing as much as it can) if you do not type the quote in the first
place:

     (gdb) b bub <TAB>
GDB alters your input line to the following, and rings a bell:
     (gdb) b 'bubble(

In general, GDB can tell that a quote is needed (and inserts it) if you
have not yet started typing the argument list when you ask for
completion on an overloaded symbol.

   For more information about overloaded functions, see *note C++
Expressions: C Plus Plus Expressions.  You can use the command 'set
overload-resolution off' to disable overload resolution; see *note GDB
Features for C++: Debugging C Plus Plus.

   When completing in an expression which looks up a field in a
structure, GDB also tries(1) to limit completions to the field names
available in the type of the left-hand-side:

     (gdb) p gdb_stdout.M-?
     magic                to_fputs             to_rewind
     to_data              to_isatty            to_write
     to_delete            to_put               to_write_async_safe
     to_flush             to_read

This is because the 'gdb_stdout' is a variable of the type 'struct
ui_file' that is defined in GDB sources as follows:

     struct ui_file
     {
        int *magic;
        ui_file_flush_ftype *to_flush;
        ui_file_write_ftype *to_write;
        ui_file_write_async_safe_ftype *to_write_async_safe;
        ui_file_fputs_ftype *to_fputs;
        ui_file_read_ftype *to_read;
        ui_file_delete_ftype *to_delete;
        ui_file_isatty_ftype *to_isatty;
        ui_file_rewind_ftype *to_rewind;
        ui_file_put_ftype *to_put;
        void *to_data;
     }

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The completer can be confused by certain kinds of invalid
expressions.  Also, it only examines the static type of the expression,
not the dynamic type.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Help,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Commands

3.3 Getting Help
================

You can always ask GDB itself for information on its commands, using the
command 'help'.

'help'
'h'
     You can use 'help' (abbreviated 'h') with no arguments to display a
     short list of named classes of commands:

          (gdb) help
          List of classes of commands:

          aliases -- Aliases of other commands
          breakpoints -- Making program stop at certain points
          data -- Examining data
          files -- Specifying and examining files
          internals -- Maintenance commands
          obscure -- Obscure features
          running -- Running the program
          stack -- Examining the stack
          status -- Status inquiries
          support -- Support facilities
          tracepoints -- Tracing of program execution without
                         stopping the program
          user-defined -- User-defined commands

          Type "help" followed by a class name for a list of
          commands in that class.
          Type "help" followed by command name for full
          documentation.
          Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
          (gdb)

'help CLASS'
     Using one of the general help classes as an argument, you can get a
     list of the individual commands in that class.  For example, here
     is the help display for the class 'status':

          (gdb) help status
          Status inquiries.

          List of commands:

          info -- Generic command for showing things
                  about the program being debugged
          show -- Generic command for showing things
                  about the debugger

          Type "help" followed by command name for full
          documentation.
          Command name abbreviations are allowed if unambiguous.
          (gdb)

'help COMMAND'
     With a command name as 'help' argument, GDB displays a short
     paragraph on how to use that command.

'apropos ARGS'
     The 'apropos' command searches through all of the GDB commands, and
     their documentation, for the regular expression specified in ARGS.
     It prints out all matches found.  For example:

          apropos alias

     results in:

          alias -- Define a new command that is an alias of an existing command
          aliases -- Aliases of other commands
          d -- Delete some breakpoints or auto-display expressions
          del -- Delete some breakpoints or auto-display expressions
          delete -- Delete some breakpoints or auto-display expressions

'complete ARGS'
     The 'complete ARGS' command lists all the possible completions for
     the beginning of a command.  Use ARGS to specify the beginning of
     the command you want completed.  For example:

          complete i

     results in:

          if
          ignore
          info
          inspect

     This is intended for use by GNU Emacs.

   In addition to 'help', you can use the GDB commands 'info' and 'show'
to inquire about the state of your program, or the state of GDB itself.
Each command supports many topics of inquiry; this manual introduces
each of them in the appropriate context.  The listings under 'info' and
under 'show' in the Command, Variable, and Function Index point to all
the sub-commands.  *Note Command and Variable Index::.

'info'
     This command (abbreviated 'i') is for describing the state of your
     program.  For example, you can show the arguments passed to a
     function with 'info args', list the registers currently in use with
     'info registers', or list the breakpoints you have set with 'info
     breakpoints'.  You can get a complete list of the 'info'
     sub-commands with 'help info'.

'set'
     You can assign the result of an expression to an environment
     variable with 'set'.  For example, you can set the GDB prompt to a
     $-sign with 'set prompt $'.

'show'
     In contrast to 'info', 'show' is for describing the state of GDB
     itself.  You can change most of the things you can 'show', by using
     the related command 'set'; for example, you can control what number
     system is used for displays with 'set radix', or simply inquire
     which is currently in use with 'show radix'.

     To display all the settable parameters and their current values,
     you can use 'show' with no arguments; you may also use 'info set'.
     Both commands produce the same display.

   Here are several miscellaneous 'show' subcommands, all of which are
exceptional in lacking corresponding 'set' commands:

'show version'
     Show what version of GDB is running.  You should include this
     information in GDB bug-reports.  If multiple versions of GDB are in
     use at your site, you may need to determine which version of GDB
     you are running; as GDB evolves, new commands are introduced, and
     old ones may wither away.  Also, many system vendors ship variant
     versions of GDB, and there are variant versions of GDB in GNU/Linux
     distributions as well.  The version number is the same as the one
     announced when you start GDB.

'show copying'
'info copying'
     Display information about permission for copying GDB.

'show warranty'
'info warranty'
     Display the GNU "NO WARRANTY" statement, or a warranty, if your
     version of GDB comes with one.

'show configuration'
     Display detailed information about the way GDB was configured when
     it was built.  This displays the optional arguments passed to the

     automatically by 'configure'.  When reporting a GDB bug (*note GDB

4 Running Programs Under GDB
****************************

When you run a program under GDB, you must first generate debugging
information when you compile it.

   You may start GDB with its arguments, if any, in an environment of
your choice.  If you are doing native debugging, you may redirect your
program's input and output, debug an already running process, or kill a
child process.

4.1 Compiling for Debugging
===========================

In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate debugging
information when you compile it.  This debugging information is stored
in the object file; it describes the data type of each variable or
function and the correspondence between source line numbers and
addresses in the executable code.

   To request debugging information, specify the '-g' option when you
run the compiler.

   Programs that are to be shipped to your customers are compiled with
optimizations, using the '-O' compiler option.  However, some compilers
are unable to handle the '-g' and '-O' options together.  Using those
compilers, you cannot generate optimized executables containing
debugging information.

   GCC, the GNU C/C++ compiler, supports '-g' with or without '-O',
making it possible to debug optimized code.  We recommend that you
_always_ use '-g' whenever you compile a program.  You may think your
program is correct, but there is no sense in pushing your luck.  For
more information, see *note Optimized Code::.

   Older versions of the GNU C compiler permitted a variant option '-gg'
for debugging information.  GDB no longer supports this format; if your
GNU C compiler has this option, do not use it.

   GDB knows about preprocessor macros and can show you their expansion
(*note Macros::).  Most compilers do not include information about
preprocessor macros in the debugging information if you specify the '-g'
flag alone.  Version 3.1 and later of GCC, the GNU C compiler, provides
macro information if you are using the DWARF debugging format, and
specify the option '-g3'.

   *Note Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC: (gcc.info)Debugging
Options, for more information on GCC options affecting debug
information.

   You will have the best debugging experience if you use the latest
version of the DWARF debugging format that your compiler supports.
DWARF is currently the most expressive and best supported debugging
format in GDB.

4.2 Starting your Program
=========================

'run'
'r'
     Use the 'run' command to start your program under GDB.  You must
     first specify the program name (except on VxWorks) with an argument
     to GDB (*note Getting In and Out of GDB: Invocation.), or by using
     the 'file' or 'exec-file' command (*note Commands to Specify Files:
     Files.).

   If you are running your program in an execution environment that
supports processes, 'run' creates an inferior process and makes that
process run your program.  In some environments without processes, 'run'
jumps to the start of your program.  Other targets, like 'remote', are
always running.  If you get an error message like this one:

     The "remote" target does not support "run".
     Try "help target" or "continue".

then use 'continue' to run your program.  You may need 'load' first
(*note load::).

   The execution of a program is affected by certain information it
receives from its superior.  GDB provides ways to specify this
information, which you must do _before_ starting your program.  (You can
change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect your
program the next time you start it.)  This information may be divided
into four categories:

The _arguments._
     Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the
     'run' command.  If a shell is available on your target, the shell
     is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal
     conventions (such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution)
     in describing the arguments.  In Unix systems, you can control
     which shell is used with the 'SHELL' environment variable.  If you
     do not define 'SHELL', GDB uses the default shell ('/bin/sh').  You
     can disable use of any shell with the 'set startup-with-shell'
     command (see below for details).

The _environment._
     Your program normally inherits its environment from GDB, but you
     can use the GDB commands 'set environment' and 'unset environment'
     to change parts of the environment that affect your program.  *Note
     Your Program's Environment: Environment.

The _working directory._
     Your program inherits its working directory from GDB.  You can set
     the GDB working directory with the 'cd' command in GDB.  *Note Your
     Program's Working Directory: Working Directory.

The _standard input and output._
     Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and
     standard output as GDB is using.  You can redirect input and output
     in the 'run' command line, or you can use the 'tty' command to set
     a different device for your program.  *Note Your Program's Input
     and Output: Input/Output.

     _Warning:_ While input and output redirection work, you cannot use
     pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to
     another program; if you attempt this, GDB is likely to wind up
     debugging the wrong program.

   When you issue the 'run' command, your program begins to execute
immediately.  *Note Stopping and Continuing: Stopping, for discussion of
how to arrange for your program to stop.  Once your program has stopped,
you may call functions in your program, using the 'print' or 'call'
commands.  *Note Examining Data: Data.

   If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the
last time GDB read its symbols, GDB discards its symbol table, and reads
it again.  When it does this, GDB tries to retain your current
breakpoints.

'start'
     The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language.
     With C or C++, the main procedure name is always 'main', but other
     languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their main
     procedure.  The debugger provides a convenient way to start the
     execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main
     procedure, depending on the language used.

     The 'start' command does the equivalent of setting a temporary
     breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking
     the 'run' command.

     Some programs contain an "elaboration" phase where some startup
     code is executed before the main procedure is called.  This depends
     on the languages used to write your program.  In C++, for instance,
     constructors for static and global objects are executed before
     'main' is called.  It is therefore possible that the debugger stops
     before reaching the main procedure.  However, the temporary
     breakpoint will remain to halt execution.

     Specify the arguments to give to your program as arguments to the
     'start' command.  These arguments will be given verbatim to the
     underlying 'run' command.  Note that the same arguments will be
     reused if no argument is provided during subsequent calls to
     'start' or 'run'.

     It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration.
     In these cases, using the 'start' command would stop the execution
     of your program too late, as the program would have already
     completed the elaboration phase.  Under these circumstances, insert
     breakpoints in your elaboration code before running your program.

'set exec-wrapper WRAPPER'
'show exec-wrapper'
'unset exec-wrapper'
     When 'exec-wrapper' is set, the specified wrapper is used to launch
     programs for debugging.  GDB starts your program with a shell
     command of the form 'exec WRAPPER PROGRAM'.  Quoting is added to
     PROGRAM and its arguments, but not to WRAPPER, so you should add
     quotes if appropriate for your shell.  The wrapper runs until it
     executes your program, and then GDB takes control.

     You can use any program that eventually calls 'execve' with its
     arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do this,
     e.g. 'env' and 'nohup'.  Any Unix shell script ending with 'exec
     "$@"' will also work.

     For example, you can use 'env' to pass an environment variable to
     the debugged program, without setting the variable in your shell's
     environment:

          (gdb) set exec-wrapper env 'LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so'
          (gdb) run

     This command is available when debugging locally on most targets,
     excluding DJGPP, Cygwin, MS Windows, and QNX Neutrino.

'set startup-with-shell'
'set startup-with-shell on'
'set startup-with-shell off'
'show set startup-with-shell'
     On Unix systems, by default, if a shell is available on your
     target, GDB) uses it to start your program.  Arguments of the 'run'
     command are passed to the shell, which does variable substitution,
     expands wildcard characters and performs redirection of I/O. In
     some circumstances, it may be useful to disable such use of a
     shell, for example, when debugging the shell itself or diagnosing
     startup failures such as:

          (gdb) run
          Starting program: ./a.out
          During startup program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

     which indicates the shell or the wrapper specified with
     'exec-wrapper' crashed, not your program.  Most often, this is
     caused by something odd in your shell's non-interactive mode
     initialization file--such as '.cshrc' for C-shell, $'.zshenv' for
     the Z shell, or the file specified in the 'BASH_ENV' environment
     variable for BASH.

'set auto-connect-native-target'
'set auto-connect-native-target on'
'set auto-connect-native-target off'
'show auto-connect-native-target'

     By default, if not connected to any target yet (e.g., with 'target
     remote'), the 'run' command starts your program as a native process
     under GDB, on your local machine.  If you're sure you don't want to
     debug programs on your local machine, you can tell GDB to not
     connect to the native target automatically with the 'set
     auto-connect-native-target off' command.

     If 'on', which is the default, and if GDB is not connected to a
     target already, the 'run' command automaticaly connects to the
     native target, if one is available.

     If 'off', and if GDB is not connected to a target already, the
     'run' command fails with an error:

          (gdb) run
          Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".

     If GDB is already connected to a target, GDB always uses it with
     the 'run' command.

     In any case, you can explicitly connect to the native target with
     the 'target native' command.  For example,

          (gdb) set auto-connect-native-target off
          (gdb) run
          Don't know how to run.  Try "help target".
          (gdb) target native
          (gdb) run
          Starting program: ./a.out
          [Inferior 1 (process 10421) exited normally]

     In case you connected explicitly to the 'native' target, GDB
     remains connected even if all inferiors exit, ready for the next
     'run' command.  Use the 'disconnect' command to disconnect.

     Examples of other commands that likewise respect the
     'auto-connect-native-target' setting: 'attach', 'info proc', 'info
     os'.

'set disable-randomization'
'set disable-randomization on'
     This option (enabled by default in GDB) will turn off the native
     randomization of the virtual address space of the started program.
     This option is useful for multiple debugging sessions to make the
     execution better reproducible and memory addresses reusable across
     debugging sessions.

     This feature is implemented only on certain targets, including
     GNU/Linux.  On GNU/Linux you can get the same behavior using

          (gdb) set exec-wrapper setarch `uname -m` -R

'set disable-randomization off'
     Leave the behavior of the started executable unchanged.  Some bugs
     rear their ugly heads only when the program is loaded at certain
     addresses.  If your bug disappears when you run the program under
     GDB, that might be because GDB by default disables the address
     randomization on platforms, such as GNU/Linux, which do that for
     stand-alone programs.  Use 'set disable-randomization off' to try
     to reproduce such elusive bugs.

     On targets where it is available, virtual address space
     randomization protects the programs against certain kinds of
     security attacks.  In these cases the attacker needs to know the
     exact location of a concrete executable code.  Randomizing its
     location makes it impossible to inject jumps misusing a code at its
     expected addresses.

     Prelinking shared libraries provides a startup performance
     advantage but it makes addresses in these libraries predictable for
     privileged processes by having just unprivileged access at the
     target system.  Reading the shared library binary gives enough
     information for assembling the malicious code misusing it.  Still
     even a prelinked shared library can get loaded at a new random
     address just requiring the regular relocation process during the
     startup.  Shared libraries not already prelinked are always loaded
     at a randomly chosen address.

     Position independent executables (PIE) contain position independent
     code similar to the shared libraries and therefore such executables
     get loaded at a randomly chosen address upon startup.  PIE
     executables always load even already prelinked shared libraries at
     a random address.  You can build such executable using 'gcc -fPIE
     -pie'.

     Heap (malloc storage), stack and custom mmap areas are always
     placed randomly (as long as the randomization is enabled).

'show disable-randomization'
     Show the current setting of the explicit disable of the native
     randomization of the virtual address space of the started program.

4.3 Your Program's Arguments
============================

The arguments to your program can be specified by the arguments of the
'run' command.  They are passed to a shell, which expands wildcard
characters and performs redirection of I/O, and thence to your program.
Your 'SHELL' environment variable (if it exists) specifies what shell
GDB uses.  If you do not define 'SHELL', GDB uses the default shell
('/bin/sh' on Unix).

   On non-Unix systems, the program is usually invoked directly by GDB,
which emulates I/O redirection via the appropriate system calls, and the
wildcard characters are expanded by the startup code of the program, not
by the shell.

   'run' with no arguments uses the same arguments used by the previous
'run', or those set by the 'set args' command.

'set args'
     Specify the arguments to be used the next time your program is run.
     If 'set args' has no arguments, 'run' executes your program with no
     arguments.  Once you have run your program with arguments, using
     'set args' before the next 'run' is the only way to run it again
     without arguments.

'show args'
     Show the arguments to give your program when it is started.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Environment,  Next: Working Directory,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Running

4.4 Your Program's Environment
==============================

The "environment" consists of a set of environment variables and their
values.  Environment variables conventionally record such things as your
user name, your home directory, your terminal type, and your search path
for programs to run.  Usually you set up environment variables with the
shell and they are inherited by all the other programs you run.  When
debugging, it can be useful to try running your program with a modified
environment without having to start GDB over again.

'path DIRECTORY'
     Add DIRECTORY to the front of the 'PATH' environment variable (the
     search path for executables) that will be passed to your program.
     The value of 'PATH' used by GDB does not change.  You may specify
     several directory names, separated by whitespace or by a
     system-dependent separator character (':' on Unix, ';' on MS-DOS
     and MS-Windows).  If DIRECTORY is already in the path, it is moved
     to the front, so it is searched sooner.

     You can use the string '$cwd' to refer to whatever is the current
     working directory at the time GDB searches the path.  If you use
     '.' instead, it refers to the directory where you executed the
     'path' command.  GDB replaces '.' in the DIRECTORY argument (with
     the current path) before adding DIRECTORY to the search path.

'show paths'
     Display the list of search paths for executables (the 'PATH'
     environment variable).

'show environment [VARNAME]'
     Print the value of environment variable VARNAME to be given to your
     program when it starts.  If you do not supply VARNAME, print the
     names and values of all environment variables to be given to your
     program.  You can abbreviate 'environment' as 'env'.

'set environment VARNAME [=VALUE]'
     Set environment variable VARNAME to VALUE.  The value changes for
     your program (and the shell GDB uses to launch it), not for GDB
     itself.  The VALUE may be any string; the values of environment
     variables are just strings, and any interpretation is supplied by
     your program itself.  The VALUE parameter is optional; if it is
     eliminated, the variable is set to a null value.

     For example, this command:

          set env USER = foo

     tells the debugged program, when subsequently run, that its user is
     named 'foo'.  (The spaces around '=' are used for clarity here;
     they are not actually required.)

     Note that on Unix systems, GDB runs your program via a shell, which
     also inherits the environment set with 'set environment'.  If
     necessary, you can avoid that by using the 'env' program as a
     wrapper instead of using 'set environment'.  *Note set
     exec-wrapper::, for an example doing just that.

'unset environment VARNAME'
     Remove variable VARNAME from the environment to be passed to your
     program.  This is different from 'set env VARNAME ='; 'unset
     environment' removes the variable from the environment, rather than
     assigning it an empty value.

   _Warning:_ On Unix systems, GDB runs your program using the shell
indicated by your 'SHELL' environment variable if it exists (or
'/bin/sh' if not).  If your 'SHELL' variable names a shell that runs an
initialization file when started non-interactively--such as '.cshrc' for
C-shell, $'.zshenv' for the Z shell, or the file specified in the
'BASH_ENV' environment variable for BASH--any variables you set in that
file affect your program.  You may wish to move setting of environment
variables to files that are only run when you sign on, such as '.login'
or '.profile'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Working Directory,  Next: Input/Output,  Prev: Environment,  Up: Running

4.5 Your Program's Working Directory
====================================

Each time you start your program with 'run', it inherits its working
directory from the current working directory of GDB.  The GDB working
directory is initially whatever it inherited from its parent process
(typically the shell), but you can specify a new working directory in
GDB with the 'cd' command.

   The GDB working directory also serves as a default for the commands
that specify files for GDB to operate on.  *Note Commands to Specify
Files: Files.

'cd [DIRECTORY]'
     Set the GDB working directory to DIRECTORY.  If not given,
     DIRECTORY uses ''~''.

'pwd'
     Print the GDB working directory.

   It is generally impossible to find the current working directory of
the process being debugged (since a program can change its directory
during its run).  If you work on a system where GDB is configured with
the '/proc' support, you can use the 'info proc' command (*note SVR4
Process Information::) to find out the current working directory of the
debuggee.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Input/Output,  Next: Attach,  Prev: Working Directory,  Up: Running

4.6 Your Program's Input and Output
===================================

By default, the program you run under GDB does input and output to the
same terminal that GDB uses.  GDB switches the terminal to its own
terminal modes to interact with you, but it records the terminal modes
your program was using and switches back to them when you continue
running your program.

'info terminal'
     Displays information recorded by GDB about the terminal modes your
     program is using.

   You can redirect your program's input and/or output using shell
redirection with the 'run' command.  For example,

     run > outfile

starts your program, diverting its output to the file 'outfile'.

   Another way to specify where your program should do input and output
is with the 'tty' command.  This command accepts a file name as
argument, and causes this file to be the default for future 'run'
commands.  It also resets the controlling terminal for the child
process, for future 'run' commands.  For example,

     tty /dev/ttyb

directs that processes started with subsequent 'run' commands default to
do input and output on the terminal '/dev/ttyb' and have that as their
controlling terminal.

   An explicit redirection in 'run' overrides the 'tty' command's effect
on the input/output device, but not its effect on the controlling
terminal.

   When you use the 'tty' command or redirect input in the 'run'
command, only the input _for your program_ is affected.  The input for
GDB still comes from your terminal.  'tty' is an alias for 'set
inferior-tty'.

   You can use the 'show inferior-tty' command to tell GDB to display
the name of the terminal that will be used for future runs of your
program.

'set inferior-tty /dev/ttyb'
     Set the tty for the program being debugged to /dev/ttyb.

'show inferior-tty'
     Show the current tty for the program being debugged.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Attach,  Next: Kill Process,  Prev: Input/Output,  Up: Running

4.7 Debugging an Already-running Process
========================================

'attach PROCESS-ID'
     This command attaches to a running process--one that was started
     outside GDB.  ('info files' shows your active targets.)  The
     command takes as argument a process ID. The usual way to find out
     the PROCESS-ID of a Unix process is with the 'ps' utility, or with
     the 'jobs -l' shell command.

     'attach' does not repeat if you press <RET> a second time after
     executing the command.

   To use 'attach', your program must be running in an environment which
supports processes; for example, 'attach' does not work for programs on
bare-board targets that lack an operating system.  You must also have
permission to send the process a signal.

   When you use 'attach', the debugger finds the program running in the
process first by looking in the current working directory, then (if the
program is not found) by using the source file search path (*note
Specifying Source Directories: Source Path.).  You can also use the
'file' command to load the program.  *Note Commands to Specify Files:
Files.

   The first thing GDB does after arranging to debug the specified
process is to stop it.  You can examine and modify an attached process
with all the GDB commands that are ordinarily available when you start
processes with 'run'.  You can insert breakpoints; you can step and
continue; you can modify storage.  If you would rather the process
continue running, you may use the 'continue' command after attaching GDB
to the process.

'detach'
     When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use
     the 'detach' command to release it from GDB control.  Detaching the
     process continues its execution.  After the 'detach' command, that
     process and GDB become completely independent once more, and you
     are ready to 'attach' another process or start one with 'run'.
     'detach' does not repeat if you press <RET> again after executing
     the command.

   If you exit GDB while you have an attached process, you detach that
process.  If you use the 'run' command, you kill that process.  By
default, GDB asks for confirmation if you try to do either of these
things; you can control whether or not you need to confirm by using the
'set confirm' command (*note Optional Warnings and Messages:
Messages/Warnings.).


File: gdb.info,  Node: Kill Process,  Next: Inferiors and Programs,  Prev: Attach,  Up: Running

4.8 Killing the Child Process
=============================

'kill'
     Kill the child process in which your program is running under GDB.

   This command is useful if you wish to debug a core dump instead of a
running process.  GDB ignores any core dump file while your program is
running.

   On some operating systems, a program cannot be executed outside GDB
while you have breakpoints set on it inside GDB.  You can use the 'kill'
command in this situation to permit running your program outside the
debugger.

   The 'kill' command is also useful if you wish to recompile and relink
your program, since on many systems it is impossible to modify an
executable file while it is running in a process.  In this case, when
you next type 'run', GDB notices that the file has changed, and reads
the symbol table again (while trying to preserve your current breakpoint
settings).


File: gdb.info,  Node: Inferiors and Programs,  Next: Threads,  Prev: Kill Process,  Up: Running

4.9 Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs
=============================================

GDB lets you run and debug multiple programs in a single session.  In
addition, GDB on some systems may let you run several programs
simultaneously (otherwise you have to exit from one before starting
another).  In the most general case, you can have multiple threads of
execution in each of multiple processes, launched from multiple
executables.

   GDB represents the state of each program execution with an object
called an "inferior".  An inferior typically corresponds to a process,
but is more general and applies also to targets that do not have
processes.  Inferiors may be created before a process runs, and may be
retained after a process exits.  Inferiors have unique identifiers that
are different from process ids.  Usually each inferior will also have
its own distinct address space, although some embedded targets may have
several inferiors running in different parts of a single address space.
Each inferior may in turn have multiple threads running in it.

   To find out what inferiors exist at any moment, use 'info inferiors':

'info inferiors'
     Print a list of all inferiors currently being managed by GDB.

     GDB displays for each inferior (in this order):

       1. the inferior number assigned by GDB

       2. the target system's inferior identifier

       3. the name of the executable the inferior is running.

     An asterisk '*' preceding the GDB inferior number indicates the
     current inferior.

     For example,

     (gdb) info inferiors
       Num  Description       Executable
       2    process 2307      hello
     * 1    process 3401      goodbye

   To switch focus between inferiors, use the 'inferior' command:

'inferior INFNO'
     Make inferior number INFNO the current inferior.  The argument
     INFNO is the inferior number assigned by GDB, as shown in the first
     field of the 'info inferiors' display.

   You can get multiple executables into a debugging session via the
'add-inferior' and 'clone-inferior' commands.  On some systems GDB can
add inferiors to the debug session automatically by following calls to
'fork' and 'exec'.  To remove inferiors from the debugging session use
the 'remove-inferiors' command.

'add-inferior [ -copies N ] [ -exec EXECUTABLE ]'
     Adds N inferiors to be run using EXECUTABLE as the executable; N
     defaults to 1.  If no executable is specified, the inferiors begins
     empty, with no program.  You can still assign or change the program
     assigned to the inferior at any time by using the 'file' command
     with the executable name as its argument.

'clone-inferior [ -copies N ] [ INFNO ]'
     Adds N inferiors ready to execute the same program as inferior
     INFNO; N defaults to 1, and INFNO defaults to the number of the
     current inferior.  This is a convenient command when you want to
     run another instance of the inferior you are debugging.

          (gdb) info inferiors
            Num  Description       Executable
          * 1    process 29964     helloworld
          (gdb) clone-inferior
          Added inferior 2.
          1 inferiors added.
          (gdb) info inferiors
            Num  Description       Executable
            2    <null>            helloworld
          * 1    process 29964     helloworld

     You can now simply switch focus to inferior 2 and run it.

'remove-inferiors INFNO...'
     Removes the inferior or inferiors INFNO....  It is not possible to
     remove an inferior that is running with this command.  For those,
     use the 'kill' or 'detach' command first.

   To quit debugging one of the running inferiors that is not the
current inferior, you can either detach from it by using the 'detach inferior'
command (allowing it to run independently), or kill it using the 'kill inferiors'
command:

'detach inferior INFNO...'
     Detach from the inferior or inferiors identified by GDB inferior
     number(s) INFNO....  Note that the inferior's entry still stays on
     the list of inferiors shown by 'info inferiors', but its
     Description will show '<null>'.

'kill inferiors INFNO...'
     Kill the inferior or inferiors identified by GDB inferior number(s)
     INFNO....  Note that the inferior's entry still stays on the list
     of inferiors shown by 'info inferiors', but its Description will
     show '<null>'.

   After the successful completion of a command such as 'detach',
'detach inferiors', 'kill' or 'kill inferiors', or after a normal
process exit, the inferior is still valid and listed with 'info
inferiors', ready to be restarted.

   To be notified when inferiors are started or exit under GDB's control
use 'set print inferior-events':

'set print inferior-events'
'set print inferior-events on'
'set print inferior-events off'
     The 'set print inferior-events' command allows you to enable or
     disable printing of messages when GDB notices that new inferiors
     have started or that inferiors have exited or have been detached.
     By default, these messages will not be printed.

'show print inferior-events'
     Show whether messages will be printed when GDB detects that
     inferiors have started, exited or have been detached.

   Many commands will work the same with multiple programs as with a
single program: e.g., 'print myglobal' will simply display the value of
'myglobal' in the current inferior.

   Occasionaly, when debugging GDB itself, it may be useful to get more
info about the relationship of inferiors, programs, address spaces in a
debug session.  You can do that with the 'maint info program-spaces'
command.

'maint info program-spaces'
     Print a list of all program spaces currently being managed by GDB.

     GDB displays for each program space (in this order):

       1. the program space number assigned by GDB

       2. the name of the executable loaded into the program space, with
          e.g., the 'file' command.

     An asterisk '*' preceding the GDB program space number indicates
     the current program space.

     In addition, below each program space line, GDB prints extra
     information that isn't suitable to display in tabular form.  For
     example, the list of inferiors bound to the program space.

          (gdb) maint info program-spaces
            Id   Executable
            2    goodbye
                  Bound inferiors: ID 1 (process 21561)
          * 1    hello

     Here we can see that no inferior is running the program 'hello',
     while 'process 21561' is running the program 'goodbye'.  On some
     targets, it is possible that multiple inferiors are bound to the
     same program space.  The most common example is that of debugging
     both the parent and child processes of a 'vfork' call.  For
     example,

          (gdb) maint info program-spaces
            Id   Executable
          * 1    vfork-test
                  Bound inferiors: ID 2 (process 18050), ID 1 (process 18045)

     Here, both inferior 2 and inferior 1 are running in the same
     program space as a result of inferior 1 having executed a 'vfork'
     call.

4.10 Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads
=============================================

In some operating systems, such as HP-UX and Solaris, a single program
may have more than one "thread" of execution.  The precise semantics of
threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general the
threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes--except that
they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and modify
the same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own
registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.

   GDB provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread programs:

   * automatic notification of new threads
   * 'thread THREADNO', a command to switch among threads
   * 'info threads', a command to inquire about existing threads
   * 'thread apply [THREADNO] [ALL] ARGS', a command to apply a command
     to a list of threads
   * thread-specific breakpoints
   * 'set print thread-events', which controls printing of messages on
     thread start and exit.
   * 'set libthread-db-search-path PATH', which lets the user specify
     which 'libthread_db' to use if the default choice isn't compatible
     with the program.

     _Warning:_ These facilities are not yet available on every GDB
     configuration where the operating system supports threads.  If your
     GDB does not support threads, these commands have no effect.  For
     example, a system without thread support shows no output from 'info
     threads', and always rejects the 'thread' command, like this:

          (gdb) info threads
          (gdb) thread 1
          Thread ID 1 not known.  Use the "info threads" command to
          see the IDs of currently known threads.

   The GDB thread debugging facility allows you to observe all threads
while your program runs--but whenever GDB takes control, one thread in
particular is always the focus of debugging.  This thread is called the
"current thread".  Debugging commands show program information from the
perspective of the current thread.

   Whenever GDB detects a new thread in your program, it displays the
target system's identification for the thread with a message in the form
'[New SYSTAG]', where SYSTAG is a thread identifier whose form varies
depending on the particular system.  For example, on GNU/Linux, you
might see

     [New Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 25582)]

when GDB notices a new thread.  In contrast, on an SGI system, the
SYSTAG is simply something like 'process 368', with no further
qualifier.

   For debugging purposes, GDB associates its own thread number--always
a single integer--with each thread in your program.

'info threads [ID...]'
     Display a summary of all threads currently in your program.
     Optional argument ID... is one or more thread ids separated by
     spaces, and means to print information only about the specified
     thread or threads.  GDB displays for each thread (in this order):

       1. the thread number assigned by GDB

       2. the target system's thread identifier (SYSTAG)

       3. the thread's name, if one is known.  A thread can either be
          named by the user (see 'thread name', below), or, in some
          cases, by the program itself.

       4. the current stack frame summary for that thread

     An asterisk '*' to the left of the GDB thread number indicates the
     current thread.

     For example,

     (gdb) info threads
       Id   Target Id         Frame
       3    process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
       2    process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
     * 1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
         at threadtest.c:68

   On Solaris, you can display more information about user threads with
a Solaris-specific command:

'maint info sol-threads'
     Display info on Solaris user threads.

'thread THREADNO'
     Make thread number THREADNO the current thread.  The command
     argument THREADNO is the internal GDB thread number, as shown in
     the first field of the 'info threads' display.  GDB responds by
     displaying the system identifier of the thread you selected, and
     its current stack frame summary:

          (gdb) thread 2
          [Switching to thread 2 (Thread 0xb7fdab70 (LWP 12747))]
          #0  some_function (ignore=0x0) at example.c:8
          8	    printf ("hello\n");

     As with the '[New ...]' message, the form of the text after
     'Switching to' depends on your system's conventions for identifying
     threads.

     The debugger convenience variable '$_thread' contains the number of
     the current thread.  You may find this useful in writing breakpoint
     conditional expressions, command scripts, and so forth.  See *Note
     Convenience Variables: Convenience Vars, for general information on
     convenience variables.

'thread apply [THREADNO | all] COMMAND'
     The 'thread apply' command allows you to apply the named COMMAND to
     one or more threads.  Specify the numbers of the threads that you
     want affected with the command argument THREADNO.  It can be a
     single thread number, one of the numbers shown in the first field
     of the 'info threads' display; or it could be a range of thread
     numbers, as in '2-4'.  To apply a command to all threads, type
     'thread apply all COMMAND'.

'thread name [NAME]'
     This command assigns a name to the current thread.  If no argument
     is given, any existing user-specified name is removed.  The thread
     name appears in the 'info threads' display.

     On some systems, such as GNU/Linux, GDB is able to determine the
     name of the thread as given by the OS. On these systems, a name
     specified with 'thread name' will override the system-give name,
     and removing the user-specified name will cause GDB to once again
     display the system-specified name.

'thread find [REGEXP]'
     Search for and display thread ids whose name or SYSTAG matches the
     supplied regular expression.

     As well as being the complement to the 'thread name' command, this
     command also allows you to identify a thread by its target SYSTAG.
     For instance, on GNU/Linux, the target SYSTAG is the LWP id.

          (GDB) thread find 26688
          Thread 4 has target id 'Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 26688)'
          (GDB) info thread 4
            Id   Target Id         Frame
            4    Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 26688) 0x00000031ca6cd372 in select ()

'set print thread-events'
'set print thread-events on'
'set print thread-events off'
     The 'set print thread-events' command allows you to enable or
     disable printing of messages when GDB notices that new threads have
     started or that threads have exited.  By default, these messages
     will be printed if detection of these events is supported by the
     target.  Note that these messages cannot be disabled on all
     targets.

'show print thread-events'
     Show whether messages will be printed when GDB detects that threads
     have started and exited.

   *Note Stopping and Starting Multi-thread Programs: Thread Stops, for
more information about how GDB behaves when you stop and start programs
with multiple threads.

   *Note Setting Watchpoints: Set Watchpoints, for information about
watchpoints in programs with multiple threads.

'set libthread-db-search-path [PATH]'
     If this variable is set, PATH is a colon-separated list of
     directories GDB will use to search for 'libthread_db'.  If you omit
     PATH, 'libthread-db-search-path' will be reset to its default value
     ('$sdir:$pdir' on GNU/Linux and Solaris systems).  Internally, the
     default value comes from the 'LIBTHREAD_DB_SEARCH_PATH' macro.

     On GNU/Linux and Solaris systems, GDB uses a "helper"
     'libthread_db' library to obtain information about threads in the
     inferior process.  GDB will use 'libthread-db-search-path' to find
     'libthread_db'.  GDB also consults first if inferior specific
     thread debugging library loading is enabled by 'set auto-load
     libthread-db' (*note libthread_db.so.1 file::).

     A special entry '$sdir' for 'libthread-db-search-path' refers to
     the default system directories that are normally searched for
     loading shared libraries.  The '$sdir' entry is the only kind not
     needing to be enabled by 'set auto-load libthread-db' (*note
     libthread_db.so.1 file::).

     A special entry '$pdir' for 'libthread-db-search-path' refers to
     the directory from which 'libpthread' was loaded in the inferior
     process.

     For any 'libthread_db' library GDB finds in above directories, GDB
     attempts to initialize it with the current inferior process.  If
     this initialization fails (which could happen because of a version
     mismatch between 'libthread_db' and 'libpthread'), GDB will unload
     'libthread_db', and continue with the next directory.  If none of
     'libthread_db' libraries initialize successfully, GDB will issue a
     warning and thread debugging will be disabled.

     Setting 'libthread-db-search-path' is currently implemented only on
     some platforms.

'show libthread-db-search-path'
     Display current libthread_db search path.

'set debug libthread-db'
'show debug libthread-db'
     Turns on or off display of 'libthread_db'-related events.  Use '1'
     to enable, '0' to disable.

4.11 Debugging Forks
====================

On most systems, GDB has no special support for debugging programs which
create additional processes using the 'fork' function.  When a program
forks, GDB will continue to debug the parent process and the child
process will run unimpeded.  If you have set a breakpoint in any code
which the child then executes, the child will get a 'SIGTRAP' signal
which (unless it catches the signal) will cause it to terminate.

   However, if you want to debug the child process there is a workaround
which isn't too painful.  Put a call to 'sleep' in the code which the
child process executes after the fork.  It may be useful to sleep only
if a certain environment variable is set, or a certain file exists, so
that the delay need not occur when you don't want to run GDB on the
child.  While the child is sleeping, use the 'ps' program to get its
process ID. Then tell GDB (a new invocation of GDB if you are also
debugging the parent process) to attach to the child process (*note
Attach::).  From that point on you can debug the child process just like
any other process which you attached to.

   On some systems, GDB provides support for debugging programs that
create additional processes using the 'fork' or 'vfork' functions.
Currently, the only platforms with this feature are HP-UX (11.x and
later only?)  and GNU/Linux (kernel version 2.5.60 and later).

   By default, when a program forks, GDB will continue to debug the
parent process and the child process will run unimpeded.

   If you want to follow the child process instead of the parent
process, use the command 'set follow-fork-mode'.

'set follow-fork-mode MODE'
     Set the debugger response to a program call of 'fork' or 'vfork'.
     A call to 'fork' or 'vfork' creates a new process.  The MODE
     argument can be:

     'parent'
          The original process is debugged after a fork.  The child
          process runs unimpeded.  This is the default.

     'child'
          The new process is debugged after a fork.  The parent process
          runs unimpeded.

'show follow-fork-mode'
     Display the current debugger response to a 'fork' or 'vfork' call.

   On Linux, if you want to debug both the parent and child processes,
use the command 'set detach-on-fork'.

'set detach-on-fork MODE'
     Tells gdb whether to detach one of the processes after a fork, or
     retain debugger control over them both.

     'on'
          The child process (or parent process, depending on the value
          of 'follow-fork-mode') will be detached and allowed to run
          independently.  This is the default.

     'off'
          Both processes will be held under the control of GDB.  One
          process (child or parent, depending on the value of
          'follow-fork-mode') is debugged as usual, while the other is
          held suspended.

'show detach-on-fork'
     Show whether detach-on-fork mode is on/off.

   If you choose to set 'detach-on-fork' mode off, then GDB will retain
control of all forked processes (including nested forks).  You can list
the forked processes under the control of GDB by using the 'info inferiors'
command, and switch from one fork to another by using the 'inferior'
command (*note Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs: Inferiors and
Programs.).

   To quit debugging one of the forked processes, you can either detach
from it by using the 'detach inferiors' command (allowing it to run
independently), or kill it using the 'kill inferiors' command.  *Note
Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs: Inferiors and Programs.

   If you ask to debug a child process and a 'vfork' is followed by an
'exec', GDB executes the new target up to the first breakpoint in the
new target.  If you have a breakpoint set on 'main' in your original
program, the breakpoint will also be set on the child process's 'main'.

   On some systems, when a child process is spawned by 'vfork', you
cannot debug the child or parent until an 'exec' call completes.

   If you issue a 'run' command to GDB after an 'exec' call executes,
the new target restarts.  To restart the parent process, use the 'file'
command with the parent executable name as its argument.  By default,
after an 'exec' call executes, GDB discards the symbols of the previous
executable image.  You can change this behaviour with the 'set follow-exec-mode'
command.

'set follow-exec-mode MODE'

     Set debugger response to a program call of 'exec'.  An 'exec' call
     replaces the program image of a process.

     'follow-exec-mode' can be:

     'new'
          GDB creates a new inferior and rebinds the process to this new
          inferior.  The program the process was running before the
          'exec' call can be restarted afterwards by restarting the
          original inferior.

          For example:

               (gdb) info inferiors
               (gdb) info inferior
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 1    <null>        prog1
               (gdb) run
               process 12020 is executing new program: prog2
               Program exited normally.
               (gdb) info inferiors
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 2    <null>        prog2
                 1    <null>        prog1

     'same'
          GDB keeps the process bound to the same inferior.  The new
          executable image replaces the previous executable loaded in
          the inferior.  Restarting the inferior after the 'exec' call,
          with e.g., the 'run' command, restarts the executable the
          process was running after the 'exec' call.  This is the
          default mode.

          For example:

               (gdb) info inferiors
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 1    <null>        prog1
               (gdb) run
               process 12020 is executing new program: prog2
               Program exited normally.
               (gdb) info inferiors
                 Id   Description   Executable
               * 1    <null>        prog2

   You can use the 'catch' command to make GDB stop whenever a 'fork',
'vfork', or 'exec' call is made.  *Note Setting Catchpoints: Set
Catchpoints.

4.12 Setting a _Bookmark_ to Return to Later
============================================

On certain operating systems(1), GDB is able to save a "snapshot" of a
program's state, called a "checkpoint", and come back to it later.

   Returning to a checkpoint effectively undoes everything that has
happened in the program since the 'checkpoint' was saved.  This includes
changes in memory, registers, and even (within some limits) system
state.  Effectively, it is like going back in time to the moment when
the checkpoint was saved.

   Thus, if you're stepping thru a program and you think you're getting
close to the point where things go wrong, you can save a checkpoint.
Then, if you accidentally go too far and miss the critical statement,
instead of having to restart your program from the beginning, you can
just go back to the checkpoint and start again from there.

   This can be especially useful if it takes a lot of time or steps to
reach the point where you think the bug occurs.

   To use the 'checkpoint'/'restart' method of debugging:

'checkpoint'
     Save a snapshot of the debugged program's current execution state.
     The 'checkpoint' command takes no arguments, but each checkpoint is
     assigned a small integer id, similar to a breakpoint id.

'info checkpoints'
     List the checkpoints that have been saved in the current debugging
     session.  For each checkpoint, the following information will be
     listed:

     'Checkpoint ID'
     'Process ID'
     'Code Address'
     'Source line, or label'

'restart CHECKPOINT-ID'
     Restore the program state that was saved as checkpoint number
     CHECKPOINT-ID.  All program variables, registers, stack frames etc.
     will be returned to the values that they had when the checkpoint
     was saved.  In essence, gdb will "wind back the clock" to the point
     in time when the checkpoint was saved.

     Note that breakpoints, GDB variables, command history etc.  are not
     affected by restoring a checkpoint.  In general, a checkpoint only
     restores things that reside in the program being debugged, not in
     the debugger.

'delete checkpoint CHECKPOINT-ID'
     Delete the previously-saved checkpoint identified by CHECKPOINT-ID.

   Returning to a previously saved checkpoint will restore the user
state of the program being debugged, plus a significant subset of the
system (OS) state, including file pointers.  It won't "un-write" data
from a file, but it will rewind the file pointer to the previous
location, so that the previously written data can be overwritten.  For
files opened in read mode, the pointer will also be restored so that the
previously read data can be read again.

   Of course, characters that have been sent to a printer (or other
external device) cannot be "snatched back", and characters received from
eg. a serial device can be removed from internal program buffers, but
they cannot be "pushed back" into the serial pipeline, ready to be
received again.  Similarly, the actual contents of files that have been
changed cannot be restored (at this time).

   However, within those constraints, you actually can "rewind" your
program to a previously saved point in time, and begin debugging it
again -- and you can change the course of events so as to debug a
different execution path this time.

   Finally, there is one bit of internal program state that will be
different when you return to a checkpoint -- the program's process id.
Each checkpoint will have a unique process id (or PID), and each will be
different from the program's original PID.  If your program has saved a
local copy of its process id, this could potentially pose a problem.

4.12.1 A Non-obvious Benefit of Using Checkpoints
-------------------------------------------------

On some systems such as GNU/Linux, address space randomization is
performed on new processes for security reasons.  This makes it
difficult or impossible to set a breakpoint, or watchpoint, on an
absolute address if you have to restart the program, since the absolute
location of a symbol will change from one execution to the next.

   A checkpoint, however, is an _identical_ copy of a process.
Therefore if you create a checkpoint at (eg.) the start of main, and
simply return to that checkpoint instead of restarting the process, you
can avoid the effects of address randomization and your symbols will all
stay in the same place.

5 Stopping and Continuing
*************************

The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your
program before it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into
trouble, you can investigate and find out why.

   Inside GDB, your program may stop for any of several reasons, such as
a signal, a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a GDB command such
as 'step'.  You may then examine and change variables, set new
breakpoints or remove old ones, and then continue execution.  Usually,
the messages shown by GDB provide ample explanation of the status of
your program--but you can also explicitly request this information at
any time.

'info program'

     running or not, what process it is, and why it stopped.

5.1 Breakpoints, Watchpoints, and Catchpoints
=============================================

A "breakpoint" makes your program stop whenever a certain point in the
program is reached.  For each breakpoint, you can add conditions to
control in finer detail whether your program stops.  You can set
breakpoints with the 'break' command and its variants (*note Setting
Breakpoints: Set Breaks.), to specify the place where your program
should stop by line number, function name or exact address in the
program.

   On some systems, you can set breakpoints in shared libraries before
the executable is run.  There is a minor limitation on HP-UX systems:
you must wait until the executable is run in order to set breakpoints in
shared library routines that are not called directly by the program (for
example, routines that are arguments in a 'pthread_create' call).

   A "watchpoint" is a special breakpoint that stops your program when
the value of an expression changes.  The expression may be a value of a
variable, or it could involve values of one or more variables combined
by operators, such as 'a + b'.  This is sometimes called "data
breakpoints".  You must use a different command to set watchpoints
(*note Setting Watchpoints: Set Watchpoints.), but aside from that, you
can manage a watchpoint like any other breakpoint: you enable, disable,
and delete both breakpoints and watchpoints using the same commands.

   You can arrange to have values from your program displayed
automatically whenever GDB stops at a breakpoint.  *Note Automatic
Display: Auto Display.

   A "catchpoint" is another special breakpoint that stops your program
when a certain kind of event occurs, such as the throwing of a C++
exception or the loading of a library.  As with watchpoints, you use a
different command to set a catchpoint (*note Setting Catchpoints: Set
Catchpoints.), but aside from that, you can manage a catchpoint like any
other breakpoint.  (To stop when your program receives a signal, use the
'handle' command; see *note Signals: Signals.)

   GDB assigns a number to each breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint
when you create it; these numbers are successive integers starting with
one.  In many of the commands for controlling various features of
breakpoints you use the breakpoint number to say which breakpoint you
want to change.  Each breakpoint may be "enabled" or "disabled"; if
disabled, it has no effect on your program until you enable it again.

   Some GDB commands accept a range of breakpoints on which to operate.
A breakpoint range is either a single breakpoint number, like '5', or
two such numbers, in increasing order, separated by a hyphen, like
'5-7'.  When a breakpoint range is given to a command, all breakpoints
in that range are operated on.

5.1.1 Setting Breakpoints
-------------------------

Breakpoints are set with the 'break' command (abbreviated 'b').  The
debugger convenience variable '$bpnum' records the number of the
breakpoint you've set most recently; see *note Convenience Variables:
Convenience Vars, for a discussion of what you can do with convenience
variables.

'break LOCATION'
     Set a breakpoint at the given LOCATION, which can specify a
     function name, a line number, or an address of an instruction.
     (*Note Specify Location::, for a list of all the possible ways to
     specify a LOCATION.)  The breakpoint will stop your program just
     before it executes any of the code in the specified LOCATION.

     When using source languages that permit overloading of symbols,
     such as C++, a function name may refer to more than one possible
     place to break.  *Note Ambiguous Expressions: Ambiguous
     Expressions, for a discussion of that situation.

     It is also possible to insert a breakpoint that will stop the
     program only if a specific thread (*note Thread-Specific
     Breakpoints::) or a specific task (*note Ada Tasks::) hits that
     breakpoint.

'break'
     When called without any arguments, 'break' sets a breakpoint at the
     next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame (*note
     Examining the Stack: Stack.).  In any selected frame but the
     innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control returns
     to that frame.  This is similar to the effect of a 'finish' command
     in the frame inside the selected frame--except that 'finish' does
     not leave an active breakpoint.  If you use 'break' without an
     argument in the innermost frame, GDB stops the next time it reaches
     the current location; this may be useful inside loops.

     GDB normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until
     at least one instruction has been executed.  If it did not do this,
     you would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first
     disabling the breakpoint.  This rule applies whether or not the
     breakpoint already existed when your program stopped.

'break ... if COND'
     Set a breakpoint with condition COND; evaluate the expression COND
     each time the breakpoint is reached, and stop only if the value is
     nonzero--that is, if COND evaluates as true.  '...' stands for one
     of the possible arguments described above (or no argument)
     specifying where to break.  *Note Break Conditions: Conditions, for
     more information on breakpoint conditions.

'tbreak ARGS'
     Set a breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  The ARGS are the same
     as for the 'break' command, and the breakpoint is set in the same
     way, but the breakpoint is automatically deleted after the first
     time your program stops there.  *Note Disabling Breakpoints:
     Disabling.

'hbreak ARGS'
     Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint.  The ARGS are the same as for
     the 'break' command and the breakpoint is set in the same way, but
     the breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware
     may not have this support.  The main purpose of this is EPROM/ROM
     code debugging, so you can set a breakpoint at an instruction
     without changing the instruction.  This can be used with the new
     trap-generation provided by SPARClite DSU and most x86-based
     targets.  These targets will generate traps when a program accesses
     some data or instruction address that is assigned to the debug
     registers.  However the hardware breakpoint registers can take a
     limited number of breakpoints.  For example, on the DSU, only two
     data breakpoints can be set at a time, and GDB will reject this
     command if more than two are used.  Delete or disable unused
     hardware breakpoints before setting new ones (*note Disabling
     Breakpoints: Disabling.).  *Note Break Conditions: Conditions.  For
     remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware breakpoints
     GDB will use, see *note set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit::.

'thbreak ARGS'
     Set a hardware-assisted breakpoint enabled only for one stop.  The
     ARGS are the same as for the 'hbreak' command and the breakpoint is
     set in the same way.  However, like the 'tbreak' command, the
     breakpoint is automatically deleted after the first time your
     program stops there.  Also, like the 'hbreak' command, the
     breakpoint requires hardware support and some target hardware may
     not have this support.  *Note Disabling Breakpoints: Disabling.
     See also *note Break Conditions: Conditions.

'rbreak REGEX'
     Set breakpoints on all functions matching the regular expression
     REGEX.  This command sets an unconditional breakpoint on all
     matches, printing a list of all breakpoints it set.  Once these
     breakpoints are set, they are treated just like the breakpoints set
     with the 'break' command.  You can delete them, disable them, or
     make them conditional the same way as any other breakpoint.

     The syntax of the regular expression is the standard one used with
     tools like 'grep'.  Note that this is different from the syntax
     used by shells, so for instance 'foo*' matches all functions that
     include an 'fo' followed by zero or more 'o's.  There is an
     implicit '.*' leading and trailing the regular expression you
     supply, so to match only functions that begin with 'foo', use
     '^foo'.

     When debugging C++ programs, 'rbreak' is useful for setting
     breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of any
     special classes.

     The 'rbreak' command can be used to set breakpoints in *all* the
     functions in a program, like this:

          (gdb) rbreak .

'rbreak FILE:REGEX'
     If 'rbreak' is called with a filename qualification, it limits the
     search for functions matching the given regular expression to the
     specified FILE.  This can be used, for example, to set breakpoints
     on every function in a given file:

          (gdb) rbreak file.c:.

     The colon separating the filename qualifier from the regex may
     optionally be surrounded by spaces.

'info breakpoints [N...]'
'info break [N...]'
     Print a table of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints set
     and not deleted.  Optional argument N means print information only
     about the specified breakpoint(s) (or watchpoint(s) or
     catchpoint(s)).  For each breakpoint, following columns are
     printed:

     _Breakpoint Numbers_
     _Type_
          Breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint.
     _Disposition_
          Whether the breakpoint is marked to be disabled or deleted
          when hit.
     _Enabled or Disabled_
          Enabled breakpoints are marked with 'y'.  'n' marks
          breakpoints that are not enabled.
     _Address_
          Where the breakpoint is in your program, as a memory address.
          For a pending breakpoint whose address is not yet known, this
          field will contain '<PENDING>'.  Such breakpoint won't fire
          until a shared library that has the symbol or line referred by
          breakpoint is loaded.  See below for details.  A breakpoint
          with several locations will have '<MULTIPLE>' in this
          field--see below for details.
     _What_
          Where the breakpoint is in the source for your program, as a
          file and line number.  For a pending breakpoint, the original
          string passed to the breakpoint command will be listed as it
          cannot be resolved until the appropriate shared library is
          loaded in the future.

     If a breakpoint is conditional, there are two evaluation modes:
     "host" and "target".  If mode is "host", breakpoint condition
     evaluation is done by GDB on the host's side.  If it is "target",
     then the condition is evaluated by the target.  The 'info break'
     command shows the condition on the line following the affected
     breakpoint, together with its condition evaluation mode in between
     parentheses.

     Breakpoint commands, if any, are listed after that.  A pending
     breakpoint is allowed to have a condition specified for it.  The
     condition is not parsed for validity until a shared library is
     loaded that allows the pending breakpoint to resolve to a valid
     location.

     'info break' with a breakpoint number N as argument lists only that
     breakpoint.  The convenience variable '$_' and the default
     examining-address for the 'x' command are set to the address of the
     last breakpoint listed (*note Examining Memory: Memory.).

     'info break' displays a count of the number of times the breakpoint
     has been hit.  This is especially useful in conjunction with the
     'ignore' command.  You can ignore a large number of breakpoint
     hits, look at the breakpoint info to see how many times the
     breakpoint was hit, and then run again, ignoring one less than that
     number.  This will get you quickly to the last hit of that
     breakpoint.

     For a breakpoints with an enable count (xref) greater than 1, 'info
     break' also displays that count.

   GDB allows you to set any number of breakpoints at the same place in
your program.  There is nothing silly or meaningless about this.  When
the breakpoints are conditional, this is even useful (*note Break
Conditions: Conditions.).

   It is possible that a breakpoint corresponds to several locations in
your program.  Examples of this situation are:

   * Multiple functions in the program may have the same name.

   * For a C++ constructor, the GCC compiler generates several instances
     of the function body, used in different cases.

   * For a C++ template function, a given line in the function can
     correspond to any number of instantiations.

   * For an inlined function, a given source line can correspond to
     several places where that function is inlined.

   In all those cases, GDB will insert a breakpoint at all the relevant
locations.

   A breakpoint with multiple locations is displayed in the breakpoint
table using several rows--one header row, followed by one row for each
breakpoint location.  The header row has '<MULTIPLE>' in the address
column.  The rows for individual locations contain the actual addresses
for locations, and show the functions to which those locations belong.
The number column for a location is of the form
BREAKPOINT-NUMBER.LOCATION-NUMBER.

   For example:

     Num     Type           Disp Enb  Address    What
     1       breakpoint     keep y    <MULTIPLE>
             stop only if i==1
             breakpoint already hit 1 time
     1.1                         y    0x080486a2 in void foo<int>() at t.cc:8
     1.2                         y    0x080486ca in void foo<double>() at t.cc:8

   Each location can be individually enabled or disabled by passing
BREAKPOINT-NUMBER.LOCATION-NUMBER as argument to the 'enable' and
'disable' commands.  Note that you cannot delete the individual
locations from the list, you can only delete the entire list of
locations that belong to their parent breakpoint (with the 'delete NUM'
command, where NUM is the number of the parent breakpoint, 1 in the
above example).  Disabling or enabling the parent breakpoint (*note
Disabling::) affects all of the locations that belong to that
breakpoint.

   It's quite common to have a breakpoint inside a shared library.
Shared libraries can be loaded and unloaded explicitly, and possibly
repeatedly, as the program is executed.  To support this use case, GDB
updates breakpoint locations whenever any shared library is loaded or
unloaded.  Typically, you would set a breakpoint in a shared library at
the beginning of your debugging session, when the library is not loaded,
and when the symbols from the library are not available.  When you try
to set breakpoint, GDB will ask you if you want to set a so called
"pending breakpoint"--breakpoint whose address is not yet resolved.

   After the program is run, whenever a new shared library is loaded,
GDB reevaluates all the breakpoints.  When a newly loaded shared library
contains the symbol or line referred to by some pending breakpoint, that
breakpoint is resolved and becomes an ordinary breakpoint.  When a
library is unloaded, all breakpoints that refer to its symbols or source
lines become pending again.

   This logic works for breakpoints with multiple locations, too.  For
example, if you have a breakpoint in a C++ template function, and a
newly loaded shared library has an instantiation of that template, a new
location is added to the list of locations for the breakpoint.

   Except for having unresolved address, pending breakpoints do not
differ from regular breakpoints.  You can set conditions or commands,
enable and disable them and perform other breakpoint operations.

   GDB provides some additional commands for controlling what happens
when the 'break' command cannot resolve breakpoint address specification
to an address:

'set breakpoint pending auto'
     This is the default behavior.  When GDB cannot find the breakpoint
     location, it queries you whether a pending breakpoint should be
     created.

'set breakpoint pending on'
     This indicates that an unrecognized breakpoint location should
     automatically result in a pending breakpoint being created.

'set breakpoint pending off'
     This indicates that pending breakpoints are not to be created.  Any
     unrecognized breakpoint location results in an error.  This setting
     does not affect any pending breakpoints previously created.

'show breakpoint pending'
     Show the current behavior setting for creating pending breakpoints.

   The settings above only affect the 'break' command and its variants.
Once breakpoint is set, it will be automatically updated as shared
libraries are loaded and unloaded.

   For some targets, GDB can automatically decide if hardware or
software breakpoints should be used, depending on whether the breakpoint
address is read-only or read-write.  This applies to breakpoints set
with the 'break' command as well as to internal breakpoints set by
commands like 'next' and 'finish'.  For breakpoints set with 'hbreak',
GDB will always use hardware breakpoints.

   You can control this automatic behaviour with the following
commands::

'set breakpoint auto-hw on'
     This is the default behavior.  When GDB sets a breakpoint, it will
     try to use the target memory map to decide if software or hardware
     breakpoint must be used.

'set breakpoint auto-hw off'
     This indicates GDB should not automatically select breakpoint type.
     If the target provides a memory map, GDB will warn when trying to
     set software breakpoint at a read-only address.

   GDB normally implements breakpoints by replacing the program code at
the breakpoint address with a special instruction, which, when executed,
given control to the debugger.  By default, the program code is so
modified only when the program is resumed.  As soon as the program
stops, GDB restores the original instructions.  This behaviour guards
against leaving breakpoints inserted in the target should gdb abrubptly
disconnect.  However, with slow remote targets, inserting and removing
breakpoint can reduce the performance.  This behavior can be controlled
with the following commands::

'set breakpoint always-inserted off'
     All breakpoints, including newly added by the user, are inserted in
     the target only when the target is resumed.  All breakpoints are
     removed from the target when it stops.

'set breakpoint always-inserted on'
     Causes all breakpoints to be inserted in the target at all times.
     If the user adds a new breakpoint, or changes an existing
     breakpoint, the breakpoints in the target are updated immediately.
     A breakpoint is removed from the target only when breakpoint itself
     is removed.

'set breakpoint always-inserted auto'
     This is the default mode.  If GDB is controlling the inferior in
     non-stop mode (*note Non-Stop Mode::), gdb behaves as if
     'breakpoint always-inserted' mode is on.  If GDB is controlling the
     inferior in all-stop mode, GDB behaves as if 'breakpoint
     always-inserted' mode is off.

   GDB handles conditional breakpoints by evaluating these conditions
when a breakpoint breaks.  If the condition is true, then the process
being debugged stops, otherwise the process is resumed.

   If the target supports evaluating conditions on its end, GDB may
download the breakpoint, together with its conditions, to it.

   This feature can be controlled via the following commands:

'set breakpoint condition-evaluation host'
     This option commands GDB to evaluate the breakpoint conditions on
     the host's side.  Unconditional breakpoints are sent to the target
     which in turn receives the triggers and reports them back to GDB
     for condition evaluation.  This is the standard evaluation mode.

'set breakpoint condition-evaluation target'
     This option commands GDB to download breakpoint conditions to the
     target at the moment of their insertion.  The target is responsible
     for evaluating the conditional expression and reporting breakpoint
     stop events back to GDB whenever the condition is true.  Due to
     limitations of target-side evaluation, some conditions cannot be
     evaluated there, e.g., conditions that depend on local data that is
     only known to the host.  Examples include conditional expressions
     involving convenience variables, complex types that cannot be
     handled by the agent expression parser and expressions that are too
     long to be sent over to the target, specially when the target is a
     remote system.  In these cases, the conditions will be evaluated by
     GDB.

'set breakpoint condition-evaluation auto'
     This is the default mode.  If the target supports evaluating
     breakpoint conditions on its end, GDB will download breakpoint
     conditions to the target (limitations mentioned previously apply).
     If the target does not support breakpoint condition evaluation,
     then GDB will fallback to evaluating all these conditions on the
     host's side.

   GDB itself sometimes sets breakpoints in your program for special
purposes, such as proper handling of 'longjmp' (in C programs).  These
internal breakpoints are assigned negative numbers, starting with '-1';
'info breakpoints' does not display them.  You can see these breakpoints
with the GDB maintenance command 'maint info breakpoints' (*note maint
info breakpoints::).

5.1.2 Setting Watchpoints
-------------------------

You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an
expression changes, without having to predict a particular place where
this may happen.  (This is sometimes called a "data breakpoint".)  The
expression may be as simple as the value of a single variable, or as
complex as many variables combined by operators.  Examples include:

   * A reference to the value of a single variable.

   * An address cast to an appropriate data type.  For example, '*(int
     *)0x12345678' will watch a 4-byte region at the specified address
     (assuming an 'int' occupies 4 bytes).

   * An arbitrarily complex expression, such as 'a*b + c/d'.  The
     expression can use any operators valid in the program's native
     language (*note Languages::).

   You can set a watchpoint on an expression even if the expression can
not be evaluated yet.  For instance, you can set a watchpoint on
'*global_ptr' before 'global_ptr' is initialized.  GDB will stop when
your program sets 'global_ptr' and the expression produces a valid
value.  If the expression becomes valid in some other way than changing
a variable (e.g. if the memory pointed to by '*global_ptr' becomes
readable as the result of a 'malloc' call), GDB may not stop until the
next time the expression changes.

   Depending on your system, watchpoints may be implemented in software
or hardware.  GDB does software watchpointing by single-stepping your
program and testing the variable's value each time, which is hundreds of
times slower than normal execution.  (But this may still be worth it, to
catch errors where you have no clue what part of your program is the
culprit.)

   On some systems, such as HP-UX, PowerPC, GNU/Linux and most other
x86-based targets, GDB includes support for hardware watchpoints, which
do not slow down the running of your program.

'watch [-l|-location] EXPR [thread THREADNUM] [mask MASKVALUE]'
     Set a watchpoint for an expression.  GDB will break when the
     expression EXPR is written into by the program and its value
     changes.  The simplest (and the most popular) use of this command
     is to watch the value of a single variable:

          (gdb) watch foo

     If the command includes a '[thread THREADNUM]' argument, GDB breaks
     only when the thread identified by THREADNUM changes the value of
     EXPR.  If any other threads change the value of EXPR, GDB will not
     break.  Note that watchpoints restricted to a single thread in this
     way only work with Hardware Watchpoints.

     Ordinarily a watchpoint respects the scope of variables in EXPR
     (see below).  The '-location' argument tells GDB to instead watch
     the memory referred to by EXPR.  In this case, GDB will evaluate
     EXPR, take the address of the result, and watch the memory at that
     address.  The type of the result is used to determine the size of
     the watched memory.  If the expression's result does not have an
     address, then GDB will print an error.

     The '[mask MASKVALUE]' argument allows creation of masked
     watchpoints, if the current architecture supports this feature
     (e.g., PowerPC Embedded architecture, see *note PowerPC
     Embedded::.)  A "masked watchpoint" specifies a mask in addition to
     an address to watch.  The mask specifies that some bits of an
     address (the bits which are reset in the mask) should be ignored
     when matching the address accessed by the inferior against the
     watchpoint address.  Thus, a masked watchpoint watches many
     addresses simultaneously--those addresses whose unmasked bits are
     identical to the unmasked bits in the watchpoint address.  The
     'mask' argument implies '-location'.  Examples:

          (gdb) watch foo mask 0xffff00ff
          (gdb) watch *0xdeadbeef mask 0xffffff00

'rwatch [-l|-location] EXPR [thread THREADNUM] [mask MASKVALUE]'
     Set a watchpoint that will break when the value of EXPR is read by
     the program.

'awatch [-l|-location] EXPR [thread THREADNUM] [mask MASKVALUE]'
     Set a watchpoint that will break when EXPR is either read from or
     written into by the program.

'info watchpoints [N...]'
     This command prints a list of watchpoints, using the same format as
     'info break' (*note Set Breaks::).

   If you watch for a change in a numerically entered address you need
to dereference it, as the address itself is just a constant number which
will never change.  GDB refuses to create a watchpoint that watches a
never-changing value:

     (gdb) watch 0x600850
     Cannot watch constant value 0x600850.
     (gdb) watch *(int *) 0x600850
     Watchpoint 1: *(int *) 6293584

   GDB sets a "hardware watchpoint" if possible.  Hardware watchpoints
execute very quickly, and the debugger reports a change in value at the
exact instruction where the change occurs.  If GDB cannot set a hardware
watchpoint, it sets a software watchpoint, which executes more slowly
and reports the change in value at the next _statement_, not the
instruction, after the change occurs.

   You can force GDB to use only software watchpoints with the 'set
can-use-hw-watchpoints 0' command.  With this variable set to zero, GDB
will never try to use hardware watchpoints, even if the underlying
system supports them.  (Note that hardware-assisted watchpoints that
were set _before_ setting 'can-use-hw-watchpoints' to zero will still
use the hardware mechanism of watching expression values.)

'set can-use-hw-watchpoints'
     Set whether or not to use hardware watchpoints.

'show can-use-hw-watchpoints'
     Show the current mode of using hardware watchpoints.

   For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware
watchpoints GDB will use, see *note set remote
hardware-breakpoint-limit::.

   When you issue the 'watch' command, GDB reports

     Hardware watchpoint NUM: EXPR

if it was able to set a hardware watchpoint.

   Currently, the 'awatch' and 'rwatch' commands can only set hardware
watchpoints, because accesses to data that don't change the value of the
watched expression cannot be detected without examining every
instruction as it is being executed, and GDB does not do that currently.
If GDB finds that it is unable to set a hardware breakpoint with the
'awatch' or 'rwatch' command, it will print a message like this:

     Expression cannot be implemented with read/access watchpoint.

   Sometimes, GDB cannot set a hardware watchpoint because the data type
of the watched expression is wider than what a hardware watchpoint on
the target machine can handle.  For example, some systems can only watch
regions that are up to 4 bytes wide; on such systems you cannot set
hardware watchpoints for an expression that yields a double-precision
floating-point number (which is typically 8 bytes wide).  As a
work-around, it might be possible to break the large region into a
series of smaller ones and watch them with separate watchpoints.

   If you set too many hardware watchpoints, GDB might be unable to
insert all of them when you resume the execution of your program.  Since
the precise number of active watchpoints is unknown until such time as
the program is about to be resumed, GDB might not be able to warn you
about this when you set the watchpoints, and the warning will be printed
only when the program is resumed:

     Hardware watchpoint NUM: Could not insert watchpoint

If this happens, delete or disable some of the watchpoints.

   Watching complex expressions that reference many variables can also
exhaust the resources available for hardware-assisted watchpoints.
That's because GDB needs to watch every variable in the expression with
separately allocated resources.

   If you call a function interactively using 'print' or 'call', any
watchpoints you have set will be inactive until GDB reaches another kind
of breakpoint or the call completes.

   GDB automatically deletes watchpoints that watch local (automatic)
variables, or expressions that involve such variables, when they go out
of scope, that is, when the execution leaves the block in which these
variables were defined.  In particular, when the program being debugged
terminates, _all_ local variables go out of scope, and so only
watchpoints that watch global variables remain set.  If you rerun the
program, you will need to set all such watchpoints again.  One way of
doing that would be to set a code breakpoint at the entry to the 'main'
function and when it breaks, set all the watchpoints.

   In multi-threaded programs, watchpoints will detect changes to the
watched expression from every thread.

     _Warning:_ In multi-threaded programs, software watchpoints have
     only limited usefulness.  If GDB creates a software watchpoint, it
     can only watch the value of an expression _in a single thread_.  If
     you are confident that the expression can only change due to the
     current thread's activity (and if you are also confident that no
     other thread can become current), then you can use software
     watchpoints as usual.  However, GDB may not notice when a
     non-current thread's activity changes the expression.  (Hardware
     watchpoints, in contrast, watch an expression in all threads.)

5.1.3 Setting Catchpoints
-------------------------

You can use "catchpoints" to cause the debugger to stop for certain
kinds of program events, such as C++ exceptions or the loading of a
shared library.  Use the 'catch' command to set a catchpoint.

'catch EVENT'
     Stop when EVENT occurs.  The EVENT can be any of the following:

     'throw [REGEXP]'
     'rethrow [REGEXP]'
     'catch [REGEXP]'
          The throwing, re-throwing, or catching of a C++ exception.

          If REGEXP is given, then only exceptions whose type matches
          the regular expression will be caught.

          The convenience variable '$_exception' is available at an
          exception-related catchpoint, on some systems.  This holds the
          exception being thrown.

          There are currently some limitations to C++ exception handling
          in GDB:

             * The support for these commands is system-dependent.
               Currently, only systems using the 'gnu-v3' C++ ABI (*note
               ABI::) are supported.

             * The regular expression feature and the '$_exception'
               convenience variable rely on the presence of some SDT
               probes in 'libstdc++'.  If these probes are not present,
               then these features cannot be used.  These probes were
               first available in the GCC 4.8 release, but whether or
               not they are available in your GCC also depends on how it
               was built.

             * The '$_exception' convenience variable is only valid at
               the instruction at which an exception-related catchpoint
               is set.

             * When an exception-related catchpoint is hit, GDB stops at
               a location in the system library which implements runtime
               exception support for C++, usually 'libstdc++'.  You can
               use 'up' (*note Selection::) to get to your code.

             * If you call a function interactively, GDB normally
               returns control to you when the function has finished
               executing.  If the call raises an exception, however, the
               call may bypass the mechanism that returns control to you
               and cause your program either to abort or to simply
               continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a
               signal that GDB is listening for, or exits.  This is the
               case even if you set a catchpoint for the exception;
               catchpoints on exceptions are disabled within interactive
               calls.  *Note Calling::, for information on controlling
               this with 'set unwind-on-terminating-exception'.

             * You cannot raise an exception interactively.

             * You cannot install an exception handler interactively.

     'exception'
          An Ada exception being raised.  If an exception name is
          specified at the end of the command (eg 'catch exception
          Program_Error'), the debugger will stop only when this
          specific exception is raised.  Otherwise, the debugger stops
          execution when any Ada exception is raised.

          When inserting an exception catchpoint on a user-defined
          exception whose name is identical to one of the exceptions
          defined by the language, the fully qualified name must be used
          as the exception name.  Otherwise, GDB will assume that it
          should stop on the pre-defined exception rather than the
          user-defined one.  For instance, assuming an exception called
          'Constraint_Error' is defined in package 'Pck', then the
          command to use to catch such exceptions is 'catch exception
          Pck.Constraint_Error'.

     'exception unhandled'
          An exception that was raised but is not handled by the
          program.

     'assert'
          A failed Ada assertion.

     'exec'
          A call to 'exec'.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
          and GNU/Linux.

     'syscall'
     'syscall [NAME | NUMBER] ...'
          A call to or return from a system call, a.k.a. "syscall".  A
          syscall is a mechanism for application programs to request a
          service from the operating system (OS) or one of the OS system
          services.  GDB can catch some or all of the syscalls issued by
          the debuggee, and show the related information for each
          syscall.  If no argument is specified, calls to and returns
          from all system calls will be caught.

          NAME can be any system call name that is valid for the
          underlying OS. Just what syscalls are valid depends on the OS.
          On GNU and Unix systems, you can find the full list of valid
          syscall names on '/usr/include/asm/unistd.h'.

          Normally, GDB knows in advance which syscalls are valid for
          each OS, so you can use the GDB command-line completion
          facilities (*note command completion: Completion.) to list the
          available choices.

          You may also specify the system call numerically.  A syscall's
          number is the value passed to the OS's syscall dispatcher to
          identify the requested service.  When you specify the syscall
          by its name, GDB uses its database of syscalls to convert the
          name into the corresponding numeric code, but using the number
          directly may be useful if GDB's database does not have the
          complete list of syscalls on your system (e.g., because GDB
          lags behind the OS upgrades).

          The example below illustrates how this command works if you
          don't provide arguments to it:

               (gdb) catch syscall
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'close'), \
               	   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.

               Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'close'), \
               	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb)

          Here is an example of catching a system call by name:

               (gdb) catch syscall chroot
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'chroot' [61])
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'chroot'), \
               		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.

               Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'chroot'), \
               	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb)

          An example of specifying a system call numerically.  In the
          case below, the syscall number has a corresponding entry in
          the XML file, so GDB finds its name and prints it:

               (gdb) catch syscall 252
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 'exit_group')
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'exit_group'), \
               		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.

               Program exited normally.
               (gdb)

          However, there can be situations when there is no
          corresponding name in XML file for that syscall number.  In
          this case, GDB prints a warning message saying that it was not
          able to find the syscall name, but the catchpoint will be set
          anyway.  See the example below:

               (gdb) catch syscall 764
               warning: The number '764' does not represent a known syscall.
               Catchpoint 2 (syscall 764)
               (gdb)

          If you configure GDB using the '--without-expat' option, it
          will not be able to display syscall names.  Also, if your
          architecture does not have an XML file describing its system
          calls, you will not be able to see the syscall names.  It is
          important to notice that these two features are used for
          accessing the syscall name database.  In either case, you will
          see a warning like this:

               (gdb) catch syscall
               warning: Could not open "syscalls/i386-linux.xml"
               warning: Could not load the syscall XML file 'syscalls/i386-linux.xml'.
               GDB will not be able to display syscall names.
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
               (gdb)

          Of course, the file name will change depending on your
          architecture and system.

          Still using the example above, you can also try to catch a
          syscall by its number.  In this case, you would see something
          like:

               (gdb) catch syscall 252
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 252)

          Again, in this case GDB would not be able to display syscall's
          names.

     'fork'
          A call to 'fork'.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
          and GNU/Linux.

     'vfork'
          A call to 'vfork'.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
          and GNU/Linux.

     'load [regexp]'
     'unload [regexp]'
          The loading or unloading of a shared library.  If REGEXP is
          given, then the catchpoint will stop only if the regular
          expression matches one of the affected libraries.

     'signal [SIGNAL... | 'all']'
          The delivery of a signal.

          With no arguments, this catchpoint will catch any signal that
          is not used internally by GDB, specifically, all signals
          except 'SIGTRAP' and 'SIGINT'.

          With the argument 'all', all signals, including those used by
          GDB, will be caught.  This argument cannot be used with other
          signal names.

          Otherwise, the arguments are a list of signal names as given
          to 'handle' (*note Signals::).  Only signals specified in this
          list will be caught.

          One reason that 'catch signal' can be more useful than
          'handle' is that you can attach commands and conditions to the
          catchpoint.

          When a signal is caught by a catchpoint, the signal's 'stop'
          and 'print' settings, as specified by 'handle', are ignored.
          However, whether the signal is still delivered to the inferior
          depends on the 'pass' setting; this can be changed in the
          catchpoint's commands.

'tcatch EVENT'
     Set a catchpoint that is enabled only for one stop.  The catchpoint
     is automatically deleted after the first time the event is caught.

   Use the 'info break' command to list the current catchpoints.

5.1.4 Deleting Breakpoints
--------------------------

It is often necessary to eliminate a breakpoint, watchpoint, or
catchpoint once it has done its job and you no longer want your program
to stop there.  This is called "deleting" the breakpoint.  A breakpoint
that has been deleted no longer exists; it is forgotten.

   With the 'clear' command you can delete breakpoints according to
where they are in your program.  With the 'delete' command you can
delete individual breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints by specifying
their breakpoint numbers.

   It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it.  GDB
automatically ignores breakpoints on the first instruction to be
executed when you continue execution without changing the execution
address.

'clear'
     Delete any breakpoints at the next instruction to be executed in
     the selected stack frame (*note Selecting a Frame: Selection.).
     When the innermost frame is selected, this is a good way to delete
     a breakpoint where your program just stopped.

'clear LOCATION'
     Delete any breakpoints set at the specified LOCATION.  *Note
     Specify Location::, for the various forms of LOCATION; the most
     useful ones are listed below:

     'clear FUNCTION'
     'clear FILENAME:FUNCTION'
          Delete any breakpoints set at entry to the named FUNCTION.

     'clear LINENUM'
     'clear FILENAME:LINENUM'
          Delete any breakpoints set at or within the code of the
          specified LINENUM of the specified FILENAME.

'delete [breakpoints] [RANGE...]'
     Delete the breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints of the
     breakpoint ranges specified as arguments.  If no argument is
     specified, delete all breakpoints (GDB asks confirmation, unless
     you have 'set confirm off').  You can abbreviate this command as
     'd'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Disabling,  Next: Conditions,  Prev: Delete Breaks,  Up: Breakpoints

5.1.5 Disabling Breakpoints
---------------------------

Rather than deleting a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint, you might
prefer to "disable" it.  This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if it
had been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so
that you can "enable" it again later.

   You disable and enable breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints with
the 'enable' and 'disable' commands, optionally specifying one or more
breakpoint numbers as arguments.  Use 'info break' to print a list of
all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints if you do not know which
numbers to use.

   Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations
affects all of its locations.

   A breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint can have any of several
different states of enablement:

   * Enabled.  The breakpoint stops your program.  A breakpoint set with
     the 'break' command starts out in this state.
   * Disabled.  The breakpoint has no effect on your program.
   * Enabled once.  The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes
     disabled.
   * Enabled for a count.  The breakpoint stops your program for the
     next N times, then becomes disabled.
   * Enabled for deletion.  The breakpoint stops your program, but
     immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently.  A
     breakpoint set with the 'tbreak' command starts out in this state.

   You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints,
watchpoints, and catchpoints:

'disable [breakpoints] [RANGE...]'
     Disable the specified breakpoints--or all breakpoints, if none are
     listed.  A disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten.
     All options such as ignore-counts, conditions and commands are
     remembered in case the breakpoint is enabled again later.  You may
     abbreviate 'disable' as 'dis'.

'enable [breakpoints] [RANGE...]'
     Enable the specified breakpoints (or all defined breakpoints).
     They become effective once again in stopping your program.

'enable [breakpoints] once RANGE...'
     Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  GDB disables any of
     these breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.

'enable [breakpoints] count COUNT RANGE...'
     Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  GDB records COUNT
     with each of the specified breakpoints, and decrements a
     breakpoint's count when it is hit.  When any count reaches 0, GDB
     disables that breakpoint.  If a breakpoint has an ignore count
     (*note Break Conditions: Conditions.), that will be decremented to
     0 before COUNT is affected.

'enable [breakpoints] delete RANGE...'
     Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die.  GDB
     deletes any of these breakpoints as soon as your program stops
     there.  Breakpoints set by the 'tbreak' command start out in this
     state.

   Except for a breakpoint set with 'tbreak' (*note Setting Breakpoints:
Set Breaks.), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled;
subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of
the commands above.  (The command 'until' can set and delete a
breakpoint of its own, but it does not change the state of your other
breakpoints; see *note Continuing and Stepping: Continuing and
Stepping.)


File: gdb.info,  Node: Conditions,  Next: Break Commands,  Prev: Disabling,  Up: Breakpoints

5.1.6 Break Conditions
----------------------

The simplest sort of breakpoint breaks every time your program reaches a
specified place.  You can also specify a "condition" for a breakpoint.
A condition is just a Boolean expression in your programming language
(*note Expressions: Expressions.).  A breakpoint with a condition
evaluates the expression each time your program reaches it, and your
program stops only if the condition is _true_.

   This is the converse of using assertions for program validation; in
that situation, you want to stop when the assertion is violated--that
is, when the condition is false.  In C, if you want to test an assertion
expressed by the condition ASSERT, you should set the condition '!
ASSERT' on the appropriate breakpoint.

   Conditions are also accepted for watchpoints; you may not need them,
since a watchpoint is inspecting the value of an expression anyhow--but
it might be simpler, say, to just set a watchpoint on a variable name,
and specify a condition that tests whether the new value is an
interesting one.

   Break conditions can have side effects, and may even call functions
in your program.  This can be useful, for example, to activate functions
that log program progress, or to use your own print functions to format
special data structures.  The effects are completely predictable unless
there is another enabled breakpoint at the same address.  (In that case,
GDB might see the other breakpoint first and stop your program without
checking the condition of this one.)  Note that breakpoint commands are
usually more convenient and flexible than break conditions for the
purpose of performing side effects when a breakpoint is reached (*note
Breakpoint Command Lists: Break Commands.).

   Breakpoint conditions can also be evaluated on the target's side if
the target supports it.  Instead of evaluating the conditions locally,
GDB encodes the expression into an agent expression (*note Agent
Expressions::) suitable for execution on the target, independently of
GDB.  Global variables become raw memory locations, locals become stack
accesses, and so forth.

   In this case, GDB will only be notified of a breakpoint trigger when
its condition evaluates to true.  This mechanism may provide faster
response times depending on the performance characteristics of the
target since it does not need to keep GDB informed about every
breakpoint trigger, even those with false conditions.

   Break conditions can be specified when a breakpoint is set, by using
'if' in the arguments to the 'break' command.  *Note Setting
Breakpoints: Set Breaks.  They can also be changed at any time with the
'condition' command.

   You can also use the 'if' keyword with the 'watch' command.  The
'catch' command does not recognize the 'if' keyword; 'condition' is the
only way to impose a further condition on a catchpoint.

'condition BNUM EXPRESSION'
     Specify EXPRESSION as the break condition for breakpoint,
     watchpoint, or catchpoint number BNUM.  After you set a condition,
     breakpoint BNUM stops your program only if the value of EXPRESSION
     is true (nonzero, in C). When you use 'condition', GDB checks
     EXPRESSION immediately for syntactic correctness, and to determine
     whether symbols in it have referents in the context of your
     breakpoint.  If EXPRESSION uses symbols not referenced in the
     context of the breakpoint, GDB prints an error message:

          No symbol "foo" in current context.

     GDB does not actually evaluate EXPRESSION at the time the
     'condition' command (or a command that sets a breakpoint with a
     condition, like 'break if ...') is given, however.  *Note
     Expressions: Expressions.

'condition BNUM'
     Remove the condition from breakpoint number BNUM.  It becomes an
     ordinary unconditional breakpoint.

   A special case of a breakpoint condition is to stop only when the
breakpoint has been reached a certain number of times.  This is so
useful that there is a special way to do it, using the "ignore count" of
the breakpoint.  Every breakpoint has an ignore count, which is an
integer.  Most of the time, the ignore count is zero, and therefore has
no effect.  But if your program reaches a breakpoint whose ignore count
is positive, then instead of stopping, it just decrements the ignore
count by one and continues.  As a result, if the ignore count value is
N, the breakpoint does not stop the next N times your program reaches
it.

'ignore BNUM COUNT'
     Set the ignore count of breakpoint number BNUM to COUNT.  The next
     COUNT times the breakpoint is reached, your program's execution
     does not stop; other than to decrement the ignore count, GDB takes
     no action.

     To make the breakpoint stop the next time it is reached, specify a
     count of zero.

     When you use 'continue' to resume execution of your program from a
     breakpoint, you can specify an ignore count directly as an argument
     to 'continue', rather than using 'ignore'.  *Note Continuing and
     Stepping: Continuing and Stepping.

     If a breakpoint has a positive ignore count and a condition, the
     condition is not checked.  Once the ignore count reaches zero, GDB
     resumes checking the condition.

     You could achieve the effect of the ignore count with a condition
     such as '$foo-- <= 0' using a debugger convenience variable that is
     decremented each time.  *Note Convenience Variables: Convenience
     Vars.

   Ignore counts apply to breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints.

5.1.7 Breakpoint Command Lists
------------------------------

You can give any breakpoint (or watchpoint or catchpoint) a series of
commands to execute when your program stops due to that breakpoint.  For
example, you might want to print the values of certain expressions, or
enable other breakpoints.

'commands [RANGE...]'
'... COMMAND-LIST ...'
'end'
     Specify a list of commands for the given breakpoints.  The commands
     themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line containing
     just 'end' to terminate the commands.

     To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type 'commands' and
     follow it immediately with 'end'; that is, give no commands.

     With no argument, 'commands' refers to the last breakpoint,
     watchpoint, or catchpoint set (not to the breakpoint most recently
     encountered).  If the most recent breakpoints were set with a
     single command, then the 'commands' will apply to all the
     breakpoints set by that command.  This applies to breakpoints set
     by 'rbreak', and also applies when a single 'break' command creates
     multiple breakpoints (*note Ambiguous Expressions: Ambiguous
     Expressions.).

   Pressing <RET> as a means of repeating the last GDB command is
disabled within a COMMAND-LIST.

   You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.
Simply use the 'continue' command, or 'step', or any other command that
resumes execution.

   Any other commands in the command list, after a command that resumes
execution, are ignored.  This is because any time you resume execution
(even with a simple 'next' or 'step'), you may encounter another
breakpoint--which could have its own command list, leading to
ambiguities about which list to execute.

   If the first command you specify in a command list is 'silent', the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may
be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and
then continue.  If none of the remaining commands print anything, you
see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.  'silent' is meaningful
only at the beginning of a breakpoint command list.

   The commands 'echo', 'output', and 'printf' allow you to print
precisely controlled output, and are often useful in silent breakpoints.
*Note Commands for Controlled Output: Output.

   For example, here is how you could use breakpoint commands to print
the value of 'x' at entry to 'foo' whenever 'x' is positive.

     break foo if x>0
     commands
     silent
     printf "x is %d\n",x
     cont
     end

   One application for breakpoint commands is to compensate for one bug
so you can test for another.  Put a breakpoint just after the erroneous
line of code, give it a condition to detect the case in which something
erroneous has been done, and give it commands to assign correct values
to any variables that need them.  End with the 'continue' command so
that your program does not stop, and start with the 'silent' command so
that no output is produced.  Here is an example:

     break 403
     commands
     silent
     set x = y + 4
     cont
     end


File: gdb.info,  Node: Dynamic Printf,  Next: Save Breakpoints,  Prev: Break Commands,  Up: Breakpoints

5.1.8 Dynamic Printf
--------------------

The dynamic printf command 'dprintf' combines a breakpoint with
formatted printing of your program's data to give you the effect of
inserting 'printf' calls into your program on-the-fly, without having to
recompile it.

   In its most basic form, the output goes to the GDB console.  However,
you can set the variable 'dprintf-style' for alternate handling.  For
instance, you can ask to format the output by calling your program's
'printf' function.  This has the advantage that the characters go to the
program's output device, so they can recorded in redirects to files and
so forth.

   If you are doing remote debugging with a stub or agent, you can also
ask to have the printf handled by the remote agent.  In addition to
ensuring that the output goes to the remote program's device along with
any other output the program might produce, you can also ask that the
dprintf remain active even after disconnecting from the remote target.
Using the stub/agent is also more efficient, as it can do everything
without needing to communicate with GDB.

'dprintf LOCATION,TEMPLATE,EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     Whenever execution reaches LOCATION, print the values of one or
     more EXPRESSIONS under the control of the string TEMPLATE.  To
     print several values, separate them with commas.

'set dprintf-style STYLE'
     Set the dprintf output to be handled in one of several different
     styles enumerated below.  A change of style affects all existing
     dynamic printfs immediately.  (If you need individual control over
     the print commands, simply define normal breakpoints with
     explicitly-supplied command lists.)

'gdb'
     Handle the output using the GDB 'printf' command.

'call'
     Handle the output by calling a function in your program (normally
     'printf').

'agent'
     Have the remote debugging agent (such as 'gdbserver') handle the
     output itself.  This style is only available for agents that
     support running commands on the target.

'set dprintf-function FUNCTION'
     Set the function to call if the dprintf style is 'call'.  By
     default its value is 'printf'.  You may set it to any expression.
     that GDB can evaluate to a function, as per the 'call' command.

'set dprintf-channel CHANNEL'
     Set a "channel" for dprintf.  If set to a non-empty value, GDB will
     evaluate it as an expression and pass the result as a first
     argument to the 'dprintf-function', in the manner of 'fprintf' and
     similar functions.  Otherwise, the dprintf format string will be
     the first argument, in the manner of 'printf'.

     As an example, if you wanted 'dprintf' output to go to a logfile
     that is a standard I/O stream assigned to the variable 'mylog', you
     could do the following:

          (gdb) set dprintf-style call
          (gdb) set dprintf-function fprintf
          (gdb) set dprintf-channel mylog
          (gdb) dprintf 25,"at line 25, glob=%d\n",glob
          Dprintf 1 at 0x123456: file main.c, line 25.
          (gdb) info break
          1       dprintf        keep y   0x00123456 in main at main.c:25
                  call (void) fprintf (mylog,"at line 25, glob=%d\n",glob)
                  continue
          (gdb)

     Note that the 'info break' displays the dynamic printf commands as
     normal breakpoint commands; you can thus easily see the effect of
     the variable settings.

'set disconnected-dprintf on'
'set disconnected-dprintf off'
     Choose whether 'dprintf' commands should continue to run if GDB has
     disconnected from the target.  This only applies if the
     'dprintf-style' is 'agent'.

'show disconnected-dprintf off'
     Show the current choice for disconnected 'dprintf'.

   GDB does not check the validity of function and channel, relying on
you to supply values that are meaningful for the contexts in which they
are being used.  For instance, the function and channel may be the
values of local variables, but if that is the case, then all enabled
dynamic prints must be at locations within the scope of those locals.
If evaluation fails, GDB will report an error.

5.1.9 How to save breakpoints to a file
---------------------------------------

To save breakpoint definitions to a file use the 'save breakpoints'
command.

'save breakpoints [FILENAME]'
     This command saves all current breakpoint definitions together with
     their commands and ignore counts, into a file 'FILENAME' suitable
     for use in a later debugging session.  This includes all types of
     breakpoints (breakpoints, watchpoints, catchpoints, tracepoints).
     To read the saved breakpoint definitions, use the 'source' command
     (*note Command Files::).  Note that watchpoints with expressions
     involving local variables may fail to be recreated because it may
     not be possible to access the context where the watchpoint is valid
     anymore.  Because the saved breakpoint definitions are simply a
     sequence of GDB commands that recreate the breakpoints, you can
     edit the file in your favorite editing program, and remove the
     breakpoint definitions you're not interested in, or that can no
     longer be recreated.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Static Probe Points,  Next: Error in Breakpoints,  Prev: Save Breakpoints,  Up: Breakpoints

5.1.10 Static Probe Points
--------------------------

GDB supports "SDT" probes in the code.  SDT stands for Statically
Defined Tracing, and the probes are designed to have a tiny runtime code
and data footprint, and no dynamic relocations.  They are usable from
assembly, C and C++ languages.  See
<http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/UserSpaceProbeImplementation> for
a good reference on how the SDT probes are implemented.

   Currently, 'SystemTap' (<http://sourceware.org/systemtap/>) SDT
probes are supported on ELF-compatible systems.  See
<http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/AddingUserSpaceProbingToApps> for
more information on how to add 'SystemTap' SDT probes in your
applications.

   Some probes have an associated semaphore variable; for instance, this
happens automatically if you defined your probe using a DTrace-style
'.d' file.  If your probe has a semaphore, GDB will automatically enable
it when you specify a breakpoint using the '-probe-stap' notation.  But,
if you put a breakpoint at a probe's location by some other method
(e.g., 'break file:line'), then GDB will not automatically set the
semaphore.

   You can examine the available static static probes using 'info
probes', with optional arguments:

'info probes stap [PROVIDER [NAME [OBJFILE]]]'
     If given, PROVIDER is a regular expression used to match against
     provider names when selecting which probes to list.  If omitted,
     probes by all probes from all providers are listed.

     If given, NAME is a regular expression to match against probe names
     when selecting which probes to list.  If omitted, probe names are
     not considered when deciding whether to display them.

     If given, OBJFILE is a regular expression used to select which
     object files (executable or shared libraries) to examine.  If not
     given, all object files are considered.

'info probes all'
     List the available static probes, from all types.

   A probe may specify up to twelve arguments.  These are available at
the point at which the probe is defined--that is, when the current PC is
at the probe's location.  The arguments are available using the
convenience variables (*note Convenience Vars::)
'$_probe_arg0'...'$_probe_arg11'.  Each probe argument is an integer of
the appropriate size; types are not preserved.  The convenience variable
'$_probe_argc' holds the number of arguments at the current probe point.

   These variables are always available, but attempts to access them at
any location other than a probe point will cause GDB to give an error
message.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Error in Breakpoints,  Next: Breakpoint-related Warnings,  Prev: Static Probe Points,  Up: Breakpoints

5.1.11 "Cannot insert breakpoints"
----------------------------------

If you request too many active hardware-assisted breakpoints and
watchpoints, you will see this error message:

     Stopped; cannot insert breakpoints.
     You may have requested too many hardware breakpoints and watchpoints.

This message is printed when you attempt to resume the program, since
only then GDB knows exactly how many hardware breakpoints and
watchpoints it needs to insert.

   When this message is printed, you need to disable or remove some of
the hardware-assisted breakpoints and watchpoints, and then continue.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Breakpoint-related Warnings,  Prev: Error in Breakpoints,  Up: Breakpoints

5.1.12 "Breakpoint address adjusted..."
---------------------------------------

Some processor architectures place constraints on the addresses at which
breakpoints may be placed.  For architectures thus constrained, GDB will
attempt to adjust the breakpoint's address to comply with the
constraints dictated by the architecture.

   One example of such an architecture is the Fujitsu FR-V. The FR-V is
a VLIW architecture in which a number of RISC-like instructions may be
bundled together for parallel execution.  The FR-V architecture
constrains the location of a breakpoint instruction within such a bundle
to the instruction with the lowest address.  GDB honors this constraint
by adjusting a breakpoint's address to the first in the bundle.

   It is not uncommon for optimized code to have bundles which contain
instructions from different source statements, thus it may happen that a
breakpoint's address will be adjusted from one source statement to
another.  Since this adjustment may significantly alter GDB's breakpoint
related behavior from what the user expects, a warning is printed when
the breakpoint is first set and also when the breakpoint is hit.

   A warning like the one below is printed when setting a breakpoint
that's been subject to address adjustment:

     warning: Breakpoint address adjusted from 0x00010414 to 0x00010410.

   Such warnings are printed both for user settable and GDB's internal
breakpoints.  If you see one of these warnings, you should verify that a
breakpoint set at the adjusted address will have the desired affect.  If
not, the breakpoint in question may be removed and other breakpoints may
be set which will have the desired behavior.  E.g., it may be sufficient
to place the breakpoint at a later instruction.  A conditional
breakpoint may also be useful in some cases to prevent the breakpoint
from triggering too often.

   GDB will also issue a warning when stopping at one of these adjusted
breakpoints:

     warning: Breakpoint 1 address previously adjusted from 0x00010414
     to 0x00010410.

   When this warning is encountered, it may be too late to take remedial
action except in cases where the breakpoint is hit earlier or more
frequently than expected.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Continuing and Stepping,  Next: Skipping Over Functions and Files,  Prev: Breakpoints,  Up: Stopping

5.2 Continuing and Stepping
===========================

"Continuing" means resuming program execution until your program
completes normally.  In contrast, "stepping" means executing just one
more "step" of your program, where "step" may mean either one line of
source code, or one machine instruction (depending on what particular
command you use).  Either when continuing or when stepping, your program
may stop even sooner, due to a breakpoint or a signal.  (If it stops due
to a signal, you may want to use 'handle', or use 'signal 0' to resume
execution.  *Note Signals: Signals.)

'continue [IGNORE-COUNT]'
'c [IGNORE-COUNT]'
'fg [IGNORE-COUNT]'
     Resume program execution, at the address where your program last
     stopped; any breakpoints set at that address are bypassed.  The
     optional argument IGNORE-COUNT allows you to specify a further
     number of times to ignore a breakpoint at this location; its effect
     is like that of 'ignore' (*note Break Conditions: Conditions.).

     The argument IGNORE-COUNT is meaningful only when your program
     stopped due to a breakpoint.  At other times, the argument to
     'continue' is ignored.

     The synonyms 'c' and 'fg' (for "foreground", as the debugged
     program is deemed to be the foreground program) are provided purely
     for convenience, and have exactly the same behavior as 'continue'.

   To resume execution at a different place, you can use 'return' (*note
Returning from a Function: Returning.) to go back to the calling
function; or 'jump' (*note Continuing at a Different Address: Jumping.)
to go to an arbitrary location in your program.

   A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint (*note
Breakpoints; Watchpoints; and Catchpoints: Breakpoints.) at the
beginning of the function or the section of your program where a problem
is believed to lie, run your program until it stops at that breakpoint,
and then step through the suspect area, examining the variables that are
interesting, until you see the problem happen.

'step'
     Continue running your program until control reaches a different
     source line, then stop it and return control to GDB.  This command
     is abbreviated 's'.

          _Warning:_ If you use the 'step' command while control is
          within a function that was compiled without debugging
          information, execution proceeds until control reaches a
          function that does have debugging information.  Likewise, it
          will not step into a function which is compiled without
          debugging information.  To step through functions without
          debugging information, use the 'stepi' command, described
          below.

     The 'step' command only stops at the first instruction of a source
     line.  This prevents the multiple stops that could otherwise occur
     in 'switch' statements, 'for' loops, etc.  'step' continues to stop
     if a function that has debugging information is called within the
     line.  In other words, 'step' _steps inside_ any functions called
     within the line.

     Also, the 'step' command only enters a function if there is line
     number information for the function.  Otherwise it acts like the
     'next' command.  This avoids problems when using 'cc -gl' on MIPS
     machines.  Previously, 'step' entered subroutines if there was any
     debugging information about the routine.

'step COUNT'
     Continue running as in 'step', but do so COUNT times.  If a
     breakpoint is reached, or a signal not related to stepping occurs
     before COUNT steps, stepping stops right away.

'next [COUNT]'
     Continue to the next source line in the current (innermost) stack
     frame.  This is similar to 'step', but function calls that appear
     within the line of code are executed without stopping.  Execution
     stops when control reaches a different line of code at the original
     stack level that was executing when you gave the 'next' command.
     This command is abbreviated 'n'.

     An argument COUNT is a repeat count, as for 'step'.

     The 'next' command only stops at the first instruction of a source
     line.  This prevents multiple stops that could otherwise occur in
     'switch' statements, 'for' loops, etc.

'set step-mode'
'set step-mode on'
     The 'set step-mode on' command causes the 'step' command to stop at
     the first instruction of a function which contains no debug line
     information rather than stepping over it.

     This is useful in cases where you may be interested in inspecting
     the machine instructions of a function which has no symbolic info
     and do not want GDB to automatically skip over this function.

'set step-mode off'
     Causes the 'step' command to step over any functions which contains
     no debug information.  This is the default.

'show step-mode'
     Show whether GDB will stop in or step over functions without source
     line debug information.

'finish'
     Continue running until just after function in the selected stack
     frame returns.  Print the returned value (if any).  This command
     can be abbreviated as 'fin'.

     Contrast this with the 'return' command (*note Returning from a
     Function: Returning.).

'until'
'u'
     Continue running until a source line past the current line, in the
     current stack frame, is reached.  This command is used to avoid
     single stepping through a loop more than once.  It is like the
     'next' command, except that when 'until' encounters a jump, it
     automatically continues execution until the program counter is
     greater than the address of the jump.

     This means that when you reach the end of a loop after single
     stepping though it, 'until' makes your program continue execution
     until it exits the loop.  In contrast, a 'next' command at the end
     of a loop simply steps back to the beginning of the loop, which
     forces you to step through the next iteration.

     'until' always stops your program if it attempts to exit the
     current stack frame.

     'until' may produce somewhat counterintuitive results if the order
     of machine code does not match the order of the source lines.  For
     example, in the following excerpt from a debugging session, the 'f'
     ('frame') command shows that execution is stopped at line '206';
     yet when we use 'until', we get to line '195':

          (gdb) f
          #0  main (argc=4, argv=0xf7fffae8) at m4.c:206
          206                 expand_input();
          (gdb) until
          195             for ( ; argc > 0; NEXTARG) {

     This happened because, for execution efficiency, the compiler had
     generated code for the loop closure test at the end, rather than
     the start, of the loop--even though the test in a C 'for'-loop is
     written before the body of the loop.  The 'until' command appeared
     to step back to the beginning of the loop when it advanced to this
     expression; however, it has not really gone to an earlier
     statement--not in terms of the actual machine code.

     'until' with no argument works by means of single instruction
     stepping, and hence is slower than 'until' with an argument.

'until LOCATION'
'u LOCATION'
     Continue running your program until either the specified LOCATION
     is reached, or the current stack frame returns.  The location is
     any of the forms described in *note Specify Location::.  This form
     of the command uses temporary breakpoints, and hence is quicker
     than 'until' without an argument.  The specified location is
     actually reached only if it is in the current frame.  This implies
     that 'until' can be used to skip over recursive function
     invocations.  For instance in the code below, if the current
     location is line '96', issuing 'until 99' will execute the program
     up to line '99' in the same invocation of factorial, i.e., after
     the inner invocations have returned.

          94	int factorial (int value)
          95	{
          96	    if (value > 1) {
          97            value *= factorial (value - 1);
          98	    }
          99	    return (value);
          100     }

'advance LOCATION'
     Continue running the program up to the given LOCATION.  An argument
     is required, which should be of one of the forms described in *note
     Specify Location::.  Execution will also stop upon exit from the
     current stack frame.  This command is similar to 'until', but
     'advance' will not skip over recursive function calls, and the
     target location doesn't have to be in the same frame as the current
     one.

'stepi'
'stepi ARG'
'si'
     Execute one machine instruction, then stop and return to the
     debugger.

     It is often useful to do 'display/i $pc' when stepping by machine
     instructions.  This makes GDB automatically display the next
     instruction to be executed, each time your program stops.  *Note
     Automatic Display: Auto Display.

     An argument is a repeat count, as in 'step'.

'nexti'
'nexti ARG'
'ni'
     Execute one machine instruction, but if it is a function call,
     proceed until the function returns.

     An argument is a repeat count, as in 'next'.

   By default, and if available, GDB makes use of target-assisted "range
stepping".  In other words, whenever you use a stepping command (e.g.,
'step', 'next'), GDB tells the target to step the corresponding range of
instruction addresses instead of issuing multiple single-steps.  This
speeds up line stepping, particularly for remote targets.  Ideally,
there should be no reason you would want to turn range stepping off.
However, it's possible that a bug in the debug info, a bug in the remote
stub (for remote targets), or even a bug in GDB could make line stepping
behave incorrectly when target-assisted range stepping is enabled.  You
can use the following command to turn off range stepping if necessary:

'set range-stepping'
'show range-stepping'
     Control whether range stepping is enabled.

     If 'on', and the target supports it, GDB tells the target to step a
     range of addresses itself, instead of issuing multiple
     single-steps.  If 'off', GDB always issues single-steps, even if
     range stepping is supported by the target.  The default is 'on'.

5.3 Skipping Over Functions and Files
=====================================

The program you are debugging may contain some functions which are
uninteresting to debug.  The 'skip' comand lets you tell GDB to skip a
function or all functions in a file when stepping.

   For example, consider the following C function:

     101     int func()
     102     {
     103         foo(boring());
     104         bar(boring());
     105     }

Suppose you wish to step into the functions 'foo' and 'bar', but you are
not interested in stepping through 'boring'.  If you run 'step' at line
103, you'll enter 'boring()', but if you run 'next', you'll step over
both 'foo' and 'boring'!

   One solution is to 'step' into 'boring' and use the 'finish' command
to immediately exit it.  But this can become tedious if 'boring' is
called from many places.

   A more flexible solution is to execute 'skip boring'.  This instructs
GDB never to step into 'boring'.  Now when you execute 'step' at line
103, you'll step over 'boring' and directly into 'foo'.

   You can also instruct GDB to skip all functions in a file, with, for
example, 'skip file boring.c'.

'skip [LINESPEC]'
'skip function [LINESPEC]'
     After running this command, the function named by LINESPEC or the
     function containing the line named by LINESPEC will be skipped over
     when stepping.  *Note Specify Location::.

     If you do not specify LINESPEC, the function you're currently
     debugging will be skipped.

     (If you have a function called 'file' that you want to skip, use
     'skip function file'.)

'skip file [FILENAME]'
     After running this command, any function whose source lives in
     FILENAME will be skipped over when stepping.

     If you do not specify FILENAME, functions whose source lives in the
     file you're currently debugging will be skipped.

   Skips can be listed, deleted, disabled, and enabled, much like
breakpoints.  These are the commands for managing your list of skips:

'info skip [RANGE]'
     Print details about the specified skip(s).  If RANGE is not
     specified, print a table with details about all functions and files
     marked for skipping.  'info skip' prints the following information
     about each skip:

     _Identifier_
          A number identifying this skip.
     _Type_
          The type of this skip, either 'function' or 'file'.
     _Enabled or Disabled_
          Enabled skips are marked with 'y'.  Disabled skips are marked
          with 'n'.
     _Address_
          For function skips, this column indicates the address in
          memory of the function being skipped.  If you've set a
          function skip on a function which has not yet been loaded,
          this field will contain '<PENDING>'.  Once a shared library
          which has the function is loaded, 'info skip' will show the
          function's address here.
     _What_
          For file skips, this field contains the filename being
          skipped.  For functions skips, this field contains the
          function name and its line number in the file where it is
          defined.

'skip delete [RANGE]'
     Delete the specified skip(s).  If RANGE is not specified, delete
     all skips.

'skip enable [RANGE]'
     Enable the specified skip(s).  If RANGE is not specified, enable
     all skips.

'skip disable [RANGE]'
     Disable the specified skip(s).  If RANGE is not specified, disable
     all skips.

5.4 Signals
===========

A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program.  The
operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each
kind a name and a number.  For example, in Unix 'SIGINT' is the signal a
program gets when you type an interrupt character (often 'Ctrl-c');
'SIGSEGV' is the signal a program gets from referencing a place in
memory far away from all the areas in use; 'SIGALRM' occurs when the
alarm clock timer goes off (which happens only if your program has
requested an alarm).

   Some signals, including 'SIGALRM', are a normal part of the
functioning of your program.  Others, such as 'SIGSEGV', indicate
errors; these signals are "fatal" (they kill your program immediately)
if the program has not specified in advance some other way to handle the
signal.  'SIGINT' does not indicate an error in your program, but it is
normally fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the interrupt: to kill
the program.

   GDB has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in your
program.  You can tell GDB in advance what to do for each kind of
signal.

   Normally, GDB is set up to let the non-erroneous signals like
'SIGALRM' be silently passed to your program (so as not to interfere
with their role in the program's functioning) but to stop your program
immediately whenever an error signal happens.  You can change these
settings with the 'handle' command.

'info signals'
'info handle'
     Print a table of all the kinds of signals and how GDB has been told
     to handle each one.  You can use this to see the signal numbers of
     all the defined types of signals.

'info signals SIG'
     Similar, but print information only about the specified signal
     number.

     'info handle' is an alias for 'info signals'.

'catch signal [SIGNAL... | 'all']'
     Set a catchpoint for the indicated signals.  *Note Set
     Catchpoints::, for details about this command.

'handle SIGNAL [KEYWORDS...]'
     Change the way GDB handles signal SIGNAL.  The SIGNAL can be the
     number of a signal or its name (with or without the 'SIG' at the
     beginning); a list of signal numbers of the form 'LOW-HIGH'; or the
     word 'all', meaning all the known signals.  Optional arguments
     KEYWORDS, described below, say what change to make.

   The keywords allowed by the 'handle' command can be abbreviated.
Their full names are:

'nostop'
     GDB should not stop your program when this signal happens.  It may
     still print a message telling you that the signal has come in.

'stop'
     GDB should stop your program when this signal happens.  This
     implies the 'print' keyword as well.

'print'
     GDB should print a message when this signal happens.

'noprint'
     GDB should not mention the occurrence of the signal at all.  This
     implies the 'nostop' keyword as well.

'pass'
'noignore'
     GDB should allow your program to see this signal; your program can
     handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal is fatal
     and not handled.  'pass' and 'noignore' are synonyms.

'nopass'
'ignore'
     GDB should not allow your program to see this signal.  'nopass' and
     'ignore' are synonyms.

   When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible to the
program until you continue.  Your program sees the signal then, if
'pass' is in effect for the signal in question _at that time_.  In other
words, after GDB reports a signal, you can use the 'handle' command with
'pass' or 'nopass' to control whether your program sees that signal when
you continue.

   The default is set to 'nostop', 'noprint', 'pass' for non-erroneous
signals such as 'SIGALRM', 'SIGWINCH' and 'SIGCHLD', and to 'stop',
'print', 'pass' for the erroneous signals.

   You can also use the 'signal' command to prevent your program from
seeing a signal, or cause it to see a signal it normally would not see,
or to give it any signal at any time.  For example, if your program
stopped due to some sort of memory reference error, you might store
correct values into the erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see
more execution; but your program would probably terminate immediately as
a result of the fatal signal once it saw the signal.  To prevent this,
you can continue with 'signal 0'.  *Note Giving your Program a Signal:
Signaling.

   On some targets, GDB can inspect extra signal information associated
with the intercepted signal, before it is actually delivered to the
program being debugged.  This information is exported by the convenience
variable '$_siginfo', and consists of data that is passed by the kernel
to the signal handler at the time of the receipt of a signal.  The data
type of the information itself is target dependent.  You can see the
data type using the 'ptype $_siginfo' command.  On Unix systems, it
typically corresponds to the standard 'siginfo_t' type, as defined in
the 'signal.h' system header.

   Here's an example, on a GNU/Linux system, printing the stray
referenced address that raised a segmentation fault.

     (gdb) continue
     Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
     0x0000000000400766 in main ()
     69        *(int *)p = 0;
     (gdb) ptype $_siginfo
     type = struct {
         int si_signo;
         int si_errno;
         int si_code;
         union {
             int _pad[28];
             struct {...} _kill;
             struct {...} _timer;
             struct {...} _rt;
             struct {...} _sigchld;
             struct {...} _sigfault;
             struct {...} _sigpoll;
         } _sifields;
     }
     (gdb) ptype $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault
     type = struct {
         void *si_addr;
     }
     (gdb) p $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr
     $1 = (void *) 0x7ffff7ff7000

   Depending on target support, '$_siginfo' may also be writable.

5.5 Stopping and Starting Multi-thread Programs
===============================================

GDB supports debugging programs with multiple threads (*note Debugging
Programs with Multiple Threads: Threads.).  There are two modes of
controlling execution of your program within the debugger.  In the
default mode, referred to as "all-stop mode", when any thread in your
program stops (for example, at a breakpoint or while being stepped), all
other threads in the program are also stopped by GDB.  On some targets,
GDB also supports "non-stop mode", in which other threads can continue
to run freely while you examine the stopped thread in the debugger.

* Menu:

* All-Stop Mode::		All threads stop when GDB takes control
* Non-Stop Mode::		Other threads continue to execute
* Background Execution::	Running your program asynchronously
* Thread-Specific Breakpoints::	Controlling breakpoints
* Interrupted System Calls::	GDB may interfere with system calls
* Observer Mode::               GDB does not alter program behavior


File: gdb.info,  Node: All-Stop Mode,  Next: Non-Stop Mode,  Up: Thread Stops

5.5.1 All-Stop Mode
-------------------

In all-stop mode, whenever your program stops under GDB for any reason,
_all_ threads of execution stop, not just the current thread.  This
allows you to examine the overall state of the program, including
switching between threads, without worrying that things may change
underfoot.

   Conversely, whenever you restart the program, _all_ threads start
executing.  _This is true even when single-stepping_ with commands like
'step' or 'next'.

   In particular, GDB cannot single-step all threads in lockstep.  Since
thread scheduling is up to your debugging target's operating system (not
controlled by GDB), other threads may execute more than one statement
while the current thread completes a single step.  Moreover, in general
other threads stop in the middle of a statement, rather than at a clean
statement boundary, when the program stops.

   You might even find your program stopped in another thread after
continuing or even single-stepping.  This happens whenever some other
thread runs into a breakpoint, a signal, or an exception before the
first thread completes whatever you requested.

   Whenever GDB stops your program, due to a breakpoint or a signal, it
automatically selects the thread where that breakpoint or signal
happened.  GDB alerts you to the context switch with a message such as
'[Switching to Thread N]' to identify the thread.

   On some OSes, you can modify GDB's default behavior by locking the OS
scheduler to allow only a single thread to run.

'set scheduler-locking MODE'
     Set the scheduler locking mode.  If it is 'off', then there is no
     locking and any thread may run at any time.  If 'on', then only the
     current thread may run when the inferior is resumed.  The 'step'
     mode optimizes for single-stepping; it prevents other threads from
     preempting the current thread while you are stepping, so that the
     focus of debugging does not change unexpectedly.  Other threads
     only rarely (or never) get a chance to run when you step.  They are
     more likely to run when you 'next' over a function call, and they
     are completely free to run when you use commands like 'continue',
     'until', or 'finish'.  However, unless another thread hits a
     breakpoint during its timeslice, GDB does not change the current
     thread away from the thread that you are debugging.

'show scheduler-locking'
     Display the current scheduler locking mode.

   By default, when you issue one of the execution commands such as
'continue', 'next' or 'step', GDB allows only threads of the current
inferior to run.  For example, if GDB is attached to two inferiors, each
with two threads, the 'continue' command resumes only the two threads of
the current inferior.  This is useful, for example, when you debug a
program that forks and you want to hold the parent stopped (so that, for
instance, it doesn't run to exit), while you debug the child.  In other
situations, you may not be interested in inspecting the current state of
any of the processes GDB is attached to, and you may want to resume them
all until some breakpoint is hit.  In the latter case, you can instruct
GDB to allow all threads of all the inferiors to run with the 'set schedule-multiple'
command.

'set schedule-multiple'
     Set the mode for allowing threads of multiple processes to be
     resumed when an execution command is issued.  When 'on', all
     threads of all processes are allowed to run.  When 'off', only the
     threads of the current process are resumed.  The default is 'off'.
     The 'scheduler-locking' mode takes precedence when set to 'on', or
     while you are stepping and set to 'step'.

'show schedule-multiple'
     Display the current mode for resuming the execution of threads of
     multiple processes.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Non-Stop Mode,  Next: Background Execution,  Prev: All-Stop Mode,  Up: Thread Stops

5.5.2 Non-Stop Mode
-------------------

For some multi-threaded targets, GDB supports an optional mode of
operation in which you can examine stopped program threads in the
debugger while other threads continue to execute freely.  This minimizes
intrusion when debugging live systems, such as programs where some
threads have real-time constraints or must continue to respond to
external events.  This is referred to as "non-stop" mode.

   In non-stop mode, when a thread stops to report a debugging event,
_only_ that thread is stopped; GDB does not stop other threads as well,
in contrast to the all-stop mode behavior.  Additionally, execution
commands such as 'continue' and 'step' apply by default only to the
current thread in non-stop mode, rather than all threads as in all-stop
mode.  This allows you to control threads explicitly in ways that are
not possible in all-stop mode -- for example, stepping one thread while
allowing others to run freely, stepping one thread while holding all
others stopped, or stepping several threads independently and
simultaneously.

   To enter non-stop mode, use this sequence of commands before you run
or attach to your program:

     # If using the CLI, pagination breaks non-stop.
     set pagination off

     # Finally, turn it on!
     set non-stop on

   You can use these commands to manipulate the non-stop mode setting:

'set non-stop on'
     Enable selection of non-stop mode.
'set non-stop off'
     Disable selection of non-stop mode.
'show non-stop'
     Show the current non-stop enablement setting.

   Note these commands only reflect whether non-stop mode is enabled,
not whether the currently-executing program is being run in non-stop
mode.  In particular, the 'set non-stop' preference is only consulted
when GDB starts or connects to the target program, and it is generally
not possible to switch modes once debugging has started.  Furthermore,
since not all targets support non-stop mode, even when you have enabled
non-stop mode, GDB may still fall back to all-stop operation by default.

   In non-stop mode, all execution commands apply only to the current
thread by default.  That is, 'continue' only continues one thread.  To
continue all threads, issue 'continue -a' or 'c -a'.

   You can use GDB's background execution commands (*note Background
Execution::) to run some threads in the background while you continue to
examine or step others from GDB.  The MI execution commands (*note
GDB/MI Program Execution::) are always executed asynchronously in
non-stop mode.

   Suspending execution is done with the 'interrupt' command when
running in the background, or 'Ctrl-c' during foreground execution.  In
all-stop mode, this stops the whole process; but in non-stop mode the
interrupt applies only to the current thread.  To stop the whole
program, use 'interrupt -a'.

   Other execution commands do not currently support the '-a' option.

   In non-stop mode, when a thread stops, GDB doesn't automatically make
that thread current, as it does in all-stop mode.  This is because the
thread stop notifications are asynchronous with respect to GDB's command
interpreter, and it would be confusing if GDB unexpectedly changed to a
different thread just as you entered a command to operate on the
previously current thread.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Background Execution,  Next: Thread-Specific Breakpoints,  Prev: Non-Stop Mode,  Up: Thread Stops

5.5.3 Background Execution
--------------------------

GDB's execution commands have two variants: the normal foreground
(synchronous) behavior, and a background (asynchronous) behavior.  In
foreground execution, GDB waits for the program to report that some
thread has stopped before prompting for another command.  In background
execution, GDB immediately gives a command prompt so that you can issue
other commands while your program runs.

   If the target doesn't support async mode, GDB issues an error message
if you attempt to use the background execution commands.

   To specify background execution, add a '&' to the command.  For
example, the background form of the 'continue' command is 'continue&',
or just 'c&'.  The execution commands that accept background execution
are:

'run'
     *Note Starting your Program: Starting.

'attach'
     *Note Debugging an Already-running Process: Attach.

'step'
     *Note step: Continuing and Stepping.

'stepi'
     *Note stepi: Continuing and Stepping.

'next'
     *Note next: Continuing and Stepping.

'nexti'
     *Note nexti: Continuing and Stepping.

'continue'
     *Note continue: Continuing and Stepping.

'finish'
     *Note finish: Continuing and Stepping.

'until'
     *Note until: Continuing and Stepping.

   Background execution is especially useful in conjunction with
non-stop mode for debugging programs with multiple threads; see *note
Non-Stop Mode::.  However, you can also use these commands in the normal
all-stop mode with the restriction that you cannot issue another
execution command until the previous one finishes.  Examples of commands
that are valid in all-stop mode while the program is running include
'help' and 'info break'.

   You can interrupt your program while it is running in the background
by using the 'interrupt' command.

'interrupt'
'interrupt -a'

     Suspend execution of the running program.  In all-stop mode,
     'interrupt' stops the whole process, but in non-stop mode, it stops
     only the current thread.  To stop the whole program in non-stop
     mode, use 'interrupt -a'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Thread-Specific Breakpoints,  Next: Interrupted System Calls,  Prev: Background Execution,  Up: Thread Stops

5.5.4 Thread-Specific Breakpoints
---------------------------------

When your program has multiple threads (*note Debugging Programs with
Multiple Threads: Threads.), you can choose whether to set breakpoints
on all threads, or on a particular thread.

'break LINESPEC thread THREADNO'
'break LINESPEC thread THREADNO if ...'
     LINESPEC specifies source lines; there are several ways of writing
     them (*note Specify Location::), but the effect is always to
     specify some source line.

     Use the qualifier 'thread THREADNO' with a breakpoint command to
     specify that you only want GDB to stop the program when a
     particular thread reaches this breakpoint.  The THREADNO specifier
     is one of the numeric thread identifiers assigned by GDB, shown in
     the first column of the 'info threads' display.

     If you do not specify 'thread THREADNO' when you set a breakpoint,
     the breakpoint applies to _all_ threads of your program.

     You can use the 'thread' qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
     well; in this case, place 'thread THREADNO' before or after the
     breakpoint condition, like this:

          (gdb) break frik.c:13 thread 28 if bartab > lim

   Thread-specific breakpoints are automatically deleted when GDB
detects the corresponding thread is no longer in the thread list.  For
example:

     (gdb) c
     Thread-specific breakpoint 3 deleted - thread 28 no longer in the thread list.

   There are several ways for a thread to disappear, such as a regular
thread exit, but also when you detach from the process with the 'detach'
command (*note Debugging an Already-running Process: Attach.), or if GDB
loses the remote connection (*note Remote Debugging::), etc.  Note that
with some targets, GDB is only able to detect a thread has exited when
the user explictly asks for the thread list with the 'info threads'
command.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Interrupted System Calls,  Next: Observer Mode,  Prev: Thread-Specific Breakpoints,  Up: Thread Stops

5.5.5 Interrupted System Calls
------------------------------

There is an unfortunate side effect when using GDB to debug
multi-threaded programs.  If one thread stops for a breakpoint, or for
some other reason, and another thread is blocked in a system call, then
the system call may return prematurely.  This is a consequence of the
interaction between multiple threads and the signals that GDB uses to
implement breakpoints and other events that stop execution.

   To handle this problem, your program should check the return value of
each system call and react appropriately.  This is good programming
style anyways.

   For example, do not write code like this:

       sleep (10);

   The call to 'sleep' will return early if a different thread stops at
a breakpoint or for some other reason.

   Instead, write this:

       int unslept = 10;
       while (unslept > 0)
         unslept = sleep (unslept);

   A system call is allowed to return early, so the system is still
conforming to its specification.  But GDB does cause your multi-threaded
program to behave differently than it would without GDB.

   Also, GDB uses internal breakpoints in the thread library to monitor
certain events such as thread creation and thread destruction.  When
such an event happens, a system call in another thread may return
prematurely, even though your program does not appear to stop.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Observer Mode,  Prev: Interrupted System Calls,  Up: Thread Stops

5.5.6 Observer Mode
-------------------

If you want to build on non-stop mode and observe program behavior
without any chance of disruption by GDB, you can set variables to
disable all of the debugger's attempts to modify state, whether by
writing memory, inserting breakpoints, etc.  These operate at a low
level, intercepting operations from all commands.

   When all of these are set to 'off', then GDB is said to be "observer
mode".  As a convenience, the variable 'observer' can be set to disable
these, plus enable non-stop mode.

   Note that GDB will not prevent you from making nonsensical
combinations of these settings.  For instance, if you have enabled
'may-insert-breakpoints' but disabled 'may-write-memory', then
breakpoints that work by writing trap instructions into the code stream
will still not be able to be placed.

'set observer on'
'set observer off'
     When set to 'on', this disables all the permission variables below
     (except for 'insert-fast-tracepoints'), plus enables non-stop
     debugging.  Setting this to 'off' switches back to normal
     debugging, though remaining in non-stop mode.

'show observer'
     Show whether observer mode is on or off.

'set may-write-registers on'
'set may-write-registers off'
     This controls whether GDB will attempt to alter the values of
     registers, such as with assignment expressions in 'print', or the
     'jump' command.  It defaults to 'on'.

'show may-write-registers'
     Show the current permission to write registers.

'set may-write-memory on'
'set may-write-memory off'
     This controls whether GDB will attempt to alter the contents of
     memory, such as with assignment expressions in 'print'.  It
     defaults to 'on'.

'show may-write-memory'
     Show the current permission to write memory.

'set may-insert-breakpoints on'
'set may-insert-breakpoints off'
     This controls whether GDB will attempt to insert breakpoints.  This
     affects all breakpoints, including internal breakpoints defined by
     GDB.  It defaults to 'on'.

'show may-insert-breakpoints'
     Show the current permission to insert breakpoints.

'set may-insert-tracepoints on'
'set may-insert-tracepoints off'
     This controls whether GDB will attempt to insert (regular)
     tracepoints at the beginning of a tracing experiment.  It affects
     only non-fast tracepoints, fast tracepoints being under the control
     of 'may-insert-fast-tracepoints'.  It defaults to 'on'.

'show may-insert-tracepoints'
     Show the current permission to insert tracepoints.

'set may-insert-fast-tracepoints on'
'set may-insert-fast-tracepoints off'
     This controls whether GDB will attempt to insert fast tracepoints
     at the beginning of a tracing experiment.  It affects only fast
     tracepoints, regular (non-fast) tracepoints being under the control
     of 'may-insert-tracepoints'.  It defaults to 'on'.

'show may-insert-fast-tracepoints'
     Show the current permission to insert fast tracepoints.

'set may-interrupt on'
'set may-interrupt off'
     This controls whether GDB will attempt to interrupt or stop program
     execution.  When this variable is 'off', the 'interrupt' command
     will have no effect, nor will 'Ctrl-c'.  It defaults to 'on'.

'show may-interrupt'
     Show the current permission to interrupt or stop the program.

6 Running programs backward
***************************

When you are debugging a program, it is not unusual to realize that you
have gone too far, and some event of interest has already happened.  If
the target environment supports it, GDB can allow you to "rewind" the
program by running it backward.

   A target environment that supports reverse execution should be able
to "undo" the changes in machine state that have taken place as the
program was executing normally.  Variables, registers etc. should revert
to their previous values.  Obviously this requires a great deal of
sophistication on the part of the target environment; not all target
environments can support reverse execution.

   When a program is executed in reverse, the instructions that have
most recently been executed are "un-executed", in reverse order.  The
program counter runs backward, following the previous thread of
execution in reverse.  As each instruction is "un-executed", the values
of memory and/or registers that were changed by that instruction are
reverted to their previous states.  After executing a piece of source
code in reverse, all side effects of that code should be "undone", and
all variables should be returned to their prior values(1).

   If you are debugging in a target environment that supports reverse
execution, GDB provides the following commands.

'reverse-continue [IGNORE-COUNT]'
'rc [IGNORE-COUNT]'
     Beginning at the point where your program last stopped, start
     executing in reverse.  Reverse execution will stop for breakpoints
     and synchronous exceptions (signals), just like normal execution.
     Behavior of asynchronous signals depends on the target environment.

'reverse-step [COUNT]'
     Run the program backward until control reaches the start of a
     different source line; then stop it, and return control to GDB.

     Like the 'step' command, 'reverse-step' will only stop at the
     beginning of a source line.  It "un-executes" the previously
     executed source line.  If the previous source line included calls
     to debuggable functions, 'reverse-step' will step (backward) into
     the called function, stopping at the beginning of the _last_
     statement in the called function (typically a return statement).

     Also, as with the 'step' command, if non-debuggable functions are
     called, 'reverse-step' will run thru them backward without
     stopping.

'reverse-stepi [COUNT]'
     Reverse-execute one machine instruction.  Note that the instruction
     to be reverse-executed is _not_ the one pointed to by the program
     counter, but the instruction executed prior to that one.  For
     instance, if the last instruction was a jump, 'reverse-stepi' will
     take you back from the destination of the jump to the jump
     instruction itself.

'reverse-next [COUNT]'
     Run backward to the beginning of the previous line executed in the
     current (innermost) stack frame.  If the line contains function
     calls, they will be "un-executed" without stopping.  Starting from
     the first line of a function, 'reverse-next' will take you back to
     the caller of that function, _before_ the function was called, just
     as the normal 'next' command would take you from the last line of a
     function back to its return to its caller (2).

'reverse-nexti [COUNT]'
     Like 'nexti', 'reverse-nexti' executes a single instruction in
     reverse, except that called functions are "un-executed" atomically.
     That is, if the previously executed instruction was a return from
     another function, 'reverse-nexti' will continue to execute in
     reverse until the call to that function (from the current stack
     frame) is reached.

'reverse-finish'
     Just as the 'finish' command takes you to the point where the
     current function returns, 'reverse-finish' takes you to the point
     where it was called.  Instead of ending up at the end of the
     current function invocation, you end up at the beginning.

'set exec-direction'
     Set the direction of target execution.
'set exec-direction reverse'
     GDB will perform all execution commands in reverse, until the
     exec-direction mode is changed to "forward".  Affected commands
     include 'step, stepi, next, nexti, continue, and finish'.  The
     'return' command cannot be used in reverse mode.
'set exec-direction forward'
     GDB will perform all execution commands in the normal fashion.
     This is the default.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that some side effects are easier to undo than others.  For
instance, memory and registers are relatively easy, but device I/O is
hard.  Some targets may be able undo things like device I/O, and some
may not.

   The contract between GDB and the reverse executing target requires
only that the target do something reasonable when GDB tells it to
execute backwards, and then report the results back to GDB.  Whatever
the target reports back to GDB, GDB will report back to the user.  GDB
assumes that the memory and registers that the target reports are in a
consistant state, but GDB accepts whatever it is given.

   (2) Unless the code is too heavily optimized.

7 Recording Inferior's Execution and Replaying It
*************************************************

On some platforms, GDB provides a special "process record and replay"
target that can record a log of the process execution, and replay it
later with both forward and reverse execution commands.

   When this target is in use, if the execution log includes the record
for the next instruction, GDB will debug in "replay mode".  In the
replay mode, the inferior does not really execute code instructions.
Instead, all the events that normally happen during code execution are
taken from the execution log.  While code is not really executed in
replay mode, the values of registers (including the program counter
register) and the memory of the inferior are still changed as they
normally would.  Their contents are taken from the execution log.

   If the record for the next instruction is not in the execution log,
GDB will debug in "record mode".  In this mode, the inferior executes
normally, and GDB records the execution log for future replay.

   The process record and replay target supports reverse execution
(*note Reverse Execution::), even if the platform on which the inferior
runs does not.  However, the reverse execution is limited in this case
by the range of the instructions recorded in the execution log.  In
other words, reverse execution on platforms that don't support it
directly can only be done in the replay mode.

   When debugging in the reverse direction, GDB will work in replay mode
as long as the execution log includes the record for the previous
instruction; otherwise, it will work in record mode, if the platform
supports reverse execution, or stop if not.

   For architecture environments that support process record and replay,
GDB provides the following commands:

'record METHOD'
     This command starts the process record and replay target.  The
     recording method can be specified as parameter.  Without a
     parameter the command uses the 'full' recording method.  The
     following recording methods are available:

     'full'
          Full record/replay recording using GDB's software record and
          replay implementation.  This method allows replaying and
          reverse execution.

     'btrace'
          Hardware-supported instruction recording.  This method does
          not record data.  Further, the data is collected in a ring
          buffer so old data will be overwritten when the buffer is
          full.  It allows limited replay and reverse execution.

          This recording method may not be available on all processors.

     The process record and replay target can only debug a process that
     is already running.  Therefore, you need first to start the process
     with the 'run' or 'start' commands, and then start the recording
     with the 'record METHOD' command.

     Both 'record METHOD' and 'rec METHOD' are aliases of 'target
     record-METHOD'.

     Displaced stepping (*note displaced stepping: Maintenance
     Commands.) will be automatically disabled when process record and
     replay target is started.  That's because the process record and
     replay target doesn't support displaced stepping.

     If the inferior is in the non-stop mode (*note Non-Stop Mode::) or
     in the asynchronous execution mode (*note Background Execution::),
     not all recording methods are available.  The 'full' recording
     method does not support these two modes.

'record stop'
     Stop the process record and replay target.  When process record and
     replay target stops, the entire execution log will be deleted and
     the inferior will either be terminated, or will remain in its final
     state.

     When you stop the process record and replay target in record mode
     (at the end of the execution log), the inferior will be stopped at
     the next instruction that would have been recorded.  In other
     words, if you record for a while and then stop recording, the
     inferior process will be left in the same state as if the recording
     never happened.

     On the other hand, if the process record and replay target is
     stopped while in replay mode (that is, not at the end of the
     execution log, but at some earlier point), the inferior process
     will become "live" at that earlier state, and it will then be
     possible to continue the usual "live" debugging of the process from
     that state.

     When the inferior process exits, or GDB detaches from it, process
     record and replay target will automatically stop itself.

'record goto'
     Go to a specific location in the execution log.  There are several
     ways to specify the location to go to:

     'record goto begin'
     'record goto start'
          Go to the beginning of the execution log.

     'record goto end'
          Go to the end of the execution log.

     'record goto N'
          Go to instruction number N in the execution log.

'record save FILENAME'
     Save the execution log to a file 'FILENAME'.  Default filename is
     'gdb_record.PROCESS_ID', where PROCESS_ID is the process ID of the
     inferior.

     This command may not be available for all recording methods.

'record restore FILENAME'
     Restore the execution log from a file 'FILENAME'.  File must have
     been created with 'record save'.

'set record full insn-number-max LIMIT'
'set record full insn-number-max unlimited'
     Set the limit of instructions to be recorded for the 'full'
     recording method.  Default value is 200000.

     If LIMIT is a positive number, then GDB will start deleting
     instructions from the log once the number of the record
     instructions becomes greater than LIMIT.  For every new recorded
     instruction, GDB will delete the earliest recorded instruction to
     keep the number of recorded instructions at the limit.  (Since
     deleting recorded instructions loses information, GDB lets you
     control what happens when the limit is reached, by means of the
     'stop-at-limit' option, described below.)

     If LIMIT is 'unlimited' or zero, GDB will never delete recorded
     instructions from the execution log.  The number of recorded
     instructions is limited only by the available memory.

'show record full insn-number-max'
     Show the limit of instructions to be recorded with the 'full'
     recording method.

'set record full stop-at-limit'
     Control the behavior of the 'full' recording method when the number
     of recorded instructions reaches the limit.  If ON (the default),
     GDB will stop when the limit is reached for the first time and ask
     you whether you want to stop the inferior or continue running it
     and recording the execution log.  If you decide to continue
     recording, each new recorded instruction will cause the oldest one
     to be deleted.

     If this option is OFF, GDB will automatically delete the oldest
     record to make room for each new one, without asking.

'show record full stop-at-limit'
     Show the current setting of 'stop-at-limit'.

'set record full memory-query'
     Control the behavior when GDB is unable to record memory changes
     caused by an instruction for the 'full' recording method.  If ON,
     GDB will query whether to stop the inferior in that case.

     If this option is OFF (the default), GDB will automatically ignore
     the effect of such instructions on memory.  Later, when GDB replays
     this execution log, it will mark the log of this instruction as not
     accessible, and it will not affect the replay results.

'show record full memory-query'
     Show the current setting of 'memory-query'.

     The 'btrace' record target does not trace data.  As a convenience,
     when replaying, GDB reads read-only memory off the live program
     directly, assuming that the addresses of the read-only areas don't
     change.  This for example makes it possible to disassemble code
     while replaying, but not to print variables.  In some cases, being
     able to inspect variables might be useful.  You can use the
     following command for that:

'set record btrace replay-memory-access'
     Control the behavior of the 'btrace' recording method when
     accessing memory during replay.  If 'read-only' (the default), GDB
     will only allow accesses to read-only memory.  If 'read-write', GDB
     will allow accesses to read-only and to read-write memory.  Beware
     that the accessed memory corresponds to the live target and not
     necessarily to the current replay position.

'show record btrace replay-memory-access'
     Show the current setting of 'replay-memory-access'.

'info record'
     Show various statistics about the recording depending on the
     recording method:

     'full'
          For the 'full' recording method, it shows the state of process
          record and its in-memory execution log buffer, including:

             * Whether in record mode or replay mode.
             * Lowest recorded instruction number (counting from when
               the current execution log started recording
               instructions).
             * Highest recorded instruction number.
             * Current instruction about to be replayed (if in replay
               mode).
             * Number of instructions contained in the execution log.
             * Maximum number of instructions that may be contained in
               the execution log.

     'btrace'
          For the 'btrace' recording method, it shows the number of
          instructions that have been recorded and the number of blocks
          of sequential control-flow that is formed by the recorded
          instructions.

'record delete'
     When record target runs in replay mode ("in the past"), delete the
     subsequent execution log and begin to record a new execution log
     starting from the current address.  This means you will abandon the
     previously recorded "future" and begin recording a new "future".

'record instruction-history'
     Disassembles instructions from the recorded execution log.  By
     default, ten instructions are disassembled.  This can be changed
     using the 'set record instruction-history-size' command.
     Instructions are printed in execution order.  There are several
     ways to specify what part of the execution log to disassemble:

     'record instruction-history INSN'
          Disassembles ten instructions starting from instruction number
          INSN.

     'record instruction-history INSN, +/-N'
          Disassembles N instructions around instruction number INSN.
          If N is preceded with '+', disassembles N instructions after
          instruction number INSN.  If N is preceded with '-',
          disassembles N instructions before instruction number INSN.

     'record instruction-history'
          Disassembles ten more instructions after the last disassembly.

     'record instruction-history -'
          Disassembles ten more instructions before the last
          disassembly.

     'record instruction-history BEGIN END'
          Disassembles instructions beginning with instruction number
          BEGIN until instruction number END.  The instruction number
          END is included.

     This command may not be available for all recording methods.

'set record instruction-history-size SIZE'
'set record instruction-history-size unlimited'
     Define how many instructions to disassemble in the 'record
     instruction-history' command.  The default value is 10.  A SIZE of
     'unlimited' means unlimited instructions.

'show record instruction-history-size'
     Show how many instructions to disassemble in the 'record
     instruction-history' command.

'record function-call-history'
     Prints the execution history at function granularity.  It prints
     one line for each sequence of instructions that belong to the same
     function giving the name of that function, the source lines for
     this instruction sequence (if the '/l' modifier is specified), and
     the instructions numbers that form the sequence (if the '/i'
     modifier is specified).  The function names are indented to reflect
     the call stack depth if the '/c' modifier is specified.  The '/l',
     '/i', and '/c' modifiers can be given together.

          (gdb) list 1, 10
          1   void foo (void)
          2   {
          3   }
          4
          5   void bar (void)
          6   {
          7     ...
          8     foo ();
          9     ...
          10  }
          (gdb) record function-call-history /ilc
          1  bar     inst 1,4     at foo.c:6,8
          2    foo   inst 5,10    at foo.c:2,3
          3  bar     inst 11,13   at foo.c:9,10

     By default, ten lines are printed.  This can be changed using the
     'set record function-call-history-size' command.  Functions are
     printed in execution order.  There are several ways to specify what
     to print:

     'record function-call-history FUNC'
          Prints ten functions starting from function number FUNC.

     'record function-call-history FUNC, +/-N'
          Prints N functions around function number FUNC.  If N is
          preceded with '+', prints N functions after function number
          FUNC.  If N is preceded with '-', prints N functions before
          function number FUNC.

     'record function-call-history'
          Prints ten more functions after the last ten-line print.

     'record function-call-history -'
          Prints ten more functions before the last ten-line print.

     'record function-call-history BEGIN END'
          Prints functions beginning with function number BEGIN until
          function number END.  The function number END is included.

     This command may not be available for all recording methods.

'set record function-call-history-size SIZE'
'set record function-call-history-size unlimited'
     Define how many lines to print in the 'record
     function-call-history' command.  The default value is 10.  A size
     of 'unlimited' means unlimited lines.

'show record function-call-history-size'
     Show how many lines to print in the 'record function-call-history'
     command.

8 Examining the Stack
*********************

When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is where
it stopped and how it got there.

   Each time your program performs a function call, information about
the call is generated.  That information includes the location of the
call in your program, the arguments of the call, and the local variables
of the function being called.  The information is saved in a block of
data called a "stack frame".  The stack frames are allocated in a region
of memory called the "call stack".

   When your program stops, the GDB commands for examining the stack
allow you to see all of this information.

   One of the stack frames is "selected" by GDB and many GDB commands
refer implicitly to the selected frame.  In particular, whenever you ask
GDB for the value of a variable in your program, the value is found in
the selected frame.  There are special GDB commands to select whichever
frame you are interested in.  *Note Selecting a Frame: Selection.

   When your program stops, GDB automatically selects the currently
executing frame and describes it briefly, similar to the 'frame' command
(*note Information about a Frame: Frame Info.).

* Menu:

* Frames::                      Stack frames
* Backtrace::                   Backtraces
* Frame Filter Management::     Managing frame filters
* Selection::                   Selecting a frame
* Frame Info::                  Information on a frame


File: gdb.info,  Node: Frames,  Next: Backtrace,  Up: Stack

8.1 Stack Frames
================

The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called "stack
frames", or "frames" for short; each frame is the data associated with
one call to one function.  The frame contains the arguments given to the
function, the function's local variables, and the address at which the
function is executing.

   When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of
the function 'main'.  This is called the "initial" frame or the
"outermost" frame.  Each time a function is called, a new frame is made.
Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation is
eliminated.  If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for
the same function.  The frame for the function in which execution is
actually occurring is called the "innermost" frame.  This is the most
recently created of all the stack frames that still exist.

   Inside your program, stack frames are identified by their addresses.
A stack frame consists of many bytes, each of which has its own address;
each kind of computer has a convention for choosing one byte whose
address serves as the address of the frame.  Usually this address is
kept in a register called the "frame pointer register" (*note $fp:
Registers.) while execution is going on in that frame.

   GDB assigns numbers to all existing stack frames, starting with zero
for the innermost frame, one for the frame that called it, and so on
upward.  These numbers do not really exist in your program; they are
assigned by GDB to give you a way of designating stack frames in GDB
commands.

   Some compilers provide a way to compile functions so that they
operate without stack frames.  (For example, the GCC option
     '-fomit-frame-pointer'
   generates functions without a frame.)  This is occasionally done with
heavily used library functions to save the frame setup time.  GDB has
limited facilities for dealing with these function invocations.  If the
innermost function invocation has no stack frame, GDB nevertheless
regards it as though it had a separate frame, which is numbered zero as
usual, allowing correct tracing of the function call chain.  However,
GDB has no provision for frameless functions elsewhere in the stack.

'frame [FRAMESPEC]'
     The 'frame' command allows you to move from one stack frame to
     another, and to print the stack frame you select.  The FRAMESPEC
     may be either the address of the frame or the stack frame number.
     Without an argument, 'frame' prints the current stack frame.

'select-frame'
     The 'select-frame' command allows you to move from one stack frame
     to another without printing the frame.  This is the silent version
     of 'frame'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Backtrace,  Next: Frame Filter Management,  Prev: Frames,  Up: Stack

8.2 Backtraces
==============

A backtrace is a summary of how your program got where it is.  It shows
one line per frame, for many frames, starting with the currently
executing frame (frame zero), followed by its caller (frame one), and on
up the stack.

'backtrace'
'bt'
     Print a backtrace of the entire stack: one line per frame for all
     frames in the stack.

     You can stop the backtrace at any time by typing the system
     interrupt character, normally 'Ctrl-c'.

'backtrace N'
'bt N'
     Similar, but print only the innermost N frames.

'backtrace -N'
'bt -N'
     Similar, but print only the outermost N frames.

'backtrace full'
'bt full'
'bt full N'
'bt full -N'
     Print the values of the local variables also.  As described above,
     N specifies the number of frames to print.

'backtrace no-filters'
'bt no-filters'
'bt no-filters N'
'bt no-filters -N'
'bt no-filters full'
'bt no-filters full N'
'bt no-filters full -N'
     Do not run Python frame filters on this backtrace.  *Note Frame
     Filter API::, for more information.  Additionally use *note disable
     frame-filter all:: to turn off all frame filters.  This is only
     relevant when GDB has been configured with 'Python' support.

   The names 'where' and 'info stack' (abbreviated 'info s') are
additional aliases for 'backtrace'.

   In a multi-threaded program, GDB by default shows the backtrace only
for the current thread.  To display the backtrace for several or all of
the threads, use the command 'thread apply' (*note thread apply:
Threads.).  For example, if you type 'thread apply all backtrace', GDB
will display the backtrace for all the threads; this is handy when you
debug a core dump of a multi-threaded program.

   Each line in the backtrace shows the frame number and the function
name.  The program counter value is also shown--unless you use 'set
print address off'.  The backtrace also shows the source file name and
line number, as well as the arguments to the function.  The program
counter value is omitted if it is at the beginning of the code for that
line number.

   Here is an example of a backtrace.  It was made with the command 'bt
3', so it shows the innermost three frames.

     #0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
         at builtin.c:993
     #1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=0x2b600, data=...) at macro.c:242
     #2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=177664, td=0xf7fffb08)
         at macro.c:71
     (More stack frames follow...)

The display for frame zero does not begin with a program counter value,
indicating that your program has stopped at the beginning of the code
for line '993' of 'builtin.c'.

The value of parameter 'data' in frame 1 has been replaced by '...'.  By
default, GDB prints the value of a parameter only if it is a scalar
(integer, pointer, enumeration, etc).  See command 'set print
frame-arguments' in *note Print Settings:: for more details on how to
configure the way function parameter values are printed.

   If your program was compiled with optimizations, some compilers will
optimize away arguments passed to functions if those arguments are never
used after the call.  Such optimizations generate code that passes
arguments through registers, but doesn't store those arguments in the
stack frame.  GDB has no way of displaying such arguments in stack
frames other than the innermost one.  Here's what such a backtrace might
look like:

     #0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
         at builtin.c:993
     #1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=<optimized out>) at macro.c:242
     #2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=<optimized out>, td=0xf7fffb08)
         at macro.c:71
     (More stack frames follow...)

The values of arguments that were not saved in their stack frames are
shown as '<optimized out>'.

   If you need to display the values of such optimized-out arguments,
either deduce that from other variables whose values depend on the one
you are interested in, or recompile without optimizations.

   Most programs have a standard user entry point--a place where system
libraries and startup code transition into user code.  For C this is
'main'(1).  When GDB finds the entry function in a backtrace it will
terminate the backtrace, to avoid tracing into highly system-specific
(and generally uninteresting) code.

   If you need to examine the startup code, or limit the number of
levels in a backtrace, you can change this behavior:

'set backtrace past-main'
'set backtrace past-main on'
     Backtraces will continue past the user entry point.

'set backtrace past-main off'
     Backtraces will stop when they encounter the user entry point.
     This is the default.

'show backtrace past-main'
     Display the current user entry point backtrace policy.

'set backtrace past-entry'
'set backtrace past-entry on'
     Backtraces will continue past the internal entry point of an
     application.  This entry point is encoded by the linker when the
     application is built, and is likely before the user entry point
     'main' (or equivalent) is called.

'set backtrace past-entry off'
     Backtraces will stop when they encounter the internal entry point
     of an application.  This is the default.

'show backtrace past-entry'
     Display the current internal entry point backtrace policy.

'set backtrace limit N'
'set backtrace limit 0'
'set backtrace limit unlimited'
     Limit the backtrace to N levels.  A value of 'unlimited' or zero
     means unlimited levels.

'show backtrace limit'
     Display the current limit on backtrace levels.

   You can control how file names are displayed.

'set filename-display'
'set filename-display relative'
     Display file names relative to the compilation directory.  This is
     the default.

'set filename-display basename'
     Display only basename of a filename.

'set filename-display absolute'
     Display an absolute filename.

'show filename-display'
     Show the current way to display filenames.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that embedded programs (the so-called "free-standing"
environment) are not required to have a 'main' function as the entry
point.  They could even have multiple entry points.

8.3 Management of Frame Filters.
================================

Frame filters are Python based utilities to manage and decorate the
output of frames.  *Note Frame Filter API::, for further information.

   Managing frame filters is performed by several commands available
within GDB, detailed here.

'info frame-filter'
     Print a list of installed frame filters from all dictionaries,
     showing their name, priority and enabled status.

'disable frame-filter FILTER-DICTIONARY FILTER-NAME'
     Disable a frame filter in the dictionary matching FILTER-DICTIONARY
     and FILTER-NAME.  The FILTER-DICTIONARY may be 'all', 'global',
     'progspace', or the name of the object file where the frame filter
     dictionary resides.  When 'all' is specified, all frame filters
     across all dictionaries are disabled.  The FILTER-NAME is the name
     of the frame filter and is used when 'all' is not the option for
     FILTER-DICTIONARY.  A disabled frame-filter is not deleted, it may
     be enabled again later.

'enable frame-filter FILTER-DICTIONARY FILTER-NAME'
     Enable a frame filter in the dictionary matching FILTER-DICTIONARY
     and FILTER-NAME.  The FILTER-DICTIONARY may be 'all', 'global',
     'progspace' or the name of the object file where the frame filter
     dictionary resides.  When 'all' is specified, all frame filters
     across all dictionaries are enabled.  The FILTER-NAME is the name
     of the frame filter and is used when 'all' is not the option for
     FILTER-DICTIONARY.

     Example:

          (gdb) info frame-filter

          global frame-filters:
            Priority  Enabled  Name
            1000      No       PrimaryFunctionFilter
            100       Yes      Reverse

          progspace /build/test frame-filters:
            Priority  Enabled  Name
            100       Yes      ProgspaceFilter

            Priority  Enabled  Name
            999       No       BuildProgramFilter

'set frame-filter priority FILTER-DICTIONARY FILTER-NAME PRIORITY'
     Set the PRIORITY of a frame filter in the dictionary matching
     FILTER-DICTIONARY, and the frame filter name matching FILTER-NAME.
     The FILTER-DICTIONARY may be 'global', 'progspace' or the name of
     the object file where the frame filter dictionary resides.  The
     PRIORITY is an integer.

'show frame-filter priority FILTER-DICTIONARY FILTER-NAME'
     Show the PRIORITY of a frame filter in the dictionary matching
     FILTER-DICTIONARY, and the frame filter name matching FILTER-NAME.
     The FILTER-DICTIONARY may be 'global', 'progspace' or the name of
     the object file where the frame filter dictionary resides.

     Example:

          (gdb) info frame-filter

          global frame-filters:
            Priority  Enabled  Name
            1000      Yes      PrimaryFunctionFilter

          (gdb) set frame-filter priority global Reverse 50
          (gdb) info frame-filter

          global frame-filters:
            Priority  Enabled  Name
            1000      Yes      PrimaryFunctionFilter
            50        Yes      Reverse

          progspace /build/test frame-filters:
            Priority  Enabled  Name
            100       Yes      ProgspaceFilter

          objfile /build/test frame-filters:

8.4 Selecting a Frame
=====================

Most commands for examining the stack and other data in your program
work on whichever stack frame is selected at the moment.  Here are the
commands for selecting a stack frame; all of them finish by printing a
brief description of the stack frame just selected.

'frame N'
'f N'
     Select frame number N.  Recall that frame zero is the innermost
     (currently executing) frame, frame one is the frame that called the
     innermost one, and so on.  The highest-numbered frame is the one
     for 'main'.

'frame ADDR'
'f ADDR'
     Select the frame at address ADDR.  This is useful mainly if the
     chaining of stack frames has been damaged by a bug, making it
     impossible for GDB to assign numbers properly to all frames.  In
     addition, this can be useful when your program has multiple stacks
     and switches between them.

     On the SPARC architecture, 'frame' needs two addresses to select an
     arbitrary frame: a frame pointer and a stack pointer.

     On the MIPS and Alpha architecture, it needs two addresses: a stack
     pointer and a program counter.

     On the 29k architecture, it needs three addresses: a register stack
     pointer, a program counter, and a memory stack pointer.

'up N'
     Move N frames up the stack; N defaults to 1.  For positive numbers
     N, this advances toward the outermost frame, to higher frame
     numbers, to frames that have existed longer.

'down N'
     Move N frames down the stack; N defaults to 1.  For positive
     numbers N, this advances toward the innermost frame, to lower frame
     numbers, to frames that were created more recently.  You may
     abbreviate 'down' as 'do'.

   All of these commands end by printing two lines of output describing
the frame.  The first line shows the frame number, the function name,
the arguments, and the source file and line number of execution in that
frame.  The second line shows the text of that source line.

   For example:

     (gdb) up
     #1  0x22f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0xf7fffbf4, env=0xf7fffbfc)
         at env.c:10
     10              read_input_file (argv[i]);

   After such a printout, the 'list' command with no arguments prints
ten lines centered on the point of execution in the frame.  You can also
edit the program at the point of execution with your favorite editing
program by typing 'edit'.  *Note Printing Source Lines: List, for
details.

'up-silently N'
'down-silently N'
     These two commands are variants of 'up' and 'down', respectively;
     they differ in that they do their work silently, without causing
     display of the new frame.  They are intended primarily for use in
     GDB command scripts, where the output might be unnecessary and
     distracting.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Frame Info,  Prev: Selection,  Up: Stack

8.5 Information About a Frame
=============================

There are several other commands to print information about the selected
stack frame.

'frame'
'f'
     When used without any argument, this command does not change which
     frame is selected, but prints a brief description of the currently
     selected stack frame.  It can be abbreviated 'f'.  With an
     argument, this command is used to select a stack frame.  *Note
     Selecting a Frame: Selection.

'info frame'
'info f'
     This command prints a verbose description of the selected stack
     frame, including:

        * the address of the frame
        * the address of the next frame down (called by this frame)
        * the address of the next frame up (caller of this frame)
        * the language in which the source code corresponding to this
          frame is written
        * the address of the frame's arguments
        * the address of the frame's local variables
        * the program counter saved in it (the address of execution in
          the caller frame)
        * which registers were saved in the frame

     The verbose description is useful when something has gone wrong
     that has made the stack format fail to fit the usual conventions.

'info frame ADDR'
'info f ADDR'
     Print a verbose description of the frame at address ADDR, without
     selecting that frame.  The selected frame remains unchanged by this
     command.  This requires the same kind of address (more than one for
     some architectures) that you specify in the 'frame' command.  *Note
     Selecting a Frame: Selection.

'info args'
     Print the arguments of the selected frame, each on a separate line.

'info locals'
     Print the local variables of the selected frame, each on a separate
     line.  These are all variables (declared either static or
     automatic) accessible at the point of execution of the selected
     frame.

9 Examining Source Files
************************

GDB can print parts of your program's source, since the debugging
information recorded in the program tells GDB what source files were
used to build it.  When your program stops, GDB spontaneously prints the
line where it stopped.  Likewise, when you select a stack frame (*note
Selecting a Frame: Selection.), GDB prints the line where execution in
that frame has stopped.  You can print other portions of source files by
explicit command.

   If you use GDB through its GNU Emacs interface, you may prefer to use
Emacs facilities to view source; see *note Using GDB under GNU Emacs:
Emacs.

9.1 Printing Source Lines
=========================

To print lines from a source file, use the 'list' command (abbreviated
'l').  By default, ten lines are printed.  There are several ways to
specify what part of the file you want to print; see *note Specify
Location::, for the full list.

   Here are the forms of the 'list' command most commonly used:

'list LINENUM'
     Print lines centered around line number LINENUM in the current
     source file.

'list FUNCTION'
     Print lines centered around the beginning of function FUNCTION.

'list'
     Print more lines.  If the last lines printed were printed with a
     'list' command, this prints lines following the last lines printed;
     however, if the last line printed was a solitary line printed as
     part of displaying a stack frame (*note Examining the Stack:
     Stack.), this prints lines centered around that line.

'list -'
     Print lines just before the lines last printed.

   By default, GDB prints ten source lines with any of these forms of
the 'list' command.  You can change this using 'set listsize':

'set listsize COUNT'
'set listsize unlimited'
     Make the 'list' command display COUNT source lines (unless the
     'list' argument explicitly specifies some other number).  Setting
     COUNT to 'unlimited' or 0 means there's no limit.

'show listsize'
     Display the number of lines that 'list' prints.

   Repeating a 'list' command with <RET> discards the argument, so it is
equivalent to typing just 'list'.  This is more useful than listing the
same lines again.  An exception is made for an argument of '-'; that
argument is preserved in repetition so that each repetition moves up in
the source file.

   In general, the 'list' command expects you to supply zero, one or two
"linespecs".  Linespecs specify source lines; there are several ways of
writing them (*note Specify Location::), but the effect is always to
specify some source line.

   Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for 'list':

'list LINESPEC'
     Print lines centered around the line specified by LINESPEC.

'list FIRST,LAST'
     Print lines from FIRST to LAST.  Both arguments are linespecs.
     When a 'list' command has two linespecs, and the source file of the
     second linespec is omitted, this refers to the same source file as
     the first linespec.

'list ,LAST'
     Print lines ending with LAST.

'list FIRST,'
     Print lines starting with FIRST.

'list +'
     Print lines just after the lines last printed.

'list -'
     Print lines just before the lines last printed.

'list'
     As described in the preceding table.

9.2 Specifying a Location
=========================

Several GDB commands accept arguments that specify a location of your
program's code.  Since GDB is a source-level debugger, a location
usually specifies some line in the source code; for that reason,
locations are also known as "linespecs".

   Here are all the different ways of specifying a code location that
GDB understands:

'LINENUM'
     Specifies the line number LINENUM of the current source file.

'-OFFSET'
'+OFFSET'
     Specifies the line OFFSET lines before or after the "current line".
     For the 'list' command, the current line is the last one printed;
     for the breakpoint commands, this is the line at which execution
     stopped in the currently selected "stack frame" (*note Frames:
     Frames, for a description of stack frames.)  When used as the
     second of the two linespecs in a 'list' command, this specifies the
     line OFFSET lines up or down from the first linespec.

'FILENAME:LINENUM'
     Specifies the line LINENUM in the source file FILENAME.  If
     FILENAME is a relative file name, then it will match any source
     file name with the same trailing components.  For example, if
     FILENAME is 'gcc/expr.c', then it will match source file name of
     '/build/trunk/gcc/expr.c', but not '/build/trunk/libcpp/expr.c' or
     '/build/trunk/gcc/x-expr.c'.

'FUNCTION'
     Specifies the line that begins the body of the function FUNCTION.
     For example, in C, this is the line with the open brace.

'FUNCTION:LABEL'
     Specifies the line where LABEL appears in FUNCTION.

'FILENAME:FUNCTION'
     Specifies the line that begins the body of the function FUNCTION in
     the file FILENAME.  You only need the file name with a function
     name to avoid ambiguity when there are identically named functions
     in different source files.

'LABEL'
     Specifies the line at which the label named LABEL appears.  GDB
     searches for the label in the function corresponding to the
     currently selected stack frame.  If there is no current selected
     stack frame (for instance, if the inferior is not running), then
     GDB will not search for a label.

'*ADDRESS'
     Specifies the program address ADDRESS.  For line-oriented commands,
     such as 'list' and 'edit', this specifies a source line that
     contains ADDRESS.  For 'break' and other breakpoint oriented
     commands, this can be used to set breakpoints in parts of your
     program which do not have debugging information or source files.

     Here ADDRESS may be any expression valid in the current working
     language (*note working language: Languages.) that specifies a code
     address.  In addition, as a convenience, GDB extends the semantics
     of expressions used in locations to cover the situations that
     frequently happen during debugging.  Here are the various forms of
     ADDRESS:

     'EXPRESSION'
          Any expression valid in the current working language.

     'FUNCADDR'
          An address of a function or procedure derived from its name.
          In C, C++, Java, Objective-C, Fortran, minimal, and assembly,
          this is simply the function's name FUNCTION (and actually a
          special case of a valid expression).  In Pascal and Modula-2,
          this is '&FUNCTION'.  In Ada, this is 'FUNCTION'Address'
          (although the Pascal form also works).

          This form specifies the address of the function's first
          instruction, before the stack frame and arguments have been
          set up.

     ''FILENAME'::FUNCADDR'
          Like FUNCADDR above, but also specifies the name of the source
          file explicitly.  This is useful if the name of the function
          does not specify the function unambiguously, e.g., if there
          are several functions with identical names in different source
          files.

'-pstap|-probe-stap [OBJFILE:[PROVIDER:]]NAME'
     The GNU/Linux tool 'SystemTap' provides a way for applications to
     embed static probes.  *Note Static Probe Points::, for more
     information on finding and using static probes.  This form of
     linespec specifies the location of such a static probe.

     If OBJFILE is given, only probes coming from that shared library or
     executable matching OBJFILE as a regular expression are considered.
     If PROVIDER is given, then only probes from that provider are
     considered.  If several probes match the spec, GDB will insert a
     breakpoint at each one of those probes.

9.3 Editing Source Files
========================

To edit the lines in a source file, use the 'edit' command.  The editing
program of your choice is invoked with the current line set to the
active line in the program.  Alternatively, there are several ways to
specify what part of the file you want to print if you want to see other
parts of the program:

'edit LOCATION'
     Edit the source file specified by 'location'.  Editing starts at
     that LOCATION, e.g., at the specified source line of the specified
     file.  *Note Specify Location::, for all the possible forms of the
     LOCATION argument; here are the forms of the 'edit' command most
     commonly used:

     'edit NUMBER'
          Edit the current source file with NUMBER as the active line
          number.

     'edit FUNCTION'
          Edit the file containing FUNCTION at the beginning of its
          definition.

9.3.1 Choosing your Editor
--------------------------

You can customize GDB to use any editor you want (1).  By default, it is
'/bin/ex', but you can change this by setting the environment variable
'EDITOR' before using GDB.  For example, to configure GDB to use the
'vi' editor, you could use these commands with the 'sh' shell:
     EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi
     export EDITOR
     gdb ...
   or in the 'csh' shell,
     setenv EDITOR /usr/bin/vi
     gdb ...

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The only restriction is that your editor (say 'ex'), recognizes
the following command-line syntax:
     ex +NUMBER file
   The optional numeric value +NUMBER specifies the number of the line
in the file where to start editing.

9.4 Searching Source Files
==========================

There are two commands for searching through the current source file for
a regular expression.

'forward-search REGEXP'
'search REGEXP'
     The command 'forward-search REGEXP' checks each line, starting with
     the one following the last line listed, for a match for REGEXP.  It
     lists the line that is found.  You can use the synonym 'search
     REGEXP' or abbreviate the command name as 'fo'.

'reverse-search REGEXP'
     The command 'reverse-search REGEXP' checks each line, starting with
     the one before the last line listed and going backward, for a match
     for REGEXP.  It lists the line that is found.  You can abbreviate
     this command as 'rev'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Source Path,  Next: Machine Code,  Prev: Search,  Up: Source

9.5 Specifying Source Directories
=================================

Executable programs sometimes do not record the directories of the
source files from which they were compiled, just the names.  Even when
they do, the directories could be moved between the compilation and your
debugging session.  GDB has a list of directories to search for source
files; this is called the "source path".  Each time GDB wants a source
file, it tries all the directories in the list, in the order they are
present in the list, until it finds a file with the desired name.

   For example, suppose an executable references the file
'/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c', and our source path is '/mnt/cross'.  The
file is first looked up literally; if this fails,
'/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c' is tried; if this fails,
'/mnt/cross/foo.c' is opened; if this fails, an error message is
printed.  GDB does not look up the parts of the source file name, such
as '/mnt/cross/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c'.  Likewise, the subdirectories of
the source path are not searched: if the source path is '/mnt/cross',
and the binary refers to 'foo.c', GDB would not find it under
'/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib'.

   Plain file names, relative file names with leading directories, file
names containing dots, etc. are all treated as described above; for
instance, if the source path is '/mnt/cross', and the source file is
recorded as '../lib/foo.c', GDB would first try '../lib/foo.c', then
'/mnt/cross/../lib/foo.c', and after that--'/mnt/cross/foo.c'.

   Note that the executable search path is _not_ used to locate the
source files.

   Whenever you reset or rearrange the source path, GDB clears out any
information it has cached about where source files are found and where
each line is in the file.

   When you start GDB, its source path includes only 'cdir' and 'cwd',
in that order.  To add other directories, use the 'directory' command.

   The search path is used to find both program source files and GDB
script files (read using the '-command' option and 'source' command).

   In addition to the source path, GDB provides a set of commands that
manage a list of source path substitution rules.  A "substitution rule"
specifies how to rewrite source directories stored in the program's
debug information in case the sources were moved to a different
directory between compilation and debugging.  A rule is made of two
strings, the first specifying what needs to be rewritten in the path,
and the second specifying how it should be rewritten.  In *note set
substitute-path::, we name these two parts FROM and TO respectively.
GDB does a simple string replacement of FROM with TO at the start of the
directory part of the source file name, and uses that result instead of
the original file name to look up the sources.

   Using the previous example, suppose the 'foo-1.0' tree has been moved
from '/usr/src' to '/mnt/cross', then you can tell GDB to replace
'/usr/src' in all source path names with '/mnt/cross'.  The first lookup
will then be '/mnt/cross/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c' in place of the original
location of '/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c'.  To define a source path
substitution rule, use the 'set substitute-path' command (*note set
substitute-path::).

   To avoid unexpected substitution results, a rule is applied only if
the FROM part of the directory name ends at a directory separator.  For
instance, a rule substituting '/usr/source' into '/mnt/cross' will be
applied to '/usr/source/foo-1.0' but not to '/usr/sourceware/foo-2.0'.
And because the substitution is applied only at the beginning of the
directory name, this rule will not be applied to
'/root/usr/source/baz.c' either.

   In many cases, you can achieve the same result using the 'directory'
command.  However, 'set substitute-path' can be more efficient in the
case where the sources are organized in a complex tree with multiple
subdirectories.  With the 'directory' command, you need to add each
subdirectory of your project.  If you moved the entire tree while
preserving its internal organization, then 'set substitute-path' allows
you to direct the debugger to all the sources with one single command.

   'set substitute-path' is also more than just a shortcut command.  The
source path is only used if the file at the original location no longer
exists.  On the other hand, 'set substitute-path' modifies the debugger
behavior to look at the rewritten location instead.  So, if for any
reason a source file that is not relevant to your executable is located
at the original location, a substitution rule is the only method
available to point GDB at the new location.

   You can configure a default source path substitution rule by
configuring GDB with the '--with-relocated-sources=DIR' option.  The DIR
should be the name of a directory under GDB's configured prefix (set
with '--prefix' or '--exec-prefix'), and directory names in debug
information under DIR will be adjusted automatically if the installed
GDB is moved to a new location.  This is useful if GDB, libraries or
executables with debug information and corresponding source code are
being moved together.

'directory DIRNAME ...'
'dir DIRNAME ...'
     Add directory DIRNAME to the front of the source path.  Several
     directory names may be given to this command, separated by ':' (';'
     on MS-DOS and MS-Windows, where ':' usually appears as part of
     absolute file names) or whitespace.  You may specify a directory
     that is already in the source path; this moves it forward, so GDB
     searches it sooner.

     You can use the string '$cdir' to refer to the compilation
     directory (if one is recorded), and '$cwd' to refer to the current
     working directory.  '$cwd' is not the same as '.'--the former
     tracks the current working directory as it changes during your GDB
     session, while the latter is immediately expanded to the current
     directory at the time you add an entry to the source path.

'directory'
     Reset the source path to its default value ('$cdir:$cwd' on Unix
     systems).  This requires confirmation.

'set directories PATH-LIST'
     Set the source path to PATH-LIST.  '$cdir:$cwd' are added if
     missing.

'show directories'
     Print the source path: show which directories it contains.

'set substitute-path FROM TO'
     Define a source path substitution rule, and add it at the end of
     the current list of existing substitution rules.  If a rule with
     the same FROM was already defined, then the old rule is also
     deleted.

     For example, if the file '/foo/bar/baz.c' was moved to
     '/mnt/cross/baz.c', then the command

          (gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src /mnt/cross

     will tell GDB to replace '/usr/src' with '/mnt/cross', which will
     allow GDB to find the file 'baz.c' even though it was moved.

     In the case when more than one substitution rule have been defined,
     the rules are evaluated one by one in the order where they have
     been defined.  The first one matching, if any, is selected to
     perform the substitution.

     For instance, if we had entered the following commands:

          (gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/include /mnt/include
          (gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src /mnt/src

     GDB would then rewrite '/usr/src/include/defs.h' into
     '/mnt/include/defs.h' by using the first rule.  However, it would
     use the second rule to rewrite '/usr/src/lib/foo.c' into
     '/mnt/src/lib/foo.c'.

'unset substitute-path [path]'
     If a path is specified, search the current list of substitution
     rules for a rule that would rewrite that path.  Delete that rule if
     found.  A warning is emitted by the debugger if no rule could be
     found.

     If no path is specified, then all substitution rules are deleted.

'show substitute-path [path]'
     If a path is specified, then print the source path substitution
     rule which would rewrite that path, if any.

     If no path is specified, then print all existing source path
     substitution rules.

   If your source path is cluttered with directories that are no longer
of interest, GDB may sometimes cause confusion by finding the wrong
versions of source.  You can correct the situation as follows:

  1. Use 'directory' with no argument to reset the source path to its
     default value.

  2. Use 'directory' with suitable arguments to reinstall the
     directories you want in the source path.  You can add all the
     directories in one command.

9.6 Source and Machine Code
===========================

You can use the command 'info line' to map source lines to program
addresses (and vice versa), and the command 'disassemble' to display a
range of addresses as machine instructions.  You can use the command
'set disassemble-next-line' to set whether to disassemble next source
line when execution stops.  When run under GNU Emacs mode, the 'info
line' command causes the arrow to point to the line specified.  Also,
'info line' prints addresses in symbolic form as well as hex.

'info line LINESPEC'
     Print the starting and ending addresses of the compiled code for
     source line LINESPEC.  You can specify source lines in any of the
     ways documented in *note Specify Location::.

   For example, we can use 'info line' to discover the location of the
object code for the first line of function 'm4_changequote':

     (gdb) info line m4_changequote
     Line 895 of "builtin.c" starts at pc 0x634c and ends at 0x6350.

We can also inquire (using '*ADDR' as the form for LINESPEC) what source
line covers a particular address:
     (gdb) info line *0x63ff
     Line 926 of "builtin.c" starts at pc 0x63e4 and ends at 0x6404.

   After 'info line', the default address for the 'x' command is changed
to the starting address of the line, so that 'x/i' is sufficient to
begin examining the machine code (*note Examining Memory: Memory.).
Also, this address is saved as the value of the convenience variable
'$_' (*note Convenience Variables: Convenience Vars.).

'disassemble'
'disassemble /m'
'disassemble /r'
     This specialized command dumps a range of memory as machine
     instructions.  It can also print mixed source+disassembly by
     specifying the '/m' modifier and print the raw instructions in hex
     as well as in symbolic form by specifying the '/r'.  The default
     memory range is the function surrounding the program counter of the
     selected frame.  A single argument to this command is a program
     counter value; GDB dumps the function surrounding this value.  When
     two arguments are given, they should be separated by a comma,
     possibly surrounded by whitespace.  The arguments specify a range
     of addresses to dump, in one of two forms:

     'START,END'
          the addresses from START (inclusive) to END (exclusive)
     'START,+LENGTH'
          the addresses from START (inclusive) to 'START+LENGTH'
          (exclusive).

     When 2 arguments are specified, the name of the function is also
     printed (since there could be several functions in the given
     range).

     The argument(s) can be any expression yielding a numeric value,
     such as '0x32c4', '&main+10' or '$pc - 8'.

     If the range of memory being disassembled contains current program
     counter, the instruction at that location is shown with a '=>'
     marker.

   The following example shows the disassembly of a range of addresses
of HP PA-RISC 2.0 code:

     (gdb) disas 0x32c4, 0x32e4
     Dump of assembler code from 0x32c4 to 0x32e4:
        0x32c4 <main+204>:      addil 0,dp
        0x32c8 <main+208>:      ldw 0x22c(sr0,r1),r26
        0x32cc <main+212>:      ldil 0x3000,r31
        0x32d0 <main+216>:      ble 0x3f8(sr4,r31)
        0x32d4 <main+220>:      ldo 0(r31),rp
        0x32d8 <main+224>:      addil -0x800,dp
        0x32dc <main+228>:      ldo 0x588(r1),r26
        0x32e0 <main+232>:      ldil 0x3000,r31
     End of assembler dump.

   Here is an example showing mixed source+assembly for Intel x86, when
the program is stopped just after function prologue:

     (gdb) disas /m main
     Dump of assembler code for function main:
     5       {
        0x08048330 <+0>:    push   %ebp
        0x08048331 <+1>:    mov    %esp,%ebp
        0x08048333 <+3>:    sub    $0x8,%esp
        0x08048336 <+6>:    and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
        0x08048339 <+9>:    sub    $0x10,%esp

     6         printf ("Hello.\n");
     => 0x0804833c <+12>:   movl   $0x8048440,(%esp)
        0x08048343 <+19>:   call   0x8048284 <puts@plt>

     7         return 0;
     8       }
        0x08048348 <+24>:   mov    $0x0,%eax
        0x0804834d <+29>:   leave
        0x0804834e <+30>:   ret

     End of assembler dump.

   Here is another example showing raw instructions in hex for AMD
x86-64,

     (gdb) disas /r 0x400281,+10
     Dump of assembler code from 0x400281 to 0x40028b:
        0x0000000000400281:  38 36  cmp    %dh,(%rsi)
        0x0000000000400283:  2d 36 34 2e 73 sub    $0x732e3436,%eax
        0x0000000000400288:  6f     outsl  %ds:(%rsi),(%dx)
        0x0000000000400289:  2e 32 00       xor    %cs:(%rax),%al
     End of assembler dump.

   Addresses cannot be specified as a linespec (*note Specify
Location::).  So, for example, if you want to disassemble function 'bar'
in file 'foo.c', you must type 'disassemble 'foo.c'::bar' and not
'disassemble foo.c:bar'.

   Some architectures have more than one commonly-used set of
instruction mnemonics or other syntax.

   For programs that were dynamically linked and use shared libraries,
instructions that call functions or branch to locations in the shared
libraries might show a seemingly bogus location--it's actually a
location of the relocation table.  On some architectures, GDB might be
able to resolve these to actual function names.

'set disassembly-flavor INSTRUCTION-SET'
     Select the instruction set to use when disassembling the program
     via the 'disassemble' or 'x/i' commands.

     Currently this command is only defined for the Intel x86 family.
     You can set INSTRUCTION-SET to either 'intel' or 'att'.  The
     default is 'att', the AT&T flavor used by default by Unix
     assemblers for x86-based targets.

'show disassembly-flavor'
     Show the current setting of the disassembly flavor.

'set disassemble-next-line'
'show disassemble-next-line'
     Control whether or not GDB will disassemble the next source line or
     instruction when execution stops.  If ON, GDB will display
     disassembly of the next source line when execution of the program
     being debugged stops.  This is _in addition_ to displaying the
     source line itself, which GDB always does if possible.  If the next
     source line cannot be displayed for some reason (e.g., if GDB
     cannot find the source file, or there's no line info in the debug
     info), GDB will display disassembly of the next _instruction_
     instead of showing the next source line.  If AUTO, GDB will display
     disassembly of next instruction only if the source line cannot be
     displayed.  This setting causes GDB to display some feedback when
     you step through a function with no line info or whose source file
     is unavailable.  The default is OFF, which means never display the
     disassembly of the next line or instruction.

10 Examining Data
*****************

The usual way to examine data in your program is with the 'print'
command (abbreviated 'p'), or its synonym 'inspect'.  It evaluates and
prints the value of an expression of the language your program is
written in (*note Using GDB with Different Languages: Languages.).  It
may also print the expression using a Python-based pretty-printer (*note
Pretty Printing::).

'print EXPR'
'print /F EXPR'
     EXPR is an expression (in the source language).  By default the
     value of EXPR is printed in a format appropriate to its data type;
     you can choose a different format by specifying '/F', where F is a
     letter specifying the format; see *note Output Formats: Output
     Formats.

'print'
'print /F'
     If you omit EXPR, GDB displays the last value again (from the
     "value history"; *note Value History: Value History.).  This allows
     you to conveniently inspect the same value in an alternative
     format.

   A more low-level way of examining data is with the 'x' command.  It
examines data in memory at a specified address and prints it in a
specified format.  *Note Examining Memory: Memory.

   If you are interested in information about types, or about how the
fields of a struct or a class are declared, use the 'ptype EXP' command
rather than 'print'.  *Note Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols.

   Another way of examining values of expressions and type information
is through the Python extension command 'explore' (available only if the
GDB build is configured with '--with-python').  It offers an interactive
way to start at the highest level (or, the most abstract level) of the
data type of an expression (or, the data type itself) and explore all
the way down to leaf scalar values/fields embedded in the higher level
data types.

'explore ARG'
     ARG is either an expression (in the source language), or a type
     visible in the current context of the program being debugged.

   The working of the 'explore' command can be illustrated with an
example.  If a data type 'struct ComplexStruct' is defined in your C
program as

     struct SimpleStruct
     {
       int i;
       double d;
     };

     struct ComplexStruct
     {
       struct SimpleStruct *ss_p;
       int arr[10];
     };

followed by variable declarations as

     struct SimpleStruct ss = { 10, 1.11 };
     struct ComplexStruct cs = { &ss, { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 } };

then, the value of the variable 'cs' can be explored using the 'explore'
command as follows.

     (gdb) explore cs
     The value of `cs' is a struct/class of type `struct ComplexStruct' with
     the following fields:

       ss_p = <Enter 0 to explore this field of type `struct SimpleStruct *'>
        arr = <Enter 1 to explore this field of type `int [10]'>

     Enter the field number of choice:

Since the fields of 'cs' are not scalar values, you are being prompted
to chose the field you want to explore.  Let's say you choose the field
'ss_p' by entering '0'.  Then, since this field is a pointer, you will
be asked if it is pointing to a single value.  From the declaration of
'cs' above, it is indeed pointing to a single value, hence you enter
'y'.  If you enter 'n', then you will be asked if it were pointing to an
array of values, in which case this field will be explored as if it were
an array.

     `cs.ss_p' is a pointer to a value of type `struct SimpleStruct'
     Continue exploring it as a pointer to a single value [y/n]: y
     The value of `*(cs.ss_p)' is a struct/class of type `struct
     SimpleStruct' with the following fields:

       i = 10 .. (Value of type `int')
       d = 1.1100000000000001 .. (Value of type `double')

     Press enter to return to parent value:

If the field 'arr' of 'cs' was chosen for exploration by entering '1'
earlier, then since it is as array, you will be prompted to enter the
index of the element in the array that you want to explore.

     `cs.arr' is an array of `int'.
     Enter the index of the element you want to explore in `cs.arr': 5

     `(cs.arr)[5]' is a scalar value of type `int'.

     (cs.arr)[5] = 4

     Press enter to return to parent value:

   In general, at any stage of exploration, you can go deeper towards
the leaf values by responding to the prompts appropriately, or hit the
return key to return to the enclosing data structure (the higher level
data structure).

   Similar to exploring values, you can use the 'explore' command to
explore types.  Instead of specifying a value (which is typically a
variable name or an expression valid in the current context of the
program being debugged), you specify a type name.  If you consider the
same example as above, your can explore the type 'struct ComplexStruct'
by passing the argument 'struct ComplexStruct' to the 'explore' command.

     (gdb) explore struct ComplexStruct

By responding to the prompts appropriately in the subsequent interactive
session, you can explore the type 'struct ComplexStruct' in a manner
similar to how the value 'cs' was explored in the above example.

   The 'explore' command also has two sub-commands, 'explore value' and
'explore type'.  The former sub-command is a way to explicitly specify
that value exploration of the argument is being invoked, while the
latter is a way to explicitly specify that type exploration of the
argument is being invoked.

'explore value EXPR'
     This sub-command of 'explore' explores the value of the expression
     EXPR (if EXPR is an expression valid in the current context of the
     program being debugged).  The behavior of this command is identical
     to that of the behavior of the 'explore' command being passed the
     argument EXPR.

'explore type ARG'
     This sub-command of 'explore' explores the type of ARG (if ARG is a
     type visible in the current context of program being debugged), or
     the type of the value/expression ARG (if ARG is an expression valid
     in the current context of the program being debugged).  If ARG is a
     type, then the behavior of this command is identical to that of the
     'explore' command being passed the argument ARG.  If ARG is an
     expression, then the behavior of this command will be identical to
     that of the 'explore' command being passed the type of ARG as the
     argument.

10.1 Expressions
================

'print' and many other GDB commands accept an expression and compute its
value.  Any kind of constant, variable or operator defined by the
programming language you are using is valid in an expression in GDB.
This includes conditional expressions, function calls, casts, and string
constants.  It also includes preprocessor macros, if you compiled your
program to include this information; see *note Compilation::.

   GDB supports array constants in expressions input by the user.  The
syntax is {ELEMENT, ELEMENT...}.  For example, you can use the command
'print {1, 2, 3}' to create an array of three integers.  If you pass an
array to a function or assign it to a program variable, GDB copies the
array to memory that is 'malloc'ed in the target program.

   Because C is so widespread, most of the expressions shown in examples
in this manual are in C. *Note Using GDB with Different Languages:
Languages, for information on how to use expressions in other languages.

   In this section, we discuss operators that you can use in GDB
expressions regardless of your programming language.

   Casts are supported in all languages, not just in C, because it is so
useful to cast a number into a pointer in order to examine a structure
at that address in memory.

   GDB supports these operators, in addition to those common to
programming languages:

'@'
     '@' is a binary operator for treating parts of memory as arrays.
     *Note Artificial Arrays: Arrays, for more information.

'::'
     '::' allows you to specify a variable in terms of the file or
     function where it is defined.  *Note Program Variables: Variables.

'{TYPE} ADDR'
     Refers to an object of type TYPE stored at address ADDR in memory.
     The address ADDR may be any expression whose value is an integer or
     pointer (but parentheses are required around binary operators, just
     as in a cast).  This construct is allowed regardless of what kind
     of data is normally supposed to reside at ADDR.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Ambiguous Expressions,  Next: Variables,  Prev: Expressions,  Up: Data

10.2 Ambiguous Expressions
==========================

Expressions can sometimes contain some ambiguous elements.  For
instance, some programming languages (notably Ada, C++ and Objective-C)
permit a single function name to be defined several times, for
application in different contexts.  This is called "overloading".
Another example involving Ada is generics.  A "generic package" is
similar to C++ templates and is typically instantiated several times,
resulting in the same function name being defined in different contexts.

   In some cases and depending on the language, it is possible to adjust
the expression to remove the ambiguity.  For instance in C++, you can
specify the signature of the function you want to break on, as in 'break
FUNCTION(TYPES)'.  In Ada, using the fully qualified name of your
function often makes the expression unambiguous as well.

   When an ambiguity that needs to be resolved is detected, the debugger
has the capability to display a menu of numbered choices for each
possibility, and then waits for the selection with the prompt '>'.  The
first option is always '[0] cancel', and typing '0 <RET>' aborts the
current command.  If the command in which the expression was used allows
more than one choice to be selected, the next option in the menu is '[1]
all', and typing '1 <RET>' selects all possible choices.

   For example, the following session excerpt shows an attempt to set a
breakpoint at the overloaded symbol 'String::after'.  We choose three

     (gdb)

'set multiple-symbols MODE'

     This option allows you to adjust the debugger behavior when an
     expression is ambiguous.

     By default, MODE is set to 'all'.  If the command with which the
     expression is used allows more than one choice, then GDB
     automatically selects all possible choices.  For instance,
     inserting a breakpoint on a function using an ambiguous name
     results in a breakpoint inserted on each possible match.  However,
     if a unique choice must be made, then GDB uses the menu to help you
     disambiguate the expression.  For instance, printing the address of
     an overloaded function will result in the use of the menu.

     When MODE is set to 'ask', the debugger always uses the menu when
     an ambiguity is detected.

     Finally, when MODE is set to 'cancel', the debugger reports an
     error due to the ambiguity and the command is aborted.

10.3 Program Variables
======================

The most common kind of expression to use is the name of a variable in
your program.

   Variables in expressions are understood in the selected stack frame
(*note Selecting a Frame: Selection.); they must be either:

   * global (or file-static)

or

   * visible according to the scope rules of the programming language
     from the point of execution in that frame

This means that in the function

     foo (a)
          int a;
     {
       bar (a);
       {
         int b = test ();
         bar (b);
       }
     }

you can examine and use the variable 'a' whenever your program is
executing within the function 'foo', but you can only use or examine the
variable 'b' while your program is executing inside the block where 'b'
is declared.

   There is an exception: you can refer to a variable or function whose
scope is a single source file even if the current execution point is not
in this file.  But it is possible to have more than one such variable or
function with the same name (in different source files).  If that
happens, referring to that name has unpredictable effects.  If you wish,
you can specify a static variable in a particular function or file by
using the colon-colon ('::') notation:

     FILE::VARIABLE
     FUNCTION::VARIABLE

Here FILE or FUNCTION is the name of the context for the static
VARIABLE.  In the case of file names, you can use quotes to make sure
GDB parses the file name as a single word--for example, to print a
global value of 'x' defined in 'f2.c':

     (gdb) p 'f2.c'::x

   The '::' notation is normally used for referring to static variables,
since you typically disambiguate uses of local variables in functions by
selecting the appropriate frame and using the simple name of the
variable.  However, you may also use this notation to refer to local
variables in frames enclosing the selected frame:

     void
     foo (int a)
     {
       if (a < 10)
         bar (a);
       else
         process (a);    /* Stop here */
     }

     int
     bar (int a)
     {
       foo (a + 5);
     }

For example, if there is a breakpoint at the commented line, here is
what you might see when the program stops after executing the call
'bar(0)':

     (gdb) p a
     $1 = 10
     (gdb) p bar::a
     $2 = 5
     (gdb) up 2
     #2  0x080483d0 in foo (a=5) at foobar.c:12
     (gdb) p a
     $3 = 5
     (gdb) p bar::a
     $4 = 0

   These uses of '::' are very rarely in conflict with the very similar
use of the same notation in C++.  When they are in conflict, the C++
meaning takes precedence; however, this can be overridden by quoting the
file or function name with single quotes.

   For example, suppose the program is stopped in a method of a class
that has a field named 'includefile', and there is also an include file
named 'includefile' that defines a variable, 'some_global'.

     (gdb) p includefile
     $1 = 23
     (gdb) p includefile::some_global
     A syntax error in expression, near `'.
     (gdb) p 'includefile'::some_global
     $2 = 27

     _Warning:_ Occasionally, a local variable may appear to have the
     wrong value at certain points in a function--just after entry to a
     new scope, and just before exit.
   You may see this problem when you are stepping by machine
instructions.  This is because, on most machines, it takes more than one
instruction to set up a stack frame (including local variable
definitions); if you are stepping by machine instructions, variables may
appear to have the wrong values until the stack frame is completely
built.  On exit, it usually also takes more than one machine instruction
to destroy a stack frame; after you begin stepping through that group of
instructions, local variable definitions may be gone.

   This may also happen when the compiler does significant
optimizations.  To be sure of always seeing accurate values, turn off
all optimization when compiling.

   Another possible effect of compiler optimizations is to optimize
unused variables out of existence, or assign variables to registers (as
opposed to memory addresses).  Depending on the support for such cases
offered by the debug info format used by the compiler, GDB might not be
able to display values for such local variables.  If that happens, GDB
will print a message like this:

     No symbol "foo" in current context.

   To solve such problems, either recompile without optimizations, or
use a different debug info format, if the compiler supports several such
formats.  *Note Compilation::, for more information on choosing compiler
options.  *Note C and C++: C, for more information about debug info
formats that are best suited to C++ programs.

   If you ask to print an object whose contents are unknown to GDB,
e.g., because its data type is not completely specified by the debug
information, GDB will say '<incomplete type>'.  *Note incomplete type:
Symbols, for more about this.

   If you append '@entry' string to a function parameter name you get
its value at the time the function got called.  If the value is not
available an error message is printed.  Entry values are available only
with some compilers.  Entry values are normally also printed at the
function parameter list according to *note set print entry-values::.

     Breakpoint 1, d (i=30) at gdb.base/entry-value.c:29
     29	  i++;
     (gdb) next
     30	  e (i);
     (gdb) print i
     $1 = 31
     (gdb) print i@entry
     $2 = 30

   Strings are identified as arrays of 'char' values without specified
signedness.  Arrays of either 'signed char' or 'unsigned char' get
printed as arrays of 1 byte sized integers.  '-fsigned-char' or
'-funsigned-char' GCC options have no effect as GDB defines literal
string type '"char"' as 'char' without a sign.  For program code

     char var0[] = "A";
     signed char var1[] = "A";

   You get during debugging
     (gdb) print var0
     $1 = "A"
     (gdb) print var1
     $2 = {65 'A', 0 '\0'}

10.4 Artificial Arrays
======================

It is often useful to print out several successive objects of the same
type in memory; a section of an array, or an array of dynamically
determined size for which only a pointer exists in the program.

   You can do this by referring to a contiguous span of memory as an
"artificial array", using the binary operator '@'.  The left operand of
'@' should be the first element of the desired array and be an
individual object.  The right operand should be the desired length of
the array.  The result is an array value whose elements are all of the
type of the left argument.  The first element is actually the left
argument; the second element comes from bytes of memory immediately
following those that hold the first element, and so on.  Here is an
example.  If a program says

     int *array = (int *) malloc (len * sizeof (int));

you can print the contents of 'array' with

     p *array@len

   The left operand of '@' must reside in memory.  Array values made
with '@' in this way behave just like other arrays in terms of
subscripting, and are coerced to pointers when used in expressions.
Artificial arrays most often appear in expressions via the value history
(*note Value History: Value History.), after printing one out.

   Another way to create an artificial array is to use a cast.  This
re-interprets a value as if it were an array.  The value need not be in
memory:
     (gdb) p/x (short[2])0x12345678
     $1 = {0x1234, 0x5678}

   As a convenience, if you leave the array length out (as in
'(TYPE[])VALUE') GDB calculates the size to fill the value (as
'sizeof(VALUE)/sizeof(TYPE)':
     (gdb) p/x (short[])0x12345678
     $2 = {0x1234, 0x5678}

   Sometimes the artificial array mechanism is not quite enough; in
moderately complex data structures, the elements of interest may not
actually be adjacent--for example, if you are interested in the values
of pointers in an array.  One useful work-around in this situation is to
use a convenience variable (*note Convenience Variables: Convenience
Vars.) as a counter in an expression that prints the first interesting
value, and then repeat that expression via <RET>.  For instance, suppose
you have an array 'dtab' of pointers to structures, and you are
interested in the values of a field 'fv' in each structure.  Here is an
example of what you might type:

     set $i = 0
     p dtab[$i++]->fv
     <RET>
     <RET>
     ...

10.5 Output Formats
===================

By default, GDB prints a value according to its data type.  Sometimes
this is not what you want.  For example, you might want to print a
number in hex, or a pointer in decimal.  Or you might want to view data
in memory at a certain address as a character string or as an
instruction.  To do these things, specify an "output format" when you
print a value.

   The simplest use of output formats is to say how to print a value
already computed.  This is done by starting the arguments of the 'print'
command with a slash and a format letter.  The format letters supported
are:

'x'
     Regard the bits of the value as an integer, and print the integer
     in hexadecimal.

'd'
     Print as integer in signed decimal.

'u'
     Print as integer in unsigned decimal.

'o'
     Print as integer in octal.

't'
     Print as integer in binary.  The letter 't' stands for "two".  (1)

'a'
     Print as an address, both absolute in hexadecimal and as an offset
     from the nearest preceding symbol.  You can use this format used to
     discover where (in what function) an unknown address is located:

          (gdb) p/a 0x54320
          $3 = 0x54320 <_initialize_vx+396>

     The command 'info symbol 0x54320' yields similar results.  *Note
     info symbol: Symbols.

'c'
     Regard as an integer and print it as a character constant.  This
     prints both the numerical value and its character representation.
     The character representation is replaced with the octal escape
     '\nnn' for characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range.

     Without this format, GDB displays 'char', 'unsigned char', and 'signed char'
     data as character constants.  Single-byte members of vectors are
     displayed as integer data.

'f'
     Regard the bits of the value as a floating point number and print
     using typical floating point syntax.

's'
     Regard as a string, if possible.  With this format, pointers to
     single-byte data are displayed as null-terminated strings and
     arrays of single-byte data are displayed as fixed-length strings.
     Other values are displayed in their natural types.

     Without this format, GDB displays pointers to and arrays of 'char',
     'unsigned char', and 'signed char' as strings.  Single-byte members
     of a vector are displayed as an integer array.

'z'
     Like 'x' formatting, the value is treated as an integer and printed
     as hexadecimal, but leading zeros are printed to pad the value to
     the size of the integer type.

'r'
     Print using the 'raw' formatting.  By default, GDB will use a
     Python-based pretty-printer, if one is available (*note Pretty
     Printing::).  This typically results in a higher-level display of
     the value's contents.  The 'r' format bypasses any Python
     pretty-printer which might exist.

   For example, to print the program counter in hex (*note Registers::),
type

     p/x $pc

Note that no space is required before the slash; this is because command
names in GDB cannot contain a slash.

   To reprint the last value in the value history with a different
format, you can use the 'print' command with just a format and no
expression.  For example, 'p/x' reprints the last value in hex.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) 'b' cannot be used because these format letters are also used
with the 'x' command, where 'b' stands for "byte"; see *note Examining
Memory: Memory.

10.6 Examining Memory
=====================

You can use the command 'x' (for "examine") to examine memory in any of
several formats, independently of your program's data types.

'x/NFU ADDR'
'x ADDR'
'x'
     Use the 'x' command to examine memory.

   N, F, and U are all optional parameters that specify how much memory
to display and how to format it; ADDR is an expression giving the
address where you want to start displaying memory.  If you use defaults
for NFU, you need not type the slash '/'.  Several commands set
convenient defaults for ADDR.

N, the repeat count
     The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1.  It
     specifies how much memory (counting by units U) to display.

F, the display format
     The display format is one of the formats used by 'print' ('x', 'd',
     'u', 'o', 't', 'a', 'c', 'f', 's'), and in addition 'i' (for
     machine instructions).  The default is 'x' (hexadecimal) initially.
     The default changes each time you use either 'x' or 'print'.

U, the unit size
     The unit size is any of

     'b'
          Bytes.
     'h'
          Halfwords (two bytes).
     'w'
          Words (four bytes).  This is the initial default.
     'g'
          Giant words (eight bytes).

     Each time you specify a unit size with 'x', that size becomes the
     default unit the next time you use 'x'.  For the 'i' format, the
     unit size is ignored and is normally not written.  For the 's'
     format, the unit size defaults to 'b', unless it is explicitly
     given.  Use 'x /hs' to display 16-bit char strings and 'x /ws' to
     display 32-bit strings.  The next use of 'x /s' will again display
     8-bit strings.  Note that the results depend on the programming
     language of the current compilation unit.  If the language is C,
     the 's' modifier will use the UTF-16 encoding while 'w' will use
     UTF-32.  The encoding is set by the programming language and cannot
     be altered.

ADDR, starting display address
     ADDR is the address where you want GDB to begin displaying memory.
     The expression need not have a pointer value (though it may); it is
     always interpreted as an integer address of a byte of memory.
     *Note Expressions: Expressions, for more information on
     expressions.  The default for ADDR is usually just after the last
     address examined--but several other commands also set the default
     address: 'info breakpoints' (to the address of the last breakpoint
     listed), 'info line' (to the starting address of a line), and
     'print' (if you use it to display a value from memory).

   For example, 'x/3uh 0x54320' is a request to display three halfwords
('h') of memory, formatted as unsigned decimal integers ('u'), starting
at address '0x54320'.  'x/4xw $sp' prints the four words ('w') of memory
above the stack pointer (here, '$sp'; *note Registers: Registers.) in
hexadecimal ('x').

   Since the letters indicating unit sizes are all distinct from the
letters specifying output formats, you do not have to remember whether
unit size or format comes first; either order works.  The output
specifications '4xw' and '4wx' mean exactly the same thing.  (However,
the count N must come first; 'wx4' does not work.)

   Even though the unit size U is ignored for the formats 's' and 'i',
you might still want to use a count N; for example, '3i' specifies that
you want to see three machine instructions, including any operands.  For
convenience, especially when used with the 'display' command, the 'i'
format also prints branch delay slot instructions, if any, beyond the
count specified, which immediately follow the last instruction that is
within the count.  The command 'disassemble' gives an alternative way of
inspecting machine instructions; see *note Source and Machine Code:
Machine Code.

   All the defaults for the arguments to 'x' are designed to make it
easy to continue scanning memory with minimal specifications each time
you use 'x'.  For example, after you have inspected three machine
instructions with 'x/3i ADDR', you can inspect the next seven with just
'x/7'.  If you use <RET> to repeat the 'x' command, the repeat count N
is used again; the other arguments default as for successive uses of
'x'.

   When examining machine instructions, the instruction at current
program counter is shown with a '=>' marker.  For example:

     (gdb) x/5i $pc-6
        0x804837f <main+11>: mov    %esp,%ebp
        0x8048381 <main+13>: push   %ecx
        0x8048382 <main+14>: sub    $0x4,%esp
     => 0x8048385 <main+17>: movl   $0x8048460,(%esp)
        0x804838c <main+24>: call   0x80482d4 <puts@plt>

   The addresses and contents printed by the 'x' command are not saved
in the value history because there is often too much of them and they
would get in the way.  Instead, GDB makes these values available for
subsequent use in expressions as values of the convenience variables
'$_' and '$__'.  After an 'x' command, the last address examined is
available for use in expressions in the convenience variable '$_'.  The
contents of that address, as examined, are available in the convenience
variable '$__'.

   If the 'x' command has a repeat count, the address and contents saved
are from the last memory unit printed; this is not the same as the last
address printed if several units were printed on the last line of
output.

   When you are debugging a program running on a remote target machine
(*note Remote Debugging::), you may wish to verify the program's image
in the remote machine's memory against the executable file you
downloaded to the target.  Or, on any target, you may want to check
whether the program has corrupted its own read-only sections.  The
'compare-sections' command is provided for such situations.

'compare-sections [SECTION-NAME|-r]'
     Compare the data of a loadable section SECTION-NAME in the
     executable file of the program being debugged with the same section
     in the target machine's memory, and report any mismatches.  With no
     arguments, compares all loadable sections.  With an argument of
     '-r', compares all loadable read-only sections.

     Note: for remote targets, this command can be accelerated if the
     target supports computing the CRC checksum of a block of memory
     (*note qCRC packet::).

10.7 Automatic Display
======================

If you find that you want to print the value of an expression frequently
(to see how it changes), you might want to add it to the "automatic
display list" so that GDB prints its value each time your program stops.
Each expression added to the list is given a number to identify it; to
remove an expression from the list, you specify that number.  The
automatic display looks like this:

     2: foo = 38
     3: bar[5] = (struct hack *) 0x3804

This display shows item numbers, expressions and their current values.
As with displays you request manually using 'x' or 'print', you can
specify the output format you prefer; in fact, 'display' decides whether
to use 'print' or 'x' depending your format specification--it uses 'x'
if you specify either the 'i' or 's' format, or a unit size; otherwise
it uses 'print'.

'display EXPR'
     Add the expression EXPR to the list of expressions to display each
     time your program stops.  *Note Expressions: Expressions.

     'display' does not repeat if you press <RET> again after using it.

'display/FMT EXPR'
     For FMT specifying only a display format and not a size or count,
     add the expression EXPR to the auto-display list but arrange to
     display it each time in the specified format FMT.  *Note Output
     Formats: Output Formats.

'display/FMT ADDR'
     For FMT 'i' or 's', or including a unit-size or a number of units,
     add the expression ADDR as a memory address to be examined each
     time your program stops.  Examining means in effect doing 'x/FMT
     ADDR'.  *Note Examining Memory: Memory.

   For example, 'display/i $pc' can be helpful, to see the machine
instruction about to be executed each time execution stops ('$pc' is a
common name for the program counter; *note Registers: Registers.).

'undisplay DNUMS...'
'delete display DNUMS...'
     Remove items from the list of expressions to display.  Specify the
     numbers of the displays that you want affected with the command
     argument DNUMS.  It can be a single display number, one of the
     numbers shown in the first field of the 'info display' display; or
     it could be a range of display numbers, as in '2-4'.

     'undisplay' does not repeat if you press <RET> after using it.
     (Otherwise you would just get the error 'No display number ...'.)

'disable display DNUMS...'
     Disable the display of item numbers DNUMS.  A disabled display item
     is not printed automatically, but is not forgotten.  It may be
     enabled again later.  Specify the numbers of the displays that you
     want affected with the command argument DNUMS.  It can be a single
     display number, one of the numbers shown in the first field of the
     'info display' display; or it could be a range of display numbers,
     as in '2-4'.

'enable display DNUMS...'
     Enable display of item numbers DNUMS.  It becomes effective once
     again in auto display of its expression, until you specify
     otherwise.  Specify the numbers of the displays that you want
     affected with the command argument DNUMS.  It can be a single
     display number, one of the numbers shown in the first field of the
     'info display' display; or it could be a range of display numbers,
     as in '2-4'.

'display'
     Display the current values of the expressions on the list, just as
     is done when your program stops.

'info display'
     Print the list of expressions previously set up to display
     automatically, each one with its item number, but without showing
     the values.  This includes disabled expressions, which are marked
     as such.  It also includes expressions which would not be displayed
     right now because they refer to automatic variables not currently
     available.

   If a display expression refers to local variables, then it does not
make sense outside the lexical context for which it was set up.  Such an
expression is disabled when execution enters a context where one of its
variables is not defined.  For example, if you give the command 'display
last_char' while inside a function with an argument 'last_char', GDB
displays this argument while your program continues to stop inside that
function.  When it stops elsewhere--where there is no variable
'last_char'--the display is disabled automatically.  The next time your
program stops where 'last_char' is meaningful, you can enable the
display expression once again.

10.8 Print Settings
===================

GDB provides the following ways to control how arrays, structures, and
symbols are printed.

These settings are useful for debugging programs in any language:

'set print address'
'set print address on'
     GDB prints memory addresses showing the location of stack traces,
     structure values, pointer values, breakpoints, and so forth, even
     when it also displays the contents of those addresses.  The default
     is 'on'.  For example, this is what a stack frame display looks
     like with 'set print address on':

          (gdb) f
          #0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 "<<", rq=0x34c88 ">>")
              at input.c:530
          530         if (lquote != def_lquote)

'set print address off'
     Do not print addresses when displaying their contents.  For
     example, this is the same stack frame displayed with 'set print
     address off':

          (gdb) set print addr off
          (gdb) f
          #0  set_quotes (lq="<<", rq=">>") at input.c:530
          530         if (lquote != def_lquote)

     You can use 'set print address off' to eliminate all machine
     dependent displays from the GDB interface.  For example, with
     'print address off', you should get the same text for backtraces on
     all machines--whether or not they involve pointer arguments.

'show print address'
     Show whether or not addresses are to be printed.

   When GDB prints a symbolic address, it normally prints the closest
earlier symbol plus an offset.  If that symbol does not uniquely
identify the address (for example, it is a name whose scope is a single
source file), you may need to clarify.  One way to do this is with 'info
line', for example 'info line *0x4537'.  Alternately, you can set GDB to
print the source file and line number when it prints a symbolic address:

'set print symbol-filename on'
     Tell GDB to print the source file name and line number of a symbol
     in the symbolic form of an address.

'set print symbol-filename off'
     Do not print source file name and line number of a symbol.  This is
     the default.

'show print symbol-filename'
     Show whether or not GDB will print the source file name and line
     number of a symbol in the symbolic form of an address.

   Another situation where it is helpful to show symbol filenames and
line numbers is when disassembling code; GDB shows you the line number
and source file that corresponds to each instruction.

   Also, you may wish to see the symbolic form only if the address being
printed is reasonably close to the closest earlier symbol:

'set print max-symbolic-offset MAX-OFFSET'
'set print max-symbolic-offset unlimited'
     Tell GDB to only display the symbolic form of an address if the
     offset between the closest earlier symbol and the address is less
     than MAX-OFFSET.  The default is 'unlimited', which tells GDB to
     always print the symbolic form of an address if any symbol precedes
     it.  Zero is equivalent to 'unlimited'.

'show print max-symbolic-offset'
     Ask how large the maximum offset is that GDB prints in a symbolic
     address.

   If you have a pointer and you are not sure where it points, try 'set
print symbol-filename on'.  Then you can determine the name and source
file location of the variable where it points, using 'p/a POINTER'.
This interprets the address in symbolic form.  For example, here GDB
shows that a variable 'ptt' points at another variable 't', defined in
'hi2.c':

     (gdb) set print symbol-filename on
     (gdb) p/a ptt
     $4 = 0xe008 <t in hi2.c>

     _Warning:_ For pointers that point to a local variable, 'p/a' does
     not show the symbol name and filename of the referent, even with
     the appropriate 'set print' options turned on.

   You can also enable '/a'-like formatting all the time using 'set
print symbol on':

'set print symbol on'
     Tell GDB to print the symbol corresponding to an address, if one
     exists.

'set print symbol off'
     Tell GDB not to print the symbol corresponding to an address.  In
     this mode, GDB will still print the symbol corresponding to
     pointers to functions.  This is the default.

'show print symbol'
     Show whether GDB will display the symbol corresponding to an
     address.

   Other settings control how different kinds of objects are printed:

'set print array'
'set print array on'
     Pretty print arrays.  This format is more convenient to read, but
     uses more space.  The default is off.

'set print array off'
     Return to compressed format for arrays.

'show print array'
     Show whether compressed or pretty format is selected for displaying
     arrays.

'set print array-indexes'
'set print array-indexes on'
     Print the index of each element when displaying arrays.  May be
     more convenient to locate a given element in the array or quickly
     find the index of a given element in that printed array.  The
     default is off.

'set print array-indexes off'
     Stop printing element indexes when displaying arrays.

'show print array-indexes'
     Show whether the index of each element is printed when displaying
     arrays.

'set print elements NUMBER-OF-ELEMENTS'
'set print elements unlimited'
     Set a limit on how many elements of an array GDB will print.  If
     GDB is printing a large array, it stops printing after it has
     printed the number of elements set by the 'set print elements'
     command.  This limit also applies to the display of strings.  When
     GDB starts, this limit is set to 200.  Setting NUMBER-OF-ELEMENTS
     to 'unlimited' or zero means that the number of elements to print
     is unlimited.

'show print elements'
     Display the number of elements of a large array that GDB will
     print.  If the number is 0, then the printing is unlimited.

'set print frame-arguments VALUE'
     This command allows to control how the values of arguments are
     printed when the debugger prints a frame (*note Frames::).  The
     possible values are:

     'all'
          The values of all arguments are printed.

     'scalars'
          Print the value of an argument only if it is a scalar.  The
          value of more complex arguments such as arrays, structures,
          unions, etc, is replaced by '...'.  This is the default.  Here
          is an example where only scalar arguments are shown:

               #1  0x08048361 in call_me (i=3, s=..., ss=0xbf8d508c, u=..., e=green)
                 at frame-args.c:23

     'none'
          None of the argument values are printed.  Instead, the value
          of each argument is replaced by '...'.  In this case, the
          example above now becomes:

               #1  0x08048361 in call_me (i=..., s=..., ss=..., u=..., e=...)
                 at frame-args.c:23

     By default, only scalar arguments are printed.  This command can be
     used to configure the debugger to print the value of all arguments,
     regardless of their type.  However, it is often advantageous to not
     print the value of more complex parameters.  For instance, it
     reduces the amount of information printed in each frame, making the
     backtrace more readable.  Also, it improves performance when
     displaying Ada frames, because the computation of large arguments
     can sometimes be CPU-intensive, especially in large applications.
     Setting 'print frame-arguments' to 'scalars' (the default) or
     'none' avoids this computation, thus speeding up the display of
     each Ada frame.

'show print frame-arguments'
     Show how the value of arguments should be displayed when printing a
     frame.

'set print raw frame-arguments on'
     Print frame arguments in raw, non pretty-printed, form.

'set print raw frame-arguments off'
     Print frame arguments in pretty-printed form, if there is a
     pretty-printer for the value (*note Pretty Printing::), otherwise
     print the value in raw form.  This is the default.

'show print raw frame-arguments'
     Show whether to print frame arguments in raw form.

'set print entry-values VALUE'
     Set printing of frame argument values at function entry.  In some
     cases GDB can determine the value of function argument which was
     passed by the function caller, even if the value was modified
     inside the called function and therefore is different.  With
     optimized code, the current value could be unavailable, but the
     entry value may still be known.

     The default value is 'default' (see below for its description).
     Older GDB behaved as with the setting 'no'.  Compilers not
     supporting this feature will behave in the 'default' setting the
     same way as with the 'no' setting.

     This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging
     format and the compiler has to produce 'DW_TAG_GNU_call_site' tags.
     With GCC, you need to specify '-O -g' during compilation, to get
     this information.

     The VALUE parameter can be one of the following:

     'no'
          Print only actual parameter values, never print values from
          function entry point.
               #0  equal (val=5)
               #0  different (val=6)
               #0  lost (val=<optimized out>)
               #0  born (val=10)
               #0  invalid (val=<optimized out>)

     'only'
          Print only parameter values from function entry point.  The
          actual parameter values are never printed.
               #0  equal (val@entry=5)
               #0  different (val@entry=5)
               #0  lost (val@entry=5)
               #0  born (val@entry=<optimized out>)
               #0  invalid (val@entry=<optimized out>)

     'preferred'
          Print only parameter values from function entry point.  If
          value from function entry point is not known while the actual
          value is known, print the actual value for such parameter.
               #0  equal (val@entry=5)
               #0  different (val@entry=5)
               #0  lost (val@entry=5)
               #0  born (val=10)
               #0  invalid (val@entry=<optimized out>)

     'if-needed'
          Print actual parameter values.  If actual parameter value is
          not known while value from function entry point is known,
          print the entry point value for such parameter.
               #0  equal (val=5)
               #0  different (val=6)
               #0  lost (val@entry=5)
               #0  born (val=10)
               #0  invalid (val=<optimized out>)

     'both'
          Always print both the actual parameter value and its value
          from function entry point, even if values of one or both are
          not available due to compiler optimizations.
               #0  equal (val=5, val@entry=5)
               #0  different (val=6, val@entry=5)
               #0  lost (val=<optimized out>, val@entry=5)
               #0  born (val=10, val@entry=<optimized out>)
               #0  invalid (val=<optimized out>, val@entry=<optimized out>)

     'compact'
          Print the actual parameter value if it is known and also its
          value from function entry point if it is known.  If neither is
          known, print for the actual value '<optimized out>'.  If not
          in MI mode (*note GDB/MI::) and if both values are known and
          identical, print the shortened 'param=param@entry=VALUE'
          notation.
               #0  equal (val=val@entry=5)
               #0  different (val=6, val@entry=5)
               #0  lost (val@entry=5)
               #0  born (val=10)
               #0  invalid (val=<optimized out>)

     'default'
          Always print the actual parameter value.  Print also its value
          from function entry point, but only if it is known.  If not in
          MI mode (*note GDB/MI::) and if both values are known and
          identical, print the shortened 'param=param@entry=VALUE'
          notation.
               #0  equal (val=val@entry=5)
               #0  different (val=6, val@entry=5)
               #0  lost (val=<optimized out>, val@entry=5)
               #0  born (val=10)
               #0  invalid (val=<optimized out>)

     For analysis messages on possible failures of frame argument values
     at function entry resolution see *note set debug entry-values::.

'show print entry-values'
     Show the method being used for printing of frame argument values at
     function entry.

'set print repeats NUMBER-OF-REPEATS'
'set print repeats unlimited'
     Set the threshold for suppressing display of repeated array
     elements.  When the number of consecutive identical elements of an
     array exceeds the threshold, GDB prints the string '"<repeats N
     times>"', where N is the number of identical repetitions, instead
     of displaying the identical elements themselves.  Setting the
     threshold to 'unlimited' or zero will cause all elements to be
     individually printed.  The default threshold is 10.

'show print repeats'
     Display the current threshold for printing repeated identical
     elements.

'set print null-stop'
     Cause GDB to stop printing the characters of an array when the
     first NULL is encountered.  This is useful when large arrays
     actually contain only short strings.  The default is off.

'show print null-stop'
     Show whether GDB stops printing an array on the first NULL
     character.

'set print pretty on'
     Cause GDB to print structures in an indented format with one member
     per line, like this:

          $1 = {
            next = 0x0,
            flags = {
              sweet = 1,
              sour = 1
            },
            meat = 0x54 "Pork"
          }

'set print pretty off'
     Cause GDB to print structures in a compact format, like this:

          $1 = {next = 0x0, flags = {sweet = 1, sour = 1}, \
          meat = 0x54 "Pork"}

     This is the default format.

'show print pretty'
     Show which format GDB is using to print structures.

'set print sevenbit-strings on'
     Print using only seven-bit characters; if this option is set, GDB
     displays any eight-bit characters (in strings or character values)
     using the notation '\'NNN.  This setting is best if you are working
     in English (ASCII) and you use the high-order bit of characters as
     a marker or "meta" bit.

'set print sevenbit-strings off'
     Print full eight-bit characters.  This allows the use of more
     international character sets, and is the default.

'show print sevenbit-strings'
     Show whether or not GDB is printing only seven-bit characters.

'set print union on'
     Tell GDB to print unions which are contained in structures and
     other unions.  This is the default setting.

'set print union off'
     Tell GDB not to print unions which are contained in structures and
     other unions.  GDB will print '"{...}"' instead.

'show print union'
     Ask GDB whether or not it will print unions which are contained in
     structures and other unions.

     For example, given the declarations

          typedef enum {Tree, Bug} Species;
          typedef enum {Big_tree, Acorn, Seedling} Tree_forms;
          typedef enum {Caterpillar, Cocoon, Butterfly}
                        Bug_forms;

          struct thing {
            Species it;
            union {
              Tree_forms tree;
              Bug_forms bug;
            } form;
          };

          struct thing foo = {Tree, {Acorn}};

     with 'set print union on' in effect 'p foo' would print

          $1 = {it = Tree, form = {tree = Acorn, bug = Cocoon}}

     and with 'set print union off' in effect it would print

          $1 = {it = Tree, form = {...}}

     'set print union' affects programs written in C-like languages and
     in Pascal.

These settings are of interest when debugging C++ programs:

'set print demangle'
'set print demangle on'
     Print C++ names in their source form rather than in the encoded
     ("mangled") form passed to the assembler and linker for type-safe
     linkage.  The default is on.

'show print demangle'
     Show whether C++ names are printed in mangled or demangled form.

'set print asm-demangle'
'set print asm-demangle on'
     Print C++ names in their source form rather than their mangled
     form, even in assembler code printouts such as instruction
     disassemblies.  The default is off.

'show print asm-demangle'
     Show whether C++ names in assembly listings are printed in mangled
     or demangled form.

'set demangle-style STYLE'
     Choose among several encoding schemes used by different compilers
     to represent C++ names.  The choices for STYLE are currently:

     'auto'
          Allow GDB to choose a decoding style by inspecting your
          program.  This is the default.

     'gnu'
          Decode based on the GNU C++ compiler ('g++') encoding
          algorithm.

     'hp'
          Decode based on the HP ANSI C++ ('aCC') encoding algorithm.

     'lucid'
          Decode based on the Lucid C++ compiler ('lcc') encoding
          algorithm.

     'arm'
          Decode using the algorithm in the 'C++ Annotated Reference
          Manual'.  *Warning:* this setting alone is not sufficient to
          allow debugging 'cfront'-generated executables.  GDB would
          require further enhancement to permit that.

     If you omit STYLE, you will see a list of possible formats.

'show demangle-style'
     Display the encoding style currently in use for decoding C++
     symbols.

'set print object'
'set print object on'
     When displaying a pointer to an object, identify the _actual_
     (derived) type of the object rather than the _declared_ type, using
     the virtual function table.  Note that the virtual function table
     is required--this feature can only work for objects that have
     run-time type identification; a single virtual method in the
     object's declared type is sufficient.  Note that this setting is
     also taken into account when working with variable objects via MI
     (*note GDB/MI::).

'set print object off'
     Display only the declared type of objects, without reference to the
     virtual function table.  This is the default setting.

'show print object'
     Show whether actual, or declared, object types are displayed.

'set print static-members'
'set print static-members on'
     Print static members when displaying a C++ object.  The default is
     on.

'set print static-members off'
     Do not print static members when displaying a C++ object.

'show print static-members'
     Show whether C++ static members are printed or not.

'set print pascal_static-members'
'set print pascal_static-members on'
     Print static members when displaying a Pascal object.  The default
     is on.

'set print pascal_static-members off'
     Do not print static members when displaying a Pascal object.

'show print pascal_static-members'
     Show whether Pascal static members are printed or not.

'set print vtbl'
'set print vtbl on'
     Pretty print C++ virtual function tables.  The default is off.
     (The 'vtbl' commands do not work on programs compiled with the HP
     ANSI C++ compiler ('aCC').)

'set print vtbl off'
     Do not pretty print C++ virtual function tables.

'show print vtbl'
     Show whether C++ virtual function tables are pretty printed, or
     not.

10.9 Pretty Printing
====================

GDB provides a mechanism to allow pretty-printing of values using Python
code.  It greatly simplifies the display of complex objects.  This
mechanism works for both MI and the CLI.

10.9.1 Pretty-Printer Introduction
----------------------------------

When GDB prints a value, it first sees if there is a pretty-printer
registered for the value.  If there is then GDB invokes the
pretty-printer to print the value.  Otherwise the value is printed
normally.

   Pretty-printers are normally named.  This makes them easy to manage.
The 'info pretty-printer' command will list all the installed
pretty-printers with their names.  If a pretty-printer can handle
multiple data types, then its "subprinters" are the printers for the
individual data types.  Each such subprinter has its own name.  The
format of the name is PRINTER-NAME;SUBPRINTER-NAME.

   Pretty-printers are installed by "registering" them with GDB.
Typically they are automatically loaded and registered when the
corresponding debug information is loaded, thus making them available
without having to do anything special.

   There are three places where a pretty-printer can be registered.

   * Pretty-printers registered globally are available when debugging
     all inferiors.

   * Pretty-printers registered with a program space are available only
     when debugging that program.  *Note Progspaces In Python::, for
     more details on program spaces in Python.

   * Pretty-printers registered with an objfile are loaded and unloaded
     with the corresponding objfile (e.g., shared library).  *Note
     Objfiles In Python::, for more details on objfiles in Python.

   *Note Selecting Pretty-Printers::, for further information on how
pretty-printers are selected,

for new types.

10.9.2 Pretty-Printer Example
-----------------------------

Here is how a C++ 'std::string' looks without a pretty-printer:

     (gdb) print s
     $1 = {
       static npos = 4294967295,
       _M_dataplus = {
         <std::allocator<char>> = {
           <__gnu_cxx::new_allocator<char>> = {
             <No data fields>}, <No data fields>
           },
         members of std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>,
           std::allocator<char> >::_Alloc_hider:
         _M_p = 0x804a014 "abcd"
       }
     }

   With a pretty-printer for 'std::string' only the contents are
printed:

     (gdb) print s
     $2 = "abcd"

10.9.3 Pretty-Printer Commands
------------------------------

'info pretty-printer [OBJECT-REGEXP [NAME-REGEXP]]'
     Print the list of installed pretty-printers.  This includes
     disabled pretty-printers, which are marked as such.

     OBJECT-REGEXP is a regular expression matching the objects whose
     pretty-printers to list.  Objects can be 'global', the program
     space's file (*note Progspaces In Python::), and the object files
     within that program space (*note Objfiles In Python::).  *Note
     Selecting Pretty-Printers::, for details on how GDB looks up a
     printer from these three objects.

     NAME-REGEXP is a regular expression matching the name of the
     printers to list.

'disable pretty-printer [OBJECT-REGEXP [NAME-REGEXP]]'
     Disable pretty-printers matching OBJECT-REGEXP and NAME-REGEXP.  A
     disabled pretty-printer is not forgotten, it may be enabled again
     later.

'enable pretty-printer [OBJECT-REGEXP [NAME-REGEXP]]'
     Enable pretty-printers matching OBJECT-REGEXP and NAME-REGEXP.

   Example:

   Suppose we have three pretty-printers installed: one from library1.so
named 'foo' that prints objects of type 'foo', and another from
library2.so named 'bar' that prints two types of objects, 'bar1' and
'bar2'.

     (gdb) info pretty-printer
     library1.so:
       foo
     library2.so:
       bar
         bar1
         bar2
     (gdb) info pretty-printer library2
     library2.so:
       bar

10.10 Value History
===================

Values printed by the 'print' command are saved in the GDB "value
history".  This allows you to refer to them in other expressions.
Values are kept until the symbol table is re-read or discarded (for
example with the 'file' or 'symbol-file' commands).  When the symbol
table changes, the value history is discarded, since the values may
contain pointers back to the types defined in the symbol table.

   The values printed are given "history numbers" by which you can refer
to them.  These are successive integers starting with one.  'print'
shows you the history number assigned to a value by printing '$NUM = '
before the value; here NUM is the history number.

   To refer to any previous value, use '$' followed by the value's
history number.  The way 'print' labels its output is designed to remind
you of this.  Just '$' refers to the most recent value in the history,
and '$$' refers to the value before that.  '$$N' refers to the Nth value
from the end; '$$2' is the value just prior to '$$', '$$1' is equivalent
to '$$', and '$$0' is equivalent to '$'.

   For example, suppose you have just printed a pointer to a structure
and want to see the contents of the structure.  It suffices to type

     p *$

   If you have a chain of structures where the component 'next' points
to the next one, you can print the contents of the next one with this:

     p *$.next

You can print successive links in the chain by repeating this
command--which you can do by just typing <RET>.

   Note that the history records values, not expressions.  If the value
of 'x' is 4 and you type these commands:

     print x
     set x=5

then the value recorded in the value history by the 'print' command
remains 4 even though the value of 'x' has changed.

'show values'
     Print the last ten values in the value history, with their item
     numbers.  This is like 'p $$9' repeated ten times, except that
     'show values' does not change the history.

'show values N'
     Print ten history values centered on history item number N.

'show values +'
     Print ten history values just after the values last printed.  If no
     more values are available, 'show values +' produces no display.

   Pressing <RET> to repeat 'show values N' has exactly the same effect
as 'show values +'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Convenience Vars,  Next: Convenience Funs,  Prev: Value History,  Up: Data

10.11 Convenience Variables
===========================

GDB provides "convenience variables" that you can use within GDB to hold
on to a value and refer to it later.  These variables exist entirely
within GDB; they are not part of your program, and setting a convenience
variable has no direct effect on further execution of your program.
That is why you can use them freely.

   Convenience variables are prefixed with '$'.  Any name preceded by
'$' can be used for a convenience variable, unless it is one of the
predefined machine-specific register names (*note Registers:
Registers.).  (Value history references, in contrast, are _numbers_
preceded by '$'.  *Note Value History: Value History.)

   You can save a value in a convenience variable with an assignment
expression, just as you would set a variable in your program.  For
example:

     set $foo = *object_ptr

would save in '$foo' the value contained in the object pointed to by
'object_ptr'.

   Using a convenience variable for the first time creates it, but its
value is 'void' until you assign a new value.  You can alter the value
with another assignment at any time.

   Convenience variables have no fixed types.  You can assign a
convenience variable any type of value, including structures and arrays,
even if that variable already has a value of a different type.  The
convenience variable, when used as an expression, has the type of its
current value.

'show convenience'
     Print a list of convenience variables used so far, and their
     values, as well as a list of the convenience functions.
     Abbreviated 'show conv'.

'init-if-undefined $VARIABLE = EXPRESSION'
     Set a convenience variable if it has not already been set.  This is
     useful for user-defined commands that keep some state.  It is
     similar, in concept, to using local static variables with
     initializers in C (except that convenience variables are global).
     It can also be used to allow users to override default values used
     in a command script.

     If the variable is already defined then the expression is not
     evaluated so any side-effects do not occur.

   One of the ways to use a convenience variable is as a counter to be
incremented or a pointer to be advanced.  For example, to print a field
from successive elements of an array of structures:

     set $i = 0
     print bar[$i++]->contents

Repeat that command by typing <RET>.

   Some convenience variables are created automatically by GDB and given
values likely to be useful.

'$_'
     The variable '$_' is automatically set by the 'x' command to the
     last address examined (*note Examining Memory: Memory.).  Other
     commands which provide a default address for 'x' to examine also
     set '$_' to that address; these commands include 'info line' and
     'info breakpoint'.  The type of '$_' is 'void *' except when set by
     the 'x' command, in which case it is a pointer to the type of
     '$__'.

'$__'
     The variable '$__' is automatically set by the 'x' command to the
     value found in the last address examined.  Its type is chosen to
     match the format in which the data was printed.

'$_exitcode'
     When the program being debugged terminates normally, GDB
     automatically sets this variable to the exit code of the program,
     and resets '$_exitsignal' to 'void'.

'$_exitsignal'
     When the program being debugged dies due to an uncaught signal, GDB
     automatically sets this variable to that signal's number, and
     resets '$_exitcode' to 'void'.

     To distinguish between whether the program being debugged has
     exited (i.e., '$_exitcode' is not 'void') or signalled (i.e.,
     '$_exitsignal' is not 'void'), the convenience function '$_isvoid'
     can be used (*note Convenience Functions: Convenience Funs.).  For
     example, considering the following source code:

          #include <signal.h>

          int
          main (int argc, char *argv[])
          {
            raise (SIGALRM);
            return 0;
          }

     A valid way of telling whether the program being debugged has
     exited or signalled would be:

          (gdb) define has_exited_or_signalled
          Type commands for definition of ``has_exited_or_signalled''.
          End with a line saying just ``end''.
          >if $_isvoid ($_exitsignal)
           >echo The program has exited\n
           >else
           >echo The program has signalled\n
           >end
          >end
          (gdb) run
          Starting program:

          Program terminated with signal SIGALRM, Alarm clock.
          The program no longer exists.
          (gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
          The program has signalled

     As can be seen, GDB correctly informs that the program being
     debugged has signalled, since it calls 'raise' and raises a
     'SIGALRM' signal.  If the program being debugged had not called
     'raise', then GDB would report a normal exit:

          (gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
          The program has exited

'$_exception'
     The variable '$_exception' is set to the exception object being
     thrown at an exception-related catchpoint.  *Note Set
     Catchpoints::.

'$_probe_argc'
'$_probe_arg0...$_probe_arg11'
     Arguments to a static probe.  *Note Static Probe Points::.

'$_sdata'
     The variable '$_sdata' contains extra collected static tracepoint
     data.  *Note Tracepoint Action Lists: Tracepoint Actions.  Note
     that '$_sdata' could be empty, if not inspecting a trace buffer, or
     if extra static tracepoint data has not been collected.

'$_siginfo'
     The variable '$_siginfo' contains extra signal information (*note
     extra signal information::).  Note that '$_siginfo' could be empty,
     if the application has not yet received any signals.  For example,
     it will be empty before you execute the 'run' command.

'$_tlb'
     The variable '$_tlb' is automatically set when debugging
     applications running on MS-Windows in native mode or connected to
     gdbserver that supports the 'qGetTIBAddr' request.  *Note General
     Query Packets::.  This variable contains the address of the thread
     information block.

   On HP-UX systems, if you refer to a function or variable name that
begins with a dollar sign, GDB searches for a user or system name first,
before it searches for a convenience variable.

10.12 Convenience Functions
===========================

GDB also supplies some "convenience functions".  These have a syntax
similar to convenience variables.  A convenience function can be used in
an expression just like an ordinary function; however, a convenience
function is implemented internally to GDB.

   These functions do not require GDB to be configured with 'Python'
support, which means that they are always available.

'$_isvoid (EXPR)'
     Return one if the expression EXPR is 'void'.  Otherwise it returns
     zero.

     A 'void' expression is an expression where the type of the result
     is 'void'.  For example, you can examine a convenience variable
     (see *note Convenience Variables: Convenience Vars.) to check
     whether it is 'void':

          (gdb) print $_exitcode
          $1 = void
          (gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
          $2 = 1
          (gdb) run
          Starting program: ./a.out
          [Inferior 1 (process 29572) exited normally]
          (gdb) print $_exitcode
          $3 = 0
          (gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
          $4 = 0

     In the example above, we used '$_isvoid' to check whether
     '$_exitcode' is 'void' before and after the execution of the
     program being debugged.  Before the execution there is no exit code
     to be examined, therefore '$_exitcode' is 'void'.  After the
     execution the program being debugged returned zero, therefore
     '$_exitcode' is zero, which means that it is not 'void' anymore.

     The 'void' expression can also be a call of a function from the
     program being debugged.  For example, given the following function:

          void
          foo (void)
          {
          }

     The result of calling it inside GDB is 'void':

          (gdb) print foo ()
          $1 = void
          (gdb) print $_isvoid (foo ())
          $2 = 1
          (gdb) set $v = foo ()
          (gdb) print $v
          $3 = void
          (gdb) print $_isvoid ($v)
          $4 = 1

   These functions require GDB to be configured with 'Python' support.

'$_memeq(BUF1, BUF2, LENGTH)'
     Returns one if the LENGTH bytes at the addresses given by BUF1 and
     BUF2 are equal.  Otherwise it returns zero.

'$_regex(STR, REGEX)'
     Returns one if the string STR matches the regular expression REGEX.
     Otherwise it returns zero.  The syntax of the regular expression is
     that specified by 'Python''s regular expression support.

'$_streq(STR1, STR2)'
     Returns one if the strings STR1 and STR2 are equal.  Otherwise it
     returns zero.

'$_strlen(STR)'
     Returns the length of string STR.

   GDB provides the ability to list and get help on convenience
functions.

'help function'
     Print a list of all convenience functions.

10.13 Registers
===============

You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables
with names starting with '$'.  The names of registers are different for
each machine; use 'info registers' to see the names used on your
machine.

'info registers'
     Print the names and values of all registers except floating-point
     and vector registers (in the selected stack frame).

'info all-registers'
     Print the names and values of all registers, including
     floating-point and vector registers (in the selected stack frame).

'info registers REGNAME ...'
     Print the "relativized" value of each specified register REGNAME.
     As discussed in detail below, register values are normally relative
     to the selected stack frame.  The REGNAME may be any register name
     valid on the machine you are using, with or without the initial
     '$'.

   GDB has four "standard" register names that are available (in
expressions) on most machines--whenever they do not conflict with an
architecture's canonical mnemonics for registers.  The register names
'$pc' and '$sp' are used for the program counter register and the stack
pointer.  '$fp' is used for a register that contains a pointer to the
current stack frame, and '$ps' is used for a register that contains the
processor status.  For example, you could print the program counter in
hex with

     p/x $pc

or print the instruction to be executed next with

     x/i $pc

or add four to the stack pointer(1) with

     set $sp += 4

   Whenever possible, these four standard register names are available
on your machine even though the machine has different canonical
mnemonics, so long as there is no conflict.  The 'info registers'
command shows the canonical names.  For example, on the SPARC, 'info
registers' displays the processor status register as '$psr' but you can
also refer to it as '$ps'; and on x86-based machines '$ps' is an alias
for the EFLAGS register.

   GDB always considers the contents of an ordinary register as an
integer when the register is examined in this way.  Some machines have
special registers which can hold nothing but floating point; these
registers are considered to have floating point values.  There is no way
to refer to the contents of an ordinary register as floating point value
(although you can _print_ it as a floating point value with 'print/f
$REGNAME').

   Some registers have distinct "raw" and "virtual" data formats.  This
means that the data format in which the register contents are saved by
the operating system is not the same one that your program normally
sees.  For example, the registers of the 68881 floating point
coprocessor are always saved in "extended" (raw) format, but all C
programs expect to work with "double" (virtual) format.  In such cases,
GDB normally works with the virtual format only (the format that makes
sense for your program), but the 'info registers' command prints the
data in both formats.

   Some machines have special registers whose contents can be
interpreted in several different ways.  For example, modern x86-based
machines have SSE and MMX registers that can hold several values packed
together in several different formats.  GDB refers to such registers in
'struct' notation:

     (gdb) print $xmm1
     $1 = {
       v4_float = {0, 3.43859137e-038, 1.54142831e-044, 1.821688e-044},
       v2_double = {9.92129282474342e-303, 2.7585945287983262e-313},
       v16_int8 = "\000\000\000\000\3706;\001\v\000\000\000\r\000\000",
       v8_int16 = {0, 0, 14072, 315, 11, 0, 13, 0},
       v4_int32 = {0, 20657912, 11, 13},
       v2_int64 = {88725056443645952, 55834574859},
       uint128 = 0x0000000d0000000b013b36f800000000
     }

To set values of such registers, you need to tell GDB which view of the
register you wish to change, as if you were assigning value to a
'struct' member:

      (gdb) set $xmm1.uint128 = 0x000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF

   Normally, register values are relative to the selected stack frame
(*note Selecting a Frame: Selection.).  This means that you get the
value that the register would contain if all stack frames farther in
were exited and their saved registers restored.  In order to see the
true contents of hardware registers, you must select the innermost frame
(with 'frame 0').

   Usually ABIs reserve some registers as not needed to be saved by the
callee (a.k.a.: "caller-saved", "call-clobbered" or "volatile"
registers).  It may therefore not be possible for GDB to know the value
a register had before the call (in other words, in the outer frame), if
the register value has since been changed by the callee.  GDB tries to
deduce where the inner frame saved ("callee-saved") registers, from the
debug info, unwind info, or the machine code generated by your compiler.
If some register is not saved, and GDB knows the register is
"caller-saved" (via its own knowledge of the ABI, or because the
debug/unwind info explicitly says the register's value is undefined),
GDB displays '<not saved>' as the register's value.  With targets that
GDB has no knowledge of the register saving convention, if a register
was not saved by the callee, then its value and location in the outer
frame are assumed to be the same of the inner frame.  This is usually
harmless, because if the register is call-clobbered, the caller either
does not care what is in the register after the call, or has code to
restore the value that it does care about.  Note, however, that if you
change such a register in the outer frame, you may also be affecting the
inner frame.  Also, the more "outer" the frame is you're looking at, the
more likely a call-clobbered register's value is to be wrong, in the
sense that it doesn't actually represent the value the register had just
before the call.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is a way of removing one word from the stack, on machines
where stacks grow downward in memory (most machines, nowadays).  This
assumes that the innermost stack frame is selected; setting '$sp' is not
allowed when other stack frames are selected.  To pop entire frames off
the stack, regardless of machine architecture, use 'return'; see *note
Returning from a Function: Returning.

10.14 Floating Point Hardware
=============================

Depending on the configuration, GDB may be able to give you more
information about the status of the floating point hardware.

'info float'
     Display hardware-dependent information about the floating point
     unit.  The exact contents and layout vary depending on the floating
     point chip.  Currently, 'info float' is supported on the ARM and
     x86 machines.

10.15 Vector Unit
=================

Depending on the configuration, GDB may be able to give you more
information about the status of the vector unit.

'info vector'
     Display information about the vector unit.  The exact contents and
     layout vary depending on the hardware.


File: gdb.info,  Node: OS Information,  Next: Memory Region Attributes,  Prev: Vector Unit,  Up: Data

10.16 Operating System Auxiliary Information
============================================

GDB provides interfaces to useful OS facilities that can help you debug
your program.

   Some operating systems supply an "auxiliary vector" to programs at
startup.  This is akin to the arguments and environment that you specify
for a program, but contains a system-dependent variety of binary values
that tell system libraries important details about the hardware,
operating system, and process.  Each value's purpose is identified by an
integer tag; the meanings are well-known but system-specific.  Depending
on the configuration and operating system facilities, GDB may be able to
show you this information.  For remote targets, this functionality may
further depend on the remote stub's support of the 'qXfer:auxv:read'
packet, see *note qXfer auxiliary vector read::.

'info auxv'
     Display the auxiliary vector of the inferior, which can be either a
     live process or a core dump file.  GDB prints each tag value
     numerically, and also shows names and text descriptions for
     recognized tags.  Some values in the vector are numbers, some bit
     masks, and some pointers to strings or other data.  GDB displays
     each value in the most appropriate form for a recognized tag, and
     in hexadecimal for an unrecognized tag.

   On some targets, GDB can access operating system-specific information
and show it to you.  The types of information available will differ
depending on the type of operating system running on the target.  The
mechanism used to fetch the data is described in *note Operating System
Information::.  For remote targets, this functionality depends on the
remote stub's support of the 'qXfer:osdata:read' packet, see *note qXfer
osdata read::.

'info os INFOTYPE'

     Display OS information of the requested type.

     On GNU/Linux, the following values of INFOTYPE are valid:

     'processes'
          Display the list of processes on the target.  For each
          process, GDB prints the process identifier, the name of the
          user, the command corresponding to the process, and the list
          of processor cores that the process is currently running on.
          (To understand what these properties mean, for this and the
          following info types, please consult the general GNU/Linux
          documentation.)

     'procgroups'
          Display the list of process groups on the target.  For each
          process, GDB prints the identifier of the process group that
          it belongs to, the command corresponding to the process group
          leader, the process identifier, and the command line of the
          process.  The list is sorted first by the process group
          identifier, then by the process identifier, so that processes
          belonging to the same process group are grouped together and
          the process group leader is listed first.

     'threads'
          Display the list of threads running on the target.  For each
          thread, GDB prints the identifier of the process that the
          thread belongs to, the command of the process, the thread
          identifier, and the processor core that it is currently
          running on.  The main thread of a process is not listed.

     'files'
          Display the list of open file descriptors on the target.  For
          each file descriptor, GDB prints the identifier of the process
          owning the descriptor, the command of the owning process, the
          value of the descriptor, and the target of the descriptor.

     'sockets'
          Display the list of Internet-domain sockets on the target.
          For each socket, GDB prints the address and port of the local
          and remote endpoints, the current state of the connection, the
          creator of the socket, the IP address family of the socket,
          and the type of the connection.

     'shm'
          Display the list of all System V shared-memory regions on the
          target.  For each shared-memory region, GDB prints the region
          key, the shared-memory identifier, the access permissions, the
          size of the region, the process that created the region, the
          process that last attached to or detached from the region, the
          current number of live attaches to the region, and the times
          at which the region was last attached to, detach from, and
          changed.

     'semaphores'
          Display the list of all System V semaphore sets on the target.
          For each semaphore set, GDB prints the semaphore set key, the
          semaphore set identifier, the access permissions, the number
          of semaphores in the set, the user and group of the owner and
          creator of the semaphore set, and the times at which the
          semaphore set was operated upon and changed.

     'msg'
          Display the list of all System V message queues on the target.
          For each message queue, GDB prints the message queue key, the
          message queue identifier, the access permissions, the current
          number of bytes on the queue, the current number of messages
          on the queue, the processes that last sent and received a
          message on the queue, the user and group of the owner and
          creator of the message queue, the times at which a message was
          last sent and received on the queue, and the time at which the
          message queue was last changed.

     'modules'
          Display the list of all loaded kernel modules on the target.
          For each module, GDB prints the module name, the size of the
          module in bytes, the number of times the module is used, the
          dependencies of the module, the status of the module, and the
          address of the loaded module in memory.

'info os'
     If INFOTYPE is omitted, then list the possible values for INFOTYPE
     and the kind of OS information available for each INFOTYPE.  If the
     target does not return a list of possible types, this command will
     report an error.

10.17 Memory Region Attributes
==============================

"Memory region attributes" allow you to describe special handling
required by regions of your target's memory.  GDB uses attributes to
determine whether to allow certain types of memory accesses; whether to
use specific width accesses; and whether to cache target memory.  By
default the description of memory regions is fetched from the target (if
the current target supports this), but the user can override the fetched
regions.

   Defined memory regions can be individually enabled and disabled.
When a memory region is disabled, GDB uses the default attributes when
accessing memory in that region.  Similarly, if no memory regions have
been defined, GDB uses the default attributes when accessing all memory.

   When a memory region is defined, it is given a number to identify it;
to enable, disable, or remove a memory region, you specify that number.

'mem LOWER UPPER ATTRIBUTES...'
     Define a memory region bounded by LOWER and UPPER with attributes
     ATTRIBUTES..., and add it to the list of regions monitored by GDB.
     Note that UPPER == 0 is a special case: it is treated as the
     target's maximum memory address.  (0xffff on 16 bit targets,
     0xffffffff on 32 bit targets, etc.)

'mem auto'
     Discard any user changes to the memory regions and use
     target-supplied regions, if available, or no regions if the target
     does not support.

'delete mem NUMS...'
     Remove memory regions NUMS... from the list of regions monitored by
     GDB.

'disable mem NUMS...'
     Disable monitoring of memory regions NUMS....  A disabled memory
     region is not forgotten.  It may be enabled again later.

'enable mem NUMS...'
     Enable monitoring of memory regions NUMS....

'info mem'
     Print a table of all defined memory regions, with the following
     columns for each region:

     _Memory Region Number_
     _Enabled or Disabled._
          Enabled memory regions are marked with 'y'.  Disabled memory
          regions are marked with 'n'.

     _Lo Address_
          The address defining the inclusive lower bound of the memory
          region.

     _Hi Address_
          The address defining the exclusive upper bound of the memory
          region.

     _Attributes_
          The list of attributes set for this memory region.

10.17.1 Attributes
------------------

10.17.1.1 Memory Access Mode
............................

The access mode attributes set whether GDB may make read or write
accesses to a memory region.

   While these attributes prevent GDB from performing invalid memory
accesses, they do nothing to prevent the target system, I/O DMA, etc.
from accessing memory.

'ro'
     Memory is read only.
'wo'
     Memory is write only.
'rw'
     Memory is read/write.  This is the default.

10.17.1.2 Memory Access Size
............................

The access size attribute tells GDB to use specific sized accesses in
the memory region.  Often memory mapped device registers require
specific sized accesses.  If no access size attribute is specified, GDB
may use accesses of any size.

'8'
     Use 8 bit memory accesses.
'16'
     Use 16 bit memory accesses.
'32'
     Use 32 bit memory accesses.
'64'
     Use 64 bit memory accesses.

10.17.1.3 Data Cache
....................

The data cache attributes set whether GDB will cache target memory.
While this generally improves performance by reducing debug protocol
overhead, it can lead to incorrect results because GDB does not know
about volatile variables or memory mapped device registers.

'cache'
     Enable GDB to cache target memory.
'nocache'
     Disable GDB from caching target memory.  This is the default.

10.17.2 Memory Access Checking
------------------------------

GDB can be instructed to refuse accesses to memory that is not
explicitly described.  This can be useful if accessing such regions has
undesired effects for a specific target, or to provide better error
checking.  The following commands control this behaviour.

'set mem inaccessible-by-default [on|off]'
     If 'on' is specified, make GDB treat memory not explicitly
     described by the memory ranges as non-existent and refuse accesses
     to such memory.  The checks are only performed if there's at least
     one memory range defined.  If 'off' is specified, make GDB treat
     the memory not explicitly described by the memory ranges as RAM.
     The default value is 'on'.
'show mem inaccessible-by-default'
     Show the current handling of accesses to unknown memory.

10.18 Copy Between Memory and a File
====================================

You can use the commands 'dump', 'append', and 'restore' to copy data
between target memory and a file.  The 'dump' and 'append' commands
write data to a file, and the 'restore' command reads data from a file
back into the inferior's memory.  Files may be in binary, Motorola
S-record, Intel hex, or Tektronix Hex format; however, GDB can only
append to binary files.

'dump [FORMAT] memory FILENAME START_ADDR END_ADDR'
'dump [FORMAT] value FILENAME EXPR'
     Dump the contents of memory from START_ADDR to END_ADDR, or the
     value of EXPR, to FILENAME in the given format.

     The FORMAT parameter may be any one of:
     'binary'
          Raw binary form.
     'ihex'
          Intel hex format.
     'srec'
          Motorola S-record format.
     'tekhex'
          Tektronix Hex format.

     GDB uses the same definitions of these formats as the GNU binary
     utilities, like 'objdump' and 'objcopy'.  If FORMAT is omitted, GDB
     dumps the data in raw binary form.

'append [binary] memory FILENAME START_ADDR END_ADDR'
'append [binary] value FILENAME EXPR'
     Append the contents of memory from START_ADDR to END_ADDR, or the
     value of EXPR, to the file FILENAME, in raw binary form.  (GDB can
     only append data to files in raw binary form.)

'restore FILENAME [binary] BIAS START END'
     Restore the contents of file FILENAME into memory.  The 'restore'
     command can automatically recognize any known BFD file format,
     except for raw binary.  To restore a raw binary file you must
     specify the optional keyword 'binary' after the filename.

     If BIAS is non-zero, its value will be added to the addresses
     contained in the file.  Binary files always start at address zero,
     so they will be restored at address BIAS.  Other bfd files have a
     built-in location; they will be restored at offset BIAS from that
     location.

     If START and/or END are non-zero, then only data between file
     offset START and file offset END will be restored.  These offsets
     are relative to the addresses in the file, before the BIAS argument
     is applied.

10.19 How to Produce a Core File from Your Program
==================================================

A "core file" or "core dump" is a file that records the memory image of
a running process and its process status (register values etc.).  Its
primary use is post-mortem debugging of a program that crashed while it
ran outside a debugger.  A program that crashes automatically produces a
core file, unless this feature is disabled by the user.  *Note Files::,
for information on invoking GDB in the post-mortem debugging mode.

   Occasionally, you may wish to produce a core file of the program you
are debugging in order to preserve a snapshot of its state.  GDB has a
special command for that.

'generate-core-file [FILE]'
'gcore [FILE]'
     Produce a core dump of the inferior process.  The optional argument
     FILE specifies the file name where to put the core dump.  If not
     specified, the file name defaults to 'core.PID', where PID is the
     inferior process ID.

     Note that this command is implemented only for some systems (as of
     this writing, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and S390).


File: gdb.info,  Node: Character Sets,  Next: Caching Target Data,  Prev: Core File Generation,  Up: Data

10.20 Character Sets
====================

If the program you are debugging uses a different character set to
represent characters and strings than the one GDB uses itself, GDB can
automatically translate between the character sets for you.  The
character set GDB uses we call the "host character set"; the one the
inferior program uses we call the "target character set".

   For example, if you are running GDB on a GNU/Linux system, which uses
the ISO Latin 1 character set, but you are using GDB's remote protocol
(*note Remote Debugging::) to debug a program running on an IBM
mainframe, which uses the EBCDIC character set, then the host character
set is Latin-1, and the target character set is EBCDIC.  If you give GDB
the command 'set target-charset EBCDIC-US', then GDB translates between
EBCDIC and Latin 1 as you print character or string values, or use
character and string literals in expressions.

   GDB has no way to automatically recognize which character set the
inferior program uses; you must tell it, using the 'set target-charset'
command, described below.

   Here are the commands for controlling GDB's character set support:

'set target-charset CHARSET'
     Set the current target character set to CHARSET.  To display the
     list of supported target character sets, type
     'set target-charset <TAB><TAB>'.

'set host-charset CHARSET'
     Set the current host character set to CHARSET.

     By default, GDB uses a host character set appropriate to the system
     it is running on; you can override that default using the 'set
     host-charset' command.  On some systems, GDB cannot automatically
     determine the appropriate host character set.  In this case, GDB
     uses 'UTF-8'.

     GDB can only use certain character sets as its host character set.
     If you type 'set host-charset <TAB><TAB>', GDB will list the host
     character sets it supports.

'set charset CHARSET'
     Set the current host and target character sets to CHARSET.  As
     above, if you type 'set charset <TAB><TAB>', GDB will list the
     names of the character sets that can be used for both host and
     target.

'show charset'
     Show the names of the current host and target character sets.

'show host-charset'
     Show the name of the current host character set.

'show target-charset'
     Show the name of the current target character set.

'set target-wide-charset CHARSET'
     Set the current target's wide character set to CHARSET.  This is
     the character set used by the target's 'wchar_t' type.  To display
     the list of supported wide character sets, type
     'set target-wide-charset <TAB><TAB>'.

'show target-wide-charset'
     Show the name of the current target's wide character set.

   Here is an example of GDB's character set support in action.  Assume
that the following source code has been placed in the file
'charset-test.c':

     #include <stdio.h>

     char ascii_hello[]
       = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119,
          111, 114, 108, 100, 33, 10, 0};
     char ibm1047_hello[]
       = {200, 133, 147, 147, 150, 107, 64, 166,
          150, 153, 147, 132, 90, 37, 0};

     main ()
     {
       printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     }

   In this program, 'ascii_hello' and 'ibm1047_hello' are arrays
containing the string 'Hello, world!' followed by a newline, encoded in
the ASCII and IBM1047 character sets.

   We compile the program, and invoke the debugger on it:

     $ gcc -g charset-test.c -o charset-test
     $ gdb -nw charset-test
     GNU gdb 2001-12-19-cvs
     Copyright 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     ...
     (gdb)

   We can use the 'show charset' command to see what character sets GDB
is currently using to interpret and display characters and strings:

     (gdb) show charset
     The current host and target character set is `ISO-8859-1'.
     (gdb)

   For the sake of printing this manual, let's use ASCII as our initial
character set:
     (gdb) set charset ASCII
     (gdb) show charset
     The current host and target character set is `ASCII'.
     (gdb)

   Let's assume that ASCII is indeed the correct character set for our
host system -- in other words, let's assume that if GDB prints
characters using the ASCII character set, our terminal will display them
properly.  Since our current target character set is also ASCII, the
contents of 'ascii_hello' print legibly:

     (gdb) print ascii_hello
     $1 = 0x401698 "Hello, world!\n"
     (gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
     $2 = 72 'H'
     (gdb)

   GDB uses the target character set for character and string literals
you use in expressions:

     (gdb) print '+'
     $3 = 43 '+'
     (gdb)

   The ASCII character set uses the number 43 to encode the '+'
character.

   GDB relies on the user to tell it which character set the target
program uses.  If we print 'ibm1047_hello' while our target character
set is still ASCII, we get jibberish:

     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello
     $4 = 0x4016a8 "\310\205\223\223\226k@\246\226\231\223\204Z%"
     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
     $5 = 200 '\310'
     (gdb)

   If we invoke the 'set target-charset' followed by <TAB><TAB>, GDB
tells us the character sets it supports:

     (gdb) set target-charset
     ASCII       EBCDIC-US   IBM1047     ISO-8859-1
     (gdb) set target-charset

   We can select IBM1047 as our target character set, and examine the
program's strings again.  Now the ASCII string is wrong, but GDB
translates the contents of 'ibm1047_hello' from the target character
set, IBM1047, to the host character set, ASCII, and they display
correctly:

     (gdb) set target-charset IBM1047
     (gdb) show charset
     The current host character set is `ASCII'.
     The current target character set is `IBM1047'.
     (gdb) print ascii_hello
     $6 = 0x401698 "\110\145%%?\054\040\167?\162%\144\041\012"
     (gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
     $7 = 72 '\110'
     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello
     $8 = 0x4016a8 "Hello, world!\n"
     (gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
     $9 = 200 'H'
     (gdb)

   As above, GDB uses the target character set for character and string
literals you use in expressions:

     (gdb) print '+'
     $10 = 78 '+'
     (gdb)

   The IBM1047 character set uses the number 78 to encode the '+'
character.

10.21 Caching Data of Targets
=============================

GDB caches data exchanged between the debugger and a target.  Each cache
is associated with the address space of the inferior.  *Note Inferiors
and Programs::, about inferior and address space.  Such caching
generally improves performance in remote debugging (*note Remote
Debugging::), because it reduces the overhead of the remote protocol by
bundling memory reads and writes into large chunks.  Unfortunately,
simply caching everything would lead to incorrect results, since GDB
does not necessarily know anything about volatile values, memory-mapped
I/O addresses, etc.  Furthermore, in non-stop mode (*note Non-Stop
Mode::) memory can be changed _while_ a gdb command is executing.
Therefore, by default, GDB only caches data known to be on the stack(1)
or in the code segment.  Other regions of memory can be explicitly
marked as cacheable; *note Memory Region Attributes::.

'set remotecache on'
'set remotecache off'
     This option no longer does anything; it exists for compatibility
     with old scripts.

'show remotecache'
     Show the current state of the obsolete remotecache flag.

'set stack-cache on'
'set stack-cache off'
     Enable or disable caching of stack accesses.  When 'on', use
     caching.  By default, this option is 'on'.

'show stack-cache'
     Show the current state of data caching for memory accesses.

'set code-cache on'
'set code-cache off'
     Enable or disable caching of code segment accesses.  When 'on', use
     caching.  By default, this option is 'on'.  This improves
     performance of disassembly in remote debugging.

'show code-cache'
     Show the current state of target memory cache for code segment
     accesses.

'info dcache [line]'
     Print the information about the performance of data cache of the
     current inferior's address space.  The information displayed
     includes the dcache width and depth, and for each cache line, its
     number, address, and how many times it was referenced.  This
     command is useful for debugging the data cache operation.

     If a line number is specified, the contents of that line will be
     printed in hex.

'set dcache size SIZE'
     Set maximum number of entries in dcache (dcache depth above).

'set dcache line-size LINE-SIZE'
     Set number of bytes each dcache entry caches (dcache width above).
     Must be a power of 2.

'show dcache size'
     Show maximum number of dcache entries.  *Note info dcache: Caching
     Target Data.

'show dcache line-size'
     Show default size of dcache lines.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In non-stop mode, it is moderately rare for a running thread to
modify the stack of a stopped thread in a way that would interfere with
a backtrace, and caching of stack reads provides a significant speed up
of remote backtraces.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Searching Memory,  Prev: Caching Target Data,  Up: Data

10.22 Search Memory
===================

Memory can be searched for a particular sequence of bytes with the
'find' command.

'find [/SN] START_ADDR, +LEN, VAL1 [, VAL2, ...]'
'find [/SN] START_ADDR, END_ADDR, VAL1 [, VAL2, ...]'
     Search memory for the sequence of bytes specified by VAL1, VAL2,
     etc.  The search begins at address START_ADDR and continues for
     either LEN bytes or through to END_ADDR inclusive.

   S and N are optional parameters.  They may be specified in either
order, apart or together.

S, search query size
     The size of each search query value.

     'b'
          bytes
     'h'
          halfwords (two bytes)
     'w'
          words (four bytes)
     'g'
          giant words (eight bytes)

     All values are interpreted in the current language.  This means,
     for example, that if the current source language is C/C++ then
     searching for the string "hello" includes the trailing '\0'.

     If the value size is not specified, it is taken from the value's
     type in the current language.  This is useful when one wants to
     specify the search pattern as a mixture of types.  Note that this
     means, for example, that in the case of C-like languages a search
     for an untyped 0x42 will search for '(int) 0x42' which is typically
     four bytes.

N, maximum number of finds
     The maximum number of matches to print.  The default is to print
     all finds.

   You can use strings as search values.  Quote them with double-quotes
('"').  The string value is copied into the search pattern byte by byte,
regardless of the endianness of the target and the size specification.

   The address of each match found is printed as well as a count of the
number of matches found.

   The address of the last value found is stored in convenience variable
'$_'.  A count of the number of matches is stored in '$numfound'.

   For example, if stopped at the 'printf' in this function:

     void
     hello ()
     {
       static char hello[] = "hello-hello";
       static struct { char c; short s; int i; }
         __attribute__ ((packed)) mixed
         = { 'c', 0x1234, 0x87654321 };
       printf ("%s\n", hello);
     }

you get during debugging:

     (gdb) find &hello[0], +sizeof(hello), "hello"
     0x804956d <hello.1620+6>
     1 pattern found
     (gdb) find &hello[0], +sizeof(hello), 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'
     0x8049567 <hello.1620>
     0x804956d <hello.1620+6>
     2 patterns found
     (gdb) find /b1 &hello[0], +sizeof(hello), 'h', 0x65, 'l'
     0x8049567 <hello.1620>
     1 pattern found
     (gdb) find &mixed, +sizeof(mixed), (char) 'c', (short) 0x1234, (int) 0x87654321
     0x8049560 <mixed.1625>
     1 pattern found
     (gdb) print $numfound
     $1 = 1
     (gdb) print $_
     $2 = (void *) 0x8049560

11 Debugging Optimized Code
***************************

Almost all compilers support optimization.  With optimization disabled,
the compiler generates assembly code that corresponds directly to your
source code, in a simplistic way.  As the compiler applies more powerful
optimizations, the generated assembly code diverges from your original
source code.  With help from debugging information generated by the
compiler, GDB can map from the running program back to constructs from
your original source.

   GDB is more accurate with optimization disabled.  If you can
recompile without optimization, it is easier to follow the progress of
your program during debugging.  But, there are many cases where you may
need to debug an optimized version.

   When you debug a program compiled with '-g -O', remember that the
optimizer has rearranged your code; the debugger shows you what is
really there.  Do not be too surprised when the execution path does not
exactly match your source file!  An extreme example: if you define a
variable, but never use it, GDB never sees that variable--because the
compiler optimizes it out of existence.

   Some things do not work as well with '-g -O' as with just '-g',
particularly on machines with instruction scheduling.  If in doubt,
recompile with '-g' alone, and if this fixes the problem, please report
it to us as a bug (including a test case!).  *Note Variables::, for more
information about debugging optimized code.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Inline Functions,  Next: Tail Call Frames,  Up: Optimized Code

11.1 Inline Functions
=====================

"Inlining" is an optimization that inserts a copy of the function body
directly at each call site, instead of jumping to a shared routine.  GDB
displays inlined functions just like non-inlined functions.  They appear
in backtraces.  You can view their arguments and local variables, step
into them with 'step', skip them with 'next', and escape from them with
'finish'.  You can check whether a function was inlined by using the
'info frame' command.

   For GDB to support inlined functions, the compiler must record
information about inlining in the debug information -- GCC using the
DWARF 2 format does this, and several other compilers do also.  GDB only
supports inlined functions when using DWARF 2.  Versions of GCC before
4.1 do not emit two required attributes ('DW_AT_call_file' and
'DW_AT_call_line'); GDB does not display inlined function calls with
earlier versions of GCC.  It instead displays the arguments and local
variables of inlined functions as local variables in the caller.

   The body of an inlined function is directly included at its call
site; unlike a non-inlined function, there are no instructions devoted
to the call.  GDB still pretends that the call site and the start of the
inlined function are different instructions.  Stepping to the call site
shows the call site, and then stepping again shows the first line of the
inlined function, even though no additional instructions are executed.

   This makes source-level debugging much clearer; you can see both the
context of the call and then the effect of the call.  Only stepping by a
single instruction using 'stepi' or 'nexti' does not do this; single
instruction steps always show the inlined body.

   There are some ways that GDB does not pretend that inlined function
calls are the same as normal calls:

   * Setting breakpoints at the call site of an inlined function may not
     work, because the call site does not contain any code.  GDB may
     incorrectly move the breakpoint to the next line of the enclosing
     function, after the call.  This limitation will be removed in a
     future version of GDB; until then, set a breakpoint on an earlier
     line or inside the inlined function instead.

   * GDB cannot locate the return value of inlined calls after using the
     'finish' command.  This is a limitation of compiler-generated
     debugging information; after 'finish', you can step to the next
     line and print a variable where your program stored the return
     value.

11.2 Tail Call Frames
=====================

Function 'B' can call function 'C' in its very last statement.  In
unoptimized compilation the call of 'C' is immediately followed by
return instruction at the end of 'B' code.  Optimizing compiler may
replace the call and return in function 'B' into one jump to function
'C' instead.  Such use of a jump instruction is called "tail call".

   During execution of function 'C', there will be no indication in the
function call stack frames that it was tail-called from 'B'.  If
function 'A' regularly calls function 'B' which tail-calls function 'C',
then GDB will see 'A' as the caller of 'C'.  However, in some cases GDB
can determine that 'C' was tail-called from 'B', and it will then create
fictitious call frame for that, with the return address set up as if 'B'
called 'C' normally.

   This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging
format and the compiler has to produce 'DW_TAG_GNU_call_site' tags.
With GCC, you need to specify '-O -g' during compilation, to get this
information.

   'info frame' command (*note Frame Info::) will indicate the tail call
frame kind by text 'tail call frame' such as in this sample GDB output:

     (gdb) x/i $pc - 2
        0x40066b <b(int, double)+11>: jmp 0x400640 <c(int, double)>
     (gdb) info frame
     Stack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffda30:
      rip = 0x40066d in b (amd64-entry-value.cc:59); saved rip 0x4004c5
      tail call frame, caller of frame at 0x7fffffffda30
      source language c++.
      Arglist at unknown address.
      Locals at unknown address, Previous frame's sp is 0x7fffffffda30

   The detection of all the possible code path executions can find them
ambiguous.  There is no execution history stored (possible *note Reverse
Execution:: is never used for this purpose) and the last known caller
could have reached the known callee by multiple different jump
sequences.  In such case GDB still tries to show at least all the
unambiguous top tail callers and all the unambiguous bottom tail calees,
if any.

'set debug entry-values'
     When set to on, enables printing of analysis messages for both
     frame argument values at function entry and tail calls.  It will
     show all the possible valid tail calls code paths it has
     considered.  It will also print the intersection of them with the
     final unambiguous (possibly partial or even empty) code path
     result.

'show debug entry-values'
     Show the current state of analysis messages printing for both frame
     argument values at function entry and tail calls.

   The analysis messages for tail calls can for example show why the
virtual tail call frame for function 'c' has not been recognized (due to
the indirect reference by variable 'x'):

     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void);
     void (*x) (void) = c;
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { x++; }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { a (); }
     int main (void) { x (); return 0; }

     Breakpoint 1, DW_OP_GNU_entry_value resolving cannot find
     DW_TAG_GNU_call_site 0x40039a in main
     a () at t.c:3
     3	static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { x++; }
     (gdb) bt
     #0  a () at t.c:3
     #1  0x000000000040039a in main () at t.c:5

   Another possibility is an ambiguous virtual tail call frames
resolution:

     int i;
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) f (void) { i++; }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) e (void) { f (); }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) d (void) { f (); }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { d (); }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (void)
     { if (i) c (); else e (); }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { b (); }
     int main (void) { a (); return 0; }

     tailcall: initial: 0x4004d2(a) 0x4004ce(b) 0x4004b2(c) 0x4004a2(d)
     tailcall: compare: 0x4004d2(a) 0x4004cc(b) 0x400492(e)
     tailcall: reduced: 0x4004d2(a) |
     (gdb) bt
     #0  f () at t.c:2
     #1  0x00000000004004d2 in a () at t.c:8
     #2  0x0000000000400395 in main () at t.c:9

   Frames #0 and #2 are real, #1 is a virtual tail call frame.  The code
can have possible execution paths 'main->a->b->c->d->f' or
'main->a->b->e->f', GDB cannot find which one from the inferior state.

   'initial:' state shows some random possible calling sequence GDB has
found.  It then finds another possible calling sequcen - that one is
prefixed by 'compare:'.  The non-ambiguous intersection of these two is
printed as the 'reduced:' calling sequence.  That one could have many
futher 'compare:' and 'reduced:' statements as long as there remain any
non-ambiguous sequence entries.

   For the frame of function 'b' in both cases there are different
possible '$pc' values ('0x4004cc' or '0x4004ce'), therefore this frame
is also ambigous.  The only non-ambiguous frame is the one for function
'a', therefore this one is displayed to the user while the ambiguous
frames are omitted.

   There can be also reasons why printing of frame argument values at
function entry may fail:

     int v;
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (int i) { v++; }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i);
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (int i) { a (i); }
     static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i)
     { if (i) b (i - 1); else c (0); }
     int main (void) { a (5); return 0; }

     (gdb) bt
     #0  c (i=i@entry=0) at t.c:2
     #1  0x0000000000400428 in a (DW_OP_GNU_entry_value resolving has found
     function "a" at 0x400420 can call itself via tail calls
     i=<optimized out>) at t.c:6
     #2  0x000000000040036e in main () at t.c:7

   GDB cannot find out from the inferior state if and how many times did
function 'a' call itself (via function 'b') as these calls would be tail
calls.  Such tail calls would modify thue 'i' variable, therefore GDB
cannot be sure the value it knows would be right - GDB prints
'<optimized out>' instead.

12 C Preprocessor Macros
************************

Some languages, such as C and C++, provide a way to define and invoke
"preprocessor macros" which expand into strings of tokens.  GDB can
evaluate expressions containing macro invocations, show the result of
macro expansion, and show a macro's definition, including where it was
defined.

   You may need to compile your program specially to provide GDB with
information about preprocessor macros.  Most compilers do not include
macros in their debugging information, even when you compile with the
'-g' flag.  *Note Compilation::.

   A program may define a macro at one point, remove that definition
later, and then provide a different definition after that.  Thus, at
different points in the program, a macro may have different definitions,
or have no definition at all.  If there is a current stack frame, GDB
uses the macros in scope at that frame's source code line.  Otherwise,
GDB uses the macros in scope at the current listing location; see *note
List::.

   Whenever GDB evaluates an expression, it always expands any macro
invocations present in the expression.  GDB also provides the following
commands for working with macros explicitly.

'macro expand EXPRESSION'
'macro exp EXPRESSION'
     Show the results of expanding all preprocessor macro invocations in
     EXPRESSION.  Since GDB simply expands macros, but does not parse
     the result, EXPRESSION need not be a valid expression; it can be
     any string of tokens.

'macro expand-once EXPRESSION'
'macro exp1 EXPRESSION'
     (This command is not yet implemented.)  Show the results of
     expanding those preprocessor macro invocations that appear
     explicitly in EXPRESSION.  Macro invocations appearing in that
     expansion are left unchanged.  This command allows you to see the
     effect of a particular macro more clearly, without being confused
     by further expansions.  Since GDB simply expands macros, but does
     not parse the result, EXPRESSION need not be a valid expression; it
     can be any string of tokens.

'info macro [-a|-all] [--] MACRO'
     Show the current definition or all definitions of the named MACRO,
     and describe the source location or compiler command-line where
     that definition was established.  The optional double dash is to
     signify the end of argument processing and the beginning of MACRO
     for non C-like macros where the macro may begin with a hyphen.

'info macros LINESPEC'
     Show all macro definitions that are in effect at the location
     specified by LINESPEC, and describe the source location or compiler
     command-line where those definitions were established.

'macro define MACRO REPLACEMENT-LIST'
'macro define MACRO(ARGLIST) REPLACEMENT-LIST'
     Introduce a definition for a preprocessor macro named MACRO,
     invocations of which are replaced by the tokens given in
     REPLACEMENT-LIST.  The first form of this command defines an
     "object-like" macro, which takes no arguments; the second form
     defines a "function-like" macro, which takes the arguments given in
     ARGLIST.

     A definition introduced by this command is in scope in every
     expression evaluated in GDB, until it is removed with the 'macro
     undef' command, described below.  The definition overrides all
     definitions for MACRO present in the program being debugged, as
     well as any previous user-supplied definition.

'macro undef MACRO'
     Remove any user-supplied definition for the macro named MACRO.
     This command only affects definitions provided with the 'macro
     define' command, described above; it cannot remove definitions
     present in the program being debugged.

'macro list'
     List all the macros defined using the 'macro define' command.

   Here is a transcript showing the above commands in action.  First, we
show our source files:

     $ cat sample.c
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include "sample.h"

     #define M 42
     #define ADD(x) (M + x)

     main ()
     {
     #define N 28
       printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     #undef N
       printf ("We're so creative.\n");
     #define N 1729
       printf ("Goodbye, world!\n");
     }
     $ cat sample.h
     #define Q <
     $

   Now, we compile the program using the GNU C compiler, GCC.  We pass
the '-gdwarf-2'(1) _and_ '-g3' flags to ensure the compiler includes
information about preprocessor macros in the debugging information.

     $ gcc -gdwarf-2 -g3 sample.c -o sample
     $

   Now, we start GDB on our sample program:

     $ gdb -nw sample
     GNU gdb 2002-05-06-cvs
     Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     GDB is free software, ...
     (gdb)

   We can expand macros and examine their definitions, even when the
program is not running.  GDB uses the current listing position to decide
which macro definitions are in scope:

     (gdb) list main
     3
     4       #define M 42
     5       #define ADD(x) (M + x)
     6
     7       main ()
     8       {
     9       #define N 28
     10        printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     11      #undef N
     12        printf ("We're so creative.\n");
     (gdb) info macro ADD
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:5
     #define ADD(x) (M + x)
     (gdb) info macro Q
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.h:1
       included at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:2
     #define Q <
     (gdb) macro expand ADD(1)
     expands to: (42 + 1)
     (gdb) macro expand-once ADD(1)
     expands to: once (M + 1)
     (gdb)

   In the example above, note that 'macro expand-once' expands only the
macro invocation explicit in the original text -- the invocation of
'ADD' -- but does not expand the invocation of the macro 'M', which was
introduced by 'ADD'.

   Once the program is running, GDB uses the macro definitions in force
at the source line of the current stack frame:

     (gdb) break main
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048370: file sample.c, line 10.
     (gdb) run
     Starting program: /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample

     Breakpoint 1, main () at sample.c:10
     10        printf ("Hello, world!\n");
     (gdb)

   At line 10, the definition of the macro 'N' at line 9 is in force:

     (gdb) info macro N
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:9
     #define N 28
     (gdb) macro expand N Q M
     expands to: 28 < 42
     (gdb) print N Q M
     $1 = 1
     (gdb)

   As we step over directives that remove 'N''s definition, and then
give it a new definition, GDB finds the definition (or lack thereof) in
force at each point:

     (gdb) next
     Hello, world!
     12        printf ("We're so creative.\n");
     (gdb) info macro N
     The symbol `N' has no definition as a C/C++ preprocessor macro
     at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:12
     (gdb) next
     We're so creative.
     14        printf ("Goodbye, world!\n");
     (gdb) info macro N
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:13
     #define N 1729
     (gdb) macro expand N Q M
     expands to: 1729 < 42
     (gdb) print N Q M
     $2 = 0
     (gdb)

   In addition to source files, macros can be defined on the compilation
command line using the '-DNAME=VALUE' syntax.  For macros defined in
such a way, GDB displays the location of their definition as line zero
of the source file submitted to the compiler.

     (gdb) info macro __STDC__
     Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:0
     -D__STDC__=1
     (gdb)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is the minimum.  Recent versions of GCC support '-gdwarf-3'
and '-gdwarf-4'; we recommend always choosing the most recent version of
DWARF.

13 Tracepoints
**************

In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program's execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to change its behavior drastically, or perhaps fail, even when
the code itself is correct.  It is useful to be able to observe the
program's behavior without interrupting it.

   Using GDB's 'trace' and 'collect' commands, you can specify locations
in the program, called "tracepoints", and arbitrary expressions to
evaluate when those tracepoints are reached.  Later, using the 'tfind'
command, you can examine the values those expressions had when the
program hit the tracepoints.  The expressions may also denote objects in
memory--structures or arrays, for example--whose values GDB should
record; while visiting a particular tracepoint, you may inspect those
objects as if they were in memory at that moment.  However, because GDB
records these values without interacting with you, it can do so quickly
and unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program's behavior.

   The tracepoint facility is currently available only for remote
targets.  *Note Targets::.  In addition, your remote target must know
how to collect trace data.  This functionality is implemented in the
remote stub; however, none of the stubs distributed with GDB support
tracepoints as of this writing.  The format of the remote packets used
to implement tracepoints are described in *note Tracepoint Packets::.

   It is also possible to get trace data from a file, in a manner
reminiscent of corefiles; you specify the filename, and use 'tfind' to
search through the file.  *Note Trace Files::, for more details.

   This chapter describes the tracepoint commands and features.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Set Tracepoints,  Next: Analyze Collected Data,  Up: Tracepoints

13.1 Commands to Set Tracepoints
================================

Before running such a "trace experiment", an arbitrary number of
tracepoints can be set.  A tracepoint is actually a special type of
breakpoint (*note Set Breaks::), so you can manipulate it using standard
breakpoint commands.  For instance, as with breakpoints, tracepoint
numbers are successive integers starting from one, and many of the
commands associated with tracepoints take the tracepoint number as their
argument, to identify which tracepoint to work on.

   For each tracepoint, you can specify, in advance, some arbitrary set
of data that you want the target to collect in the trace buffer when it
hits that tracepoint.  The collected data can include registers, local
variables, or global data.  Later, you can use GDB commands to examine
the values these data had at the time the tracepoint was hit.

   Tracepoints do not support every breakpoint feature.  Ignore counts
on tracepoints have no effect, and tracepoints cannot run GDB commands
when they are hit.  Tracepoints may not be thread-specific either.

   Some targets may support "fast tracepoints", which are inserted in a
different way (such as with a jump instead of a trap), that is faster
but possibly restricted in where they may be installed.

   Regular and fast tracepoints are dynamic tracing facilities, meaning
that they can be used to insert tracepoints at (almost) any location in
the target.  Some targets may also support controlling "static
tracepoints" from GDB.  With static tracing, a set of instrumentation
points, also known as "markers", are embedded in the target program, and
can be activated or deactivated by name or address.  These are usually
placed at locations which facilitate investigating what the target is
actually doing.  GDB's support for static tracing includes being able to
list instrumentation points, and attach them with GDB defined high level
tracepoints that expose the whole range of convenience of GDB's
tracepoints support.  Namely, support for collecting registers values
and values of global or local (to the instrumentation point) variables;
tracepoint conditions and trace state variables.  The act of installing
a GDB static tracepoint on an instrumentation point, or marker, is
referred to as "probing" a static tracepoint marker.

   'gdbserver' supports tracepoints on some target systems.  *Note
Tracepoints support in 'gdbserver': Server.

conditions and actions.

13.1.1 Create and Delete Tracepoints
------------------------------------

'trace LOCATION'
     The 'trace' command is very similar to the 'break' command.  Its
     argument LOCATION can be a source line, a function name, or an
     address in the target program.  *Note Specify Location::.  The
     'trace' command defines a tracepoint, which is a point in the
     target program where the debugger will briefly stop, collect some
     data, and then allow the program to continue.  Setting a tracepoint
     or changing its actions takes effect immediately if the remote stub
     supports the 'InstallInTrace' feature (*note install tracepoint in
     tracing::).  If remote stub doesn't support the 'InstallInTrace'
     feature, all these changes don't take effect until the next
     'tstart' command, and once a trace experiment is running, further
     changes will not have any effect until the next trace experiment
     starts.  In addition, GDB supports "pending
     tracepoints"--tracepoints whose address is not yet resolved.  (This
     is similar to pending breakpoints.)  Pending tracepoints are not
     downloaded to the target and not installed until they are resolved.
     The resolution of pending tracepoints requires GDB support--when
     debugging with the remote target, and GDB disconnects from the
     remote stub (*note disconnected tracing::), pending tracepoints can
     not be resolved (and downloaded to the remote stub) while GDB is
     disconnected.

     Here are some examples of using the 'trace' command:

          (gdb) trace foo.c:121    // a source file and line number

          (gdb) trace +2           // 2 lines forward

          (gdb) trace my_function  // first source line of function

          (gdb) trace *my_function // EXACT start address of function

          (gdb) trace *0x2117c4    // an address

     You can abbreviate 'trace' as 'tr'.

'trace LOCATION if COND'
     Set a tracepoint with condition COND; evaluate the expression COND
     each time the tracepoint is reached, and collect data only if the
     value is nonzero--that is, if COND evaluates as true.  *Note
     Tracepoint Conditions: Tracepoint Conditions, for more information
     on tracepoint conditions.

'ftrace LOCATION [ if COND ]'
     The 'ftrace' command sets a fast tracepoint.  For targets that
     support them, fast tracepoints will use a more efficient but
     possibly less general technique to trigger data collection, such as
     a jump instruction instead of a trap, or some sort of hardware
     support.  It may not be possible to create a fast tracepoint at the
     desired location, in which case the command will exit with an
     explanatory message.

     GDB handles arguments to 'ftrace' exactly as for 'trace'.

     On 32-bit x86-architecture systems, fast tracepoints normally need
     to be placed at an instruction that is 5 bytes or longer, but can
     be placed at 4-byte instructions if the low 64K of memory of the
     target program is available to install trampolines.  Some Unix-type
     systems, such as GNU/Linux, exclude low addresses from the
     program's address space; but for instance with the Linux kernel it
     is possible to let GDB use this area by doing a 'sysctl' command to
     set the 'mmap_min_addr' kernel parameter, as in

          sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=32768

     which sets the low address to 32K, which leaves plenty of room for
     trampolines.  The minimum address should be set to a page boundary.

'strace LOCATION [ if COND ]'
     The 'strace' command sets a static tracepoint.  For targets that
     support it, setting a static tracepoint probes a static
     instrumentation point, or marker, found at LOCATION.  It may not be
     possible to set a static tracepoint at the desired location, in
     which case the command will exit with an explanatory message.

     GDB handles arguments to 'strace' exactly as for 'trace', with the
     addition that the user can also specify '-m MARKER' as LOCATION.
     This probes the marker identified by the MARKER string identifier.
     This identifier depends on the static tracepoint backend library
     your program is using.  You can find all the marker identifiers in
     the 'ID' field of the 'info static-tracepoint-markers' command
     output.  *Note Listing Static Tracepoint Markers: Listing Static
     Tracepoint Markers.  For example, in the following small program
     using the UST tracing engine:

          main ()
          {
            trace_mark(ust, bar33, "str %s", "FOOBAZ");
          }

     the marker id is composed of joining the first two arguments to the
     'trace_mark' call with a slash, which translates to:

          (gdb) info static-tracepoint-markers
          Cnt Enb ID         Address            What
          1   n   ust/bar33  0x0000000000400ddc in main at stexample.c:22
                   Data: "str %s"
          [etc...]

     so you may probe the marker above with:

          (gdb) strace -m ust/bar33

     Static tracepoints accept an extra collect action -- 'collect
     $_sdata'.  This collects arbitrary user data passed in the probe
     point call to the tracing library.  In the UST example above,
     you'll see that the third argument to 'trace_mark' is a printf-like
     format string.  The user data is then the result of running that
     formating string against the following arguments.  Note that 'info
     static-tracepoint-markers' command output lists that format string
     in the 'Data:' field.

     You can inspect this data when analyzing the trace buffer, by
     printing the $_sdata variable like any other variable available to
     GDB.  *Note Tracepoint Action Lists: Tracepoint Actions.

     The convenience variable '$tpnum' records the tracepoint number of
     the most recently set tracepoint.

'delete tracepoint [NUM]'
     Permanently delete one or more tracepoints.  With no argument, the
     default is to delete all tracepoints.  Note that the regular
     'delete' command can remove tracepoints also.

     Examples:

          (gdb) delete trace 1 2 3 // remove three tracepoints

          (gdb) delete trace       // remove all tracepoints

     You can abbreviate this command as 'del tr'.

13.1.2 Enable and Disable Tracepoints
-------------------------------------

These commands are deprecated; they are equivalent to plain 'disable'
and 'enable'.

'disable tracepoint [NUM]'
     Disable tracepoint NUM, or all tracepoints if no argument NUM is
     given.  A disabled tracepoint will have no effect during a trace
     experiment, but it is not forgotten.  You can re-enable a disabled
     tracepoint using the 'enable tracepoint' command.  If the command
     is issued during a trace experiment and the debug target has
     support for disabling tracepoints during a trace experiment, then
     the change will be effective immediately.  Otherwise, it will be
     applied to the next trace experiment.

'enable tracepoint [NUM]'
     Enable tracepoint NUM, or all tracepoints.  If this command is
     issued during a trace experiment and the debug target supports
     enabling tracepoints during a trace experiment, then the enabled
     tracepoints will become effective immediately.  Otherwise, they
     will become effective the next time a trace experiment is run.

13.1.3 Tracepoint Passcounts
----------------------------

'passcount [N [NUM]]'
     Set the "passcount" of a tracepoint.  The passcount is a way to
     automatically stop a trace experiment.  If a tracepoint's passcount
     is N, then the trace experiment will be automatically stopped on
     the N'th time that tracepoint is hit.  If the tracepoint number NUM
     is not specified, the 'passcount' command sets the passcount of the
     most recently defined tracepoint.  If no passcount is given, the
     trace experiment will run until stopped explicitly by the user.

     Examples:

          (gdb) passcount 5 2 // Stop on the 5th execution of
                                        // tracepoint 2

          (gdb) passcount 12  // Stop on the 12th execution of the
                                        // most recently defined tracepoint.
          (gdb) trace foo
          (gdb) pass 3
          (gdb) trace bar
          (gdb) pass 2
          (gdb) trace baz
          (gdb) pass 1        // Stop tracing when foo has been
                                         // executed 3 times OR when bar has
                                         // been executed 2 times
                                         // OR when baz has been executed 1 time.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Tracepoint Conditions,  Next: Trace State Variables,  Prev: Tracepoint Passcounts,  Up: Set Tracepoints

13.1.4 Tracepoint Conditions
----------------------------

The simplest sort of tracepoint collects data every time your program
reaches a specified place.  You can also specify a "condition" for a
tracepoint.  A condition is just a Boolean expression in your
programming language (*note Expressions: Expressions.).  A tracepoint
with a condition evaluates the expression each time your program reaches
it, and data collection happens only if the condition is true.

   Tracepoint conditions can be specified when a tracepoint is set, by
using 'if' in the arguments to the 'trace' command.  *Note Setting
Tracepoints: Create and Delete Tracepoints.  They can also be set or
changed at any time with the 'condition' command, just as with
breakpoints.

   Unlike breakpoint conditions, GDB does not actually evaluate the
conditional expression itself.  Instead, GDB encodes the expression into
an agent expression (*note Agent Expressions::) suitable for execution
on the target, independently of GDB.  Global variables become raw memory
locations, locals become stack accesses, and so forth.

   For instance, suppose you have a function that is usually called
frequently, but should not be called after an error has occurred.  You
could use the following tracepoint command to collect data about calls
of that function that happen while the error code is propagating through
the program; an unconditional tracepoint could end up collecting
thousands of useless trace frames that you would have to search through.

     (gdb) trace normal_operation if errcode > 0

13.1.5 Trace State Variables
----------------------------

A "trace state variable" is a special type of variable that is created
and managed by target-side code.  The syntax is the same as that for
GDB's convenience variables (a string prefixed with "$"), but they are
stored on the target.  They must be created explicitly, using a
'tvariable' command.  They are always 64-bit signed integers.

   Trace state variables are remembered by GDB, and downloaded to the
target along with tracepoint information when the trace experiment
starts.  There are no intrinsic limits on the number of trace state
variables, beyond memory limitations of the target.

   Although trace state variables are managed by the target, you can use
them in print commands and expressions as if they were convenience
variables; GDB will get the current value from the target while the
trace experiment is running.  Trace state variables share the same
namespace as other "$" variables, which means that you cannot have trace
state variables with names like '$23' or '$pc', nor can you have a trace
state variable and a convenience variable with the same name.

'tvariable $NAME [ = EXPRESSION ]'
     The 'tvariable' command creates a new trace state variable named
     '$NAME', and optionally gives it an initial value of EXPRESSION.
     The EXPRESSION is evaluated when this command is entered; the
     result will be converted to an integer if possible, otherwise GDB
     will report an error.  A subsequent 'tvariable' command specifying
     the same name does not create a variable, but instead assigns the
     supplied initial value to the existing variable of that name,
     overwriting any previous initial value.  The default initial value
     is 0.

'info tvariables'
     List all the trace state variables along with their initial values.
     Their current values may also be displayed, if the trace experiment
     is currently running.

'delete tvariable [ $NAME ... ]'
     Delete the given trace state variables, or all of them if no
     arguments are specified.

13.1.6 Tracepoint Action Lists
------------------------------

'actions [NUM]'
     This command will prompt for a list of actions to be taken when the
     tracepoint is hit.  If the tracepoint number NUM is not specified,
     this command sets the actions for the one that was most recently
     defined (so that you can define a tracepoint and then say 'actions'
     without bothering about its number).  You specify the actions
     themselves on the following lines, one action at a time, and
     terminate the actions list with a line containing just 'end'.  So
     far, the only defined actions are 'collect', 'teval', and
     'while-stepping'.

     'actions' is actually equivalent to 'commands' (*note Breakpoint
     Command Lists: Break Commands.), except that only the defined
     actions are allowed; any other GDB command is rejected.

     To remove all actions from a tracepoint, type 'actions NUM' and
     follow it immediately with 'end'.

          (gdb) collect DATA // collect some data

          (gdb) while-stepping 5 // single-step 5 times, collect data

          (gdb) end              // signals the end of actions.

     In the following example, the action list begins with 'collect'
     commands indicating the things to be collected when the tracepoint
     is hit.  Then, in order to single-step and collect additional data
     following the tracepoint, a 'while-stepping' command is used,
     followed by the list of things to be collected after each step in a
     sequence of single steps.  The 'while-stepping' command is
     terminated by its own separate 'end' command.  Lastly, the action
     list is terminated by an 'end' command.

          (gdb) trace foo
          (gdb) actions
          Enter actions for tracepoint 1, one per line:
          > collect bar,baz
          > collect $regs
          > while-stepping 12
            > collect $pc, arr[i]
            > end
          end

'collect[/MODS] EXPR1, EXPR2, ...'
     Collect values of the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit.
     This command accepts a comma-separated list of any valid
     expressions.  In addition to global, static, or local variables,
     the following special arguments are supported:

     '$regs'
          Collect all registers.

     '$args'
          Collect all function arguments.

     '$locals'
          Collect all local variables.

     '$_ret'
          Collect the return address.  This is helpful if you want to
          see more of a backtrace.

     '$_probe_argc'
          Collects the number of arguments from the static probe at
          which the tracepoint is located.  *Note Static Probe Points::.

     '$_probe_argN'
          N is an integer between 0 and 11.  Collects the Nth argument
          from the static probe at which the tracepoint is located.
          *Note Static Probe Points::.

     '$_sdata'
          Collect static tracepoint marker specific data.  Only
          available for static tracepoints.  *Note Tracepoint Action
          Lists: Tracepoint Actions.  On the UST static tracepoints
          library backend, an instrumentation point resembles a 'printf'
          function call.  The tracing library is able to collect user
          specified data formatted to a character string using the
          format provided by the programmer that instrumented the
          program.  Other backends have similar mechanisms.  Here's an
          example of a UST marker call:

                const char master_name[] = "$your_name";
                trace_mark(channel1, marker1, "hello %s", master_name)

          In this case, collecting '$_sdata' collects the string 'hello
          $yourname'.  When analyzing the trace buffer, you can inspect
          '$_sdata' like any other variable available to GDB.

     You can give several consecutive 'collect' commands, each one with
     a single argument, or one 'collect' command with several arguments
     separated by commas; the effect is the same.

     The optional MODS changes the usual handling of the arguments.  's'
     requests that pointers to chars be handled as strings, in
     particular collecting the contents of the memory being pointed at,
     up to the first zero.  The upper bound is by default the value of
     the 'print elements' variable; if 's' is followed by a decimal
     number, that is the upper bound instead.  So for instance
     'collect/s25 mystr' collects as many as 25 characters at 'mystr'.

     The command 'info scope' (*note info scope: Symbols.) is
     particularly useful for figuring out what data to collect.

'teval EXPR1, EXPR2, ...'
     Evaluate the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit.  This
     command accepts a comma-separated list of expressions.  The results
     are discarded, so this is mainly useful for assigning values to
     trace state variables (*note Trace State Variables::) without
     adding those values to the trace buffer, as would be the case if
     the 'collect' action were used.

'while-stepping N'
     Perform N single-step instruction traces after the tracepoint,
     collecting new data after each step.  The 'while-stepping' command
     is followed by the list of what to collect while stepping (followed
     by its own 'end' command):

          > while-stepping 12
            > collect $regs, myglobal
            > end
          >

     Note that '$pc' is not automatically collected by 'while-stepping';
     you need to explicitly collect that register if you need it.  You
     may abbreviate 'while-stepping' as 'ws' or 'stepping'.

'set default-collect EXPR1, EXPR2, ...'
     This variable is a list of expressions to collect at each
     tracepoint hit.  It is effectively an additional 'collect' action
     prepended to every tracepoint action list.  The expressions are
     parsed individually for each tracepoint, so for instance a variable
     named 'xyz' may be interpreted as a global for one tracepoint, and
     a local for another, as appropriate to the tracepoint's location.

'show default-collect'
     Show the list of expressions that are collected by default at each
     tracepoint hit.

13.1.7 Listing Tracepoints
--------------------------

'info tracepoints [NUM...]'
     Display information about the tracepoint NUM.  If you don't specify
     a tracepoint number, displays information about all the tracepoints
     defined so far.  The format is similar to that used for 'info
     breakpoints'; in fact, 'info tracepoints' is the same command,
     simply restricting itself to tracepoints.

     A tracepoint's listing may include additional information specific
     to tracing:

        * its passcount as given by the 'passcount N' command

        * the state about installed on target of each location

          (gdb) info trace
          Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
          1       tracepoint     keep y   0x0804ab57 in foo() at main.cxx:7
                  while-stepping 20
                    collect globfoo, $regs
                  end
                  collect globfoo2
                  end
                  pass count 1200
          2       tracepoint     keep y   <MULTIPLE>
                  collect $eip
          2.1                         y     0x0804859c in func4 at change-loc.h:35
                  installed on target
          2.2                         y     0xb7ffc480 in func4 at change-loc.h:35
                  installed on target
          2.3                         y     <PENDING>  set_tracepoint

                  not installed on target
          (gdb)

     This command can be abbreviated 'info tp'.

13.1.8 Listing Static Tracepoint Markers
----------------------------------------

'info static-tracepoint-markers'
     Display information about all static tracepoint markers defined in
     the program.

     For each marker, the following columns are printed:

     _Count_
          An incrementing counter, output to help readability.  This is
          not a stable identifier.
     _ID_
          The marker ID, as reported by the target.
     _Enabled or Disabled_
          Probed markers are tagged with 'y'.  'n' identifies marks that
          are not enabled.
     _Address_
          Where the marker is in your program, as a memory address.
     _What_
          Where the marker is in the source for your program, as a file
          and line number.  If the debug information included in the
          program does not allow GDB to locate the source of the marker,
          this column will be left blank.

     In addition, the following information may be printed for each
     marker:

     _Data_
          User data passed to the tracing library by the marker call.
          In the UST backend, this is the format string passed as
          argument to the marker call.
     _Static tracepoints probing the marker_
          The list of static tracepoints attached to the marker.

          (gdb) info static-tracepoint-markers
          Cnt ID         Enb Address            What

13.1.9 Starting and Stopping Trace Experiments
----------------------------------------------

'tstart'
     This command starts the trace experiment, and begins collecting
     data.  It has the side effect of discarding all the data collected
     in the trace buffer during the previous trace experiment.  If any
     arguments are supplied, they are taken as a note and stored with
     the trace experiment's state.  The notes may be arbitrary text, and
     are especially useful with disconnected tracing in a multi-user
     context; the notes can explain what the trace is doing, supply user
     contact information, and so forth.

'tstop'
     This command stops the trace experiment.  If any arguments are
     supplied, they are recorded with the experiment as a note.  This is
     useful if you are stopping a trace started by someone else, for
     instance if the trace is interfering with the system's behavior and
     needs to be stopped quickly.

     *Note*: a trace experiment and data collection may stop
     automatically if any tracepoint's passcount is reached (*note
     Tracepoint Passcounts::), or if the trace buffer becomes full.

'tstatus'
     This command displays the status of the current trace data
     collection.

   Here is an example of the commands we described so far:

     (gdb) trace gdb_c_test
     (gdb) actions
     Enter actions for tracepoint #1, one per line.
     > collect $regs,$locals,$args
     > while-stepping 11
       > collect $regs
       > end
     > end
     (gdb) tstart
     	[time passes ...]
     (gdb) tstop

   You can choose to continue running the trace experiment even if GDB
disconnects from the target, voluntarily or involuntarily.  For commands
such as 'detach', the debugger will ask what you want to do with the
trace.  But for unexpected terminations (GDB crash, network outage), it
would be unfortunate to lose hard-won trace data, so the variable
'disconnected-tracing' lets you decide whether the trace should continue
running without GDB.

'set disconnected-tracing on'
'set disconnected-tracing off'
     Choose whether a tracing run should continue to run if GDB has
     disconnected from the target.  Note that 'detach' or 'quit' will
     ask you directly what to do about a running trace no matter what
     this variable's setting, so the variable is mainly useful for
     handling unexpected situations, such as loss of the network.

'show disconnected-tracing'
     Show the current choice for disconnected tracing.

   When you reconnect to the target, the trace experiment may or may not
still be running; it might have filled the trace buffer in the meantime,
or stopped for one of the other reasons.  If it is running, it will
continue after reconnection.

   Upon reconnection, the target will upload information about the
tracepoints in effect.  GDB will then compare that information to the
set of tracepoints currently defined, and attempt to match them up,
allowing for the possibility that the numbers may have changed due to
creation and deletion in the meantime.  If one of the target's
tracepoints does not match any in GDB, the debugger will create a new
tracepoint, so that you have a number with which to specify that
tracepoint.  This matching-up process is necessarily heuristic, and it
may result in useless tracepoints being created; you may simply delete
them if they are of no use.

   If your target agent supports a "circular trace buffer", then you can
run a trace experiment indefinitely without filling the trace buffer;
when space runs out, the agent deletes already-collected trace frames,
oldest first, until there is enough room to continue collecting.  This
is especially useful if your tracepoints are being hit too often, and
your trace gets terminated prematurely because the buffer is full.  To
ask for a circular trace buffer, simply set 'circular-trace-buffer' to
on.  You can set this at any time, including during tracing; if the
agent can do it, it will change buffer handling on the fly, otherwise it
will not take effect until the next run.

'set circular-trace-buffer on'
'set circular-trace-buffer off'
     Choose whether a tracing run should use a linear or circular buffer
     for trace data.  A linear buffer will not lose any trace data, but
     may fill up prematurely, while a circular buffer will discard old
     trace data, but it will have always room for the latest tracepoint
     hits.

'show circular-trace-buffer'
     Show the current choice for the trace buffer.  Note that this may
     not match the agent's current buffer handling, nor is it guaranteed
     to match the setting that might have been in effect during a past
     run, for instance if you are looking at frames from a trace file.

'set trace-buffer-size N'
'set trace-buffer-size unlimited'
     Request that the target use a trace buffer of N bytes.  Not all
     targets will honor the request; they may have a compiled-in size
     for the trace buffer, or some other limitation.  Set to a value of
     'unlimited' or '-1' to let the target use whatever size it likes.
     This is also the default.

'show trace-buffer-size'
     Show the current requested size for the trace buffer.  Note that
     this will only match the actual size if the target supports
     size-setting, and was able to handle the requested size.  For
     instance, if the target can only change buffer size between runs,
     this variable will not reflect the change until the next run
     starts.  Use 'tstatus' to get a report of the actual buffer size.

'set trace-user TEXT'

'show trace-user'

'set trace-notes TEXT'
     Set the trace run's notes.

'show trace-notes'
     Show the trace run's notes.

'set trace-stop-notes TEXT'
     Set the trace run's stop notes.  The handling of the note is as for
     'tstop' arguments; the set command is convenient way to fix a stop
     note that is mistaken or incomplete.

'show trace-stop-notes'
     Show the trace run's stop notes.

13.1.10 Tracepoint Restrictions
-------------------------------

There are a number of restrictions on the use of tracepoints.  As
described above, tracepoint data gathering occurs on the target without
interaction from GDB.  Thus the full capabilities of the debugger are
not available during data gathering, and then at data examination time,
you will be limited by only having what was collected.  The following
items describe some common problems, but it is not exhaustive, and you
may run into additional difficulties not mentioned here.

   * Tracepoint expressions are intended to gather objects (lvalues).
     Thus the full flexibility of GDB's expression evaluator is not
     available.  You cannot call functions, cast objects to aggregate
     types, access convenience variables or modify values (except by
     assignment to trace state variables).  Some language features may
     implicitly call functions (for instance Objective-C fields with
     accessors), and therefore cannot be collected either.

   * Collection of local variables, either individually or in bulk with
     '$locals' or '$args', during 'while-stepping' may behave
     erratically.  The stepping action may enter a new scope (for
     instance by stepping into a function), or the location of the
     variable may change (for instance it is loaded into a register).
     The tracepoint data recorded uses the location information for the
     variables that is correct for the tracepoint location.  When the
     tracepoint is created, it is not possible, in general, to determine
     where the steps of a 'while-stepping' sequence will advance the
     program--particularly if a conditional branch is stepped.

   * Collection of an incompletely-initialized or partially-destroyed
     object may result in something that GDB cannot display, or displays
     in a misleading way.

   * When GDB displays a pointer to character it automatically
     dereferences the pointer to also display characters of the string
     being pointed to.  However, collecting the pointer during tracing
     does not automatically collect the string.  You need to explicitly
     dereference the pointer and provide size information if you want to
     collect not only the pointer, but the memory pointed to.  For
     example, '*ptr@50' can be used to collect the 50 element array
     pointed to by 'ptr'.

   * It is not possible to collect a complete stack backtrace at a
     tracepoint.  Instead, you may collect the registers and a few
     hundred bytes from the stack pointer with something like
     '*(unsigned char *)$esp@300' (adjust to use the name of the actual
     stack pointer register on your target architecture, and the amount
     of stack you wish to capture).  Then the 'backtrace' command will
     show a partial backtrace when using a trace frame.  The number of
     stack frames that can be examined depends on the sizes of the
     frames in the collected stack.  Note that if you ask for a block so
     large that it goes past the bottom of the stack, the target agent
     may report an error trying to read from an invalid address.

   * If you do not collect registers at a tracepoint, GDB can infer that
     the value of '$pc' must be the same as the address of the
     tracepoint and use that when you are looking at a trace frame for
     that tracepoint.  However, this cannot work if the tracepoint has
     multiple locations (for instance if it was set in a function that
     was inlined), or if it has a 'while-stepping' loop.  In those cases
     GDB will warn you that it can't infer '$pc', and default it to
     zero.

13.2 Using the Collected Data
=============================

After the tracepoint experiment ends, you use GDB commands for examining
the trace data.  The basic idea is that each tracepoint collects a trace
"snapshot" every time it is hit and another snapshot every time it
single-steps.  All these snapshots are consecutively numbered from zero
and go into a buffer, and you can examine them later.  The way you
examine them is to "focus" on a specific trace snapshot.  When the
remote stub is focused on a trace snapshot, it will respond to all GDB
requests for memory and registers by reading from the buffer which
belongs to that snapshot, rather than from _real_ memory or registers of
the program being debugged.  This means that *all* GDB commands
('print', 'info registers', 'backtrace', etc.)  will behave as if we
were currently debugging the program state as it was when the tracepoint
occurred.  Any requests for data that are not in the buffer will fail.

13.2.1 'tfind N'
----------------

The basic command for selecting a trace snapshot from the buffer is
'tfind N', which finds trace snapshot number N, counting from zero.  If
no argument N is given, the next snapshot is selected.

   Here are the various forms of using the 'tfind' command.

'tfind start'
     Find the first snapshot in the buffer.  This is a synonym for
     'tfind 0' (since 0 is the number of the first snapshot).

'tfind none'
     Stop debugging trace snapshots, resume _live_ debugging.

'tfind end'
     Same as 'tfind none'.

'tfind'
     No argument means find the next trace snapshot.

'tfind -'
     Find the previous trace snapshot before the current one.  This
     permits retracing earlier steps.

'tfind tracepoint NUM'
     Find the next snapshot associated with tracepoint NUM.  Search
     proceeds forward from the last examined trace snapshot.  If no
     argument NUM is given, it means find the next snapshot collected
     for the same tracepoint as the current snapshot.

'tfind pc ADDR'
     Find the next snapshot associated with the value ADDR of the
     program counter.  Search proceeds forward from the last examined
     trace snapshot.  If no argument ADDR is given, it means find the
     next snapshot with the same value of PC as the current snapshot.

'tfind outside ADDR1, ADDR2'
     Find the next snapshot whose PC is outside the given range of
     addresses (exclusive).

'tfind range ADDR1, ADDR2'
     Find the next snapshot whose PC is between ADDR1 and ADDR2
     (inclusive).

'tfind line [FILE:]N'
     Find the next snapshot associated with the source line N.  If the
     optional argument FILE is given, refer to line N in that source
     file.  Search proceeds forward from the last examined trace
     snapshot.  If no argument N is given, it means find the next line
     other than the one currently being examined; thus saying 'tfind
     line' repeatedly can appear to have the same effect as stepping
     from line to line in a _live_ debugging session.

   The default arguments for the 'tfind' commands are specifically
designed to make it easy to scan through the trace buffer.  For
instance, 'tfind' with no argument selects the next trace snapshot, and
'tfind -' with no argument selects the previous trace snapshot.  So, by
giving one 'tfind' command, and then simply hitting <RET> repeatedly you
can examine all the trace snapshots in order.  Or, by saying 'tfind -'
and then hitting <RET> repeatedly you can examine the snapshots in
reverse order.  The 'tfind line' command with no argument selects the
snapshot for the next source line executed.  The 'tfind pc' command with
no argument selects the next snapshot with the same program counter (PC)
as the current frame.  The 'tfind tracepoint' command with no argument
selects the next trace snapshot collected by the same tracepoint as the
current one.

   In addition to letting you scan through the trace buffer manually,
these commands make it easy to construct GDB scripts that scan through
the trace buffer and print out whatever collected data you are
interested in.  Thus, if we want to examine the PC, FP, and SP registers
from each trace frame in the buffer, we can say this:

     (gdb) tfind start
     (gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
     > printf "Frame %d, PC = %08X, SP = %08X, FP = %08X\n", \
               $trace_frame, $pc, $sp, $fp
     > tfind
     > end

     Frame 0, PC = 0020DC64, SP = 0030BF3C, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 1, PC = 0020DC6C, SP = 0030BF38, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 2, PC = 0020DC70, SP = 0030BF34, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 3, PC = 0020DC74, SP = 0030BF30, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 4, PC = 0020DC78, SP = 0030BF2C, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 5, PC = 0020DC7C, SP = 0030BF28, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 6, PC = 0020DC80, SP = 0030BF24, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 7, PC = 0020DC84, SP = 0030BF20, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 8, PC = 0020DC88, SP = 0030BF1C, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 9, PC = 0020DC8E, SP = 0030BF18, FP = 0030BF44
     Frame 10, PC = 00203F6C, SP = 0030BE3C, FP = 0030BF14

   Or, if we want to examine the variable 'X' at each source line in the
buffer:

     (gdb) tfind start
     (gdb) while ($trace_frame != -1)
     > printf "Frame %d, X == %d\n", $trace_frame, X
     > tfind line
     > end

     Frame 0, X = 1
     Frame 7, X = 2
     Frame 13, X = 255

     (gdb)

   'tdump' works by scanning the tracepoint's current collection actions
and printing the value of each expression listed.  So 'tdump' can fail,
if after a run, you change the tracepoint's actions to mention variables
that were not collected during the run.

   Also, for tracepoints with 'while-stepping' loops, 'tdump' uses the
collected value of '$pc' to distinguish between trace frames that were
collected at the tracepoint hit, and frames that were collected while
stepping.  This allows it to correctly choose whether to display the
basic list of collections, or the collections from the body of the
while-stepping loop.  However, if '$pc' was not collected, then 'tdump'
will always attempt to dump using the basic collection list, and may
fail if a while-stepping frame does not include all the same data that
is collected at the tracepoint hit.

13.2.3 'save tracepoints FILENAME'
----------------------------------

This command saves all current tracepoint definitions together with
their actions and passcounts, into a file 'FILENAME' suitable for use in
a later debugging session.  To read the saved tracepoint definitions,
use the 'source' command (*note Command Files::).  The 'save-tracepoints'
command is a deprecated alias for 'save tracepoints'


File: gdb.info,  Node: Tracepoint Variables,  Next: Trace Files,  Prev: Analyze Collected Data,  Up: Tracepoints

13.3 Convenience Variables for Tracepoints
==========================================

'(int) $trace_frame'
     The current trace snapshot (a.k.a. "frame") number, or -1 if no
     snapshot is selected.

'(int) $tracepoint'
     The tracepoint for the current trace snapshot.

'(int) $trace_line'
     The line number for the current trace snapshot.

'(char []) $trace_file'
     The source file for the current trace snapshot.

'(char []) $trace_func'
     The name of the function containing '$tracepoint'.

   Note: '$trace_file' is not suitable for use in 'printf', use 'output'
instead.

   Here's a simple example of using these convenience variables for
stepping through all the trace snapshots and printing some of their
data.  Note that these are not the same as trace state variables, which
are managed by the target.

     (gdb) tfind start

     (gdb) while $trace_frame != -1
     > output $trace_file
     > printf ", line %d (tracepoint #%d)\n", $trace_line, $tracepoint
     > tfind
     > end

13.4 Using Trace Files
======================

In some situations, the target running a trace experiment may no longer
be available; perhaps it crashed, or the hardware was needed for a
different activity.  To handle these cases, you can arrange to dump the
trace data into a file, and later use that file as a source of trace
data, via the 'target tfile' command.

'tsave [ -r ] FILENAME'
'tsave [-ctf] DIRNAME'
     Save the trace data to FILENAME.  By default, this command assumes
     that FILENAME refers to the host filesystem, so if necessary GDB
     will copy raw trace data up from the target and then save it.  If
     the target supports it, you can also supply the optional argument
     '-r' ("remote") to direct the target to save the data directly into
     FILENAME in its own filesystem, which may be more efficient if the
     trace buffer is very large.  (Note, however, that 'target tfile'
     can only read from files accessible to the host.)  By default, this
     command will save trace frame in tfile format.  You can supply the
     optional argument '-ctf' to save date in CTF format.  The "Common
     Trace Format" (CTF) is proposed as a trace format that can be
     shared by multiple debugging and tracing tools.  Please go to
     'http://www.efficios.com/ctf' to get more information.

'target tfile FILENAME'
'target ctf DIRNAME'
     Use the file named FILENAME or directory named DIRNAME as a source
     of trace data.  Commands that examine data work as they do with a
     live target, but it is not possible to run any new trace
     experiments.  'tstatus' will report the state of the trace run at
     the moment the data was saved, as well as the current trace frame
     you are examining.  Both FILENAME and DIRNAME must be on a
     filesystem accessible to the host.

          (gdb) target ctf ctf.ctf
          (gdb) tfind
          Found trace frame 0, tracepoint 2
          39            ++a;  /* set tracepoint 1 here */
          (gdb) tdump
          Data collected at tracepoint 2, trace frame 0:
          i = 0
          a = 0
          b = 1 '\001'
          c = {"123", "456", "789", "123", "456", "789"}
          d = {{{a = 1, b = 2}, {a = 3, b = 4}}, {{a = 5, b = 6}, {a = 7, b = 8}}}
          (gdb) p b
          $1 = 1

14 Debugging Programs That Use Overlays
***************************************

If your program is too large to fit completely in your target system's
memory, you can sometimes use "overlays" to work around this problem.
GDB provides some support for debugging programs that use overlays.

14.1 How Overlays Work
======================

Suppose you have a computer whose instruction address space is only 64
kilobytes long, but which has much more memory which can be accessed by
other means: special instructions, segment registers, or memory
management hardware, for example.  Suppose further that you want to
adapt a program which is larger than 64 kilobytes to run on this system.

   One solution is to identify modules of your program which are
relatively independent, and need not call each other directly; call
these modules "overlays".  Separate the overlays from the main program,
and place their machine code in the larger memory.  Place your main
program in instruction memory, but leave at least enough space there to
hold the largest overlay as well.

   Now, to call a function located in an overlay, you must first copy
that overlay's machine code from the large memory into the space set
aside for it in the instruction memory, and then jump to its entry point
there.

                         A code overlay

   The diagram (*note A code overlay::) shows a system with separate
data and instruction address spaces.  To map an overlay, the program
copies its code from the larger address space to the instruction address
space.  Since the overlays shown here all use the same mapped address,
only one may be mapped at a time.  For a system with a single address
space for data and instructions, the diagram would be similar, except
that the program variables and heap would share an address space with
the main program and the overlay area.

   An overlay loaded into instruction memory and ready for use is called
a "mapped" overlay; its "mapped address" is its address in the
instruction memory.  An overlay not present (or only partially present)
in instruction memory is called "unmapped"; its "load address" is its
address in the larger memory.  The mapped address is also called the
"virtual memory address", or "VMA"; the load address is also called the
"load memory address", or "LMA".

   Unfortunately, overlays are not a completely transparent way to adapt
a program to limited instruction memory.  They introduce a new set of
global constraints you must keep in mind as you design your program:

   * Before calling or returning to a function in an overlay, your
     program must make sure that overlay is actually mapped.  Otherwise,
     the call or return will transfer control to the right address, but
     in the wrong overlay, and your program will probably crash.

   * If the process of mapping an overlay is expensive on your system,
     you will need to choose your overlays carefully to minimize their
     effect on your program's performance.

   * The executable file you load onto your system must contain each
     overlay's instructions, appearing at the overlay's load address,
     not its mapped address.  However, each overlay's instructions must
     be relocated and its symbols defined as if the overlay were at its
     mapped address.  You can use GNU linker scripts to specify
     different load and relocation addresses for pieces of your program;
     see *note (ld.info)Overlay Description::.

   * The procedure for loading executable files onto your system must be
     able to load their contents into the larger address space as well
     as the instruction and data spaces.

   The overlay system described above is rather simple, and could be
improved in many ways:

   * If your system has suitable bank switch registers or memory
     management hardware, you could use those facilities to make an
     overlay's load area contents simply appear at their mapped address
     in instruction space.  This would probably be faster than copying
     the overlay to its mapped area in the usual way.

   * If your overlays are small enough, you could set aside more than
     one overlay area, and have more than one overlay mapped at a time.

   * You can use overlays to manage data, as well as instructions.  In
     general, data overlays are even less transparent to your design
     than code overlays: whereas code overlays only require care when
     you call or return to functions, data overlays require care every
     time you access the data.  Also, if you change the contents of a
     data overlay, you must copy its contents back out to its load
     address before you can copy a different data overlay into the same

14.2 Overlay Commands
=====================

To use GDB's overlay support, each overlay in your program must
correspond to a separate section of the executable file.  The section's
virtual memory address and load memory address must be the overlay's
mapped and load addresses.  Identifying overlays with sections allows
GDB to determine the appropriate address of a function or variable,
depending on whether the overlay is mapped or not.

   GDB's overlay commands all start with the word 'overlay'; you can
abbreviate this as 'ov' or 'ovly'.  The commands are:

'overlay off'
     Disable GDB's overlay support.  When overlay support is disabled,
     GDB assumes that all functions and variables are always present at
     their mapped addresses.  By default, GDB's overlay support is
     disabled.

'overlay manual'
     Enable "manual" overlay debugging.  In this mode, GDB relies on you
     to tell it which overlays are mapped, and which are not, using the
     'overlay map-overlay' and 'overlay unmap-overlay' commands
     described below.

'overlay map-overlay OVERLAY'
'overlay map OVERLAY'
     Tell GDB that OVERLAY is now mapped; OVERLAY must be the name of
     the object file section containing the overlay.  When an overlay is
     mapped, GDB assumes it can find the overlay's functions and
     variables at their mapped addresses.  GDB assumes that any other
     overlays whose mapped ranges overlap that of OVERLAY are now
     unmapped.

'overlay unmap-overlay OVERLAY'
'overlay unmap OVERLAY'
     Tell GDB that OVERLAY is no longer mapped; OVERLAY must be the name
     of the object file section containing the overlay.  When an overlay
     is unmapped, GDB assumes it can find the overlay's functions and
     variables at their load addresses.

'overlay auto'
     Enable "automatic" overlay debugging.  In this mode, GDB consults a
     data structure the overlay manager maintains in the inferior to see
     which overlays are mapped.  For details, see *note Automatic
     Overlay Debugging::.

'overlay load-target'
'overlay load'
     Re-read the overlay table from the inferior.  Normally, GDB
     re-reads the table GDB automatically each time the inferior stops,
     so this command should only be necessary if you have changed the
     overlay mapping yourself using GDB.  This command is only useful
     when using automatic overlay debugging.

'overlay list-overlays'
'overlay list'
     Display a list of the overlays currently mapped, along with their
     mapped addresses, load addresses, and sizes.

   Normally, when GDB prints a code address, it includes the name of the
function the address falls in:

     (gdb) print main
     $3 = {int ()} 0x11a0 <main>
When overlay debugging is enabled, GDB recognizes code in unmapped
overlays, and prints the names of unmapped functions with asterisks
around them.  For example, if 'foo' is a function in an unmapped
overlay, GDB prints it this way:

     (gdb) overlay list
     No sections are mapped.
     (gdb) print foo
     $5 = {int (int)} 0x100000 <*foo*>
When 'foo''s overlay is mapped, GDB prints the function's name normally:

     (gdb) overlay list
     Section .ov.foo.text, loaded at 0x100000 - 0x100034,
             mapped at 0x1016 - 0x104a
     (gdb) print foo
     $6 = {int (int)} 0x1016 <foo>

   When overlay debugging is enabled, GDB can find the correct address
for functions and variables in an overlay, whether or not the overlay is
mapped.  This allows most GDB commands, like 'break' and 'disassemble',
to work normally, even on unmapped code.  However, GDB's breakpoint
support has some limitations:

   * You can set breakpoints in functions in unmapped overlays, as long
     as GDB can write to the overlay at its load address.
   * GDB can not set hardware or simulator-based breakpoints in unmapped
     overlays.  However, if you set a breakpoint at the end of your
     overlay manager (and tell GDB which overlays are now mapped, if you
     are using manual overlay management), GDB will re-set its
     breakpoints properly.

14.3 Automatic Overlay Debugging
================================

GDB can automatically track which overlays are mapped and which are not,
given some simple co-operation from the overlay manager in the inferior.
If you enable automatic overlay debugging with the 'overlay auto'
command (*note Overlay Commands::), GDB looks in the inferior's memory
for certain variables describing the current state of the overlays.

   Here are the variables your overlay manager must define to support
GDB's automatic overlay debugging:

'_ovly_table':
     This variable must be an array of the following structures:

          struct
          {
            /* The overlay's mapped address.  */
            unsigned long vma;

            /* The size of the overlay, in bytes.  */
            unsigned long size;

            /* The overlay's load address.  */
            unsigned long lma;

            /* Non-zero if the overlay is currently mapped;
               zero otherwise.  */
            unsigned long mapped;
          }

'_novlys':
     This variable must be a four-byte signed integer, holding the total
     number of elements in '_ovly_table'.

   To decide whether a particular overlay is mapped or not, GDB looks
for an entry in '_ovly_table' whose 'vma' and 'lma' members equal the
VMA and LMA of the overlay's section in the executable file.  When GDB
finds a matching entry, it consults the entry's 'mapped' member to
determine whether the overlay is currently mapped.

   In addition, your overlay manager may define a function called
'_ovly_debug_event'.  If this function is defined, GDB will silently set
a breakpoint there.  If the overlay manager then calls this function
whenever it has changed the overlay table, this will enable GDB to
accurately keep track of which overlays are in program memory, and
update any breakpoints that may be set in overlays.  This will allow
breakpoints to work even if the overlays are kept in ROM or other
non-writable memory while they are not being executed.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Overlay Sample Program,  Prev: Automatic Overlay Debugging,  Up: Overlays

14.4 Overlay Sample Program
===========================

When linking a program which uses overlays, you must place the overlays
at their load addresses, while relocating them to run at their mapped
addresses.  To do this, you must write a linker script (*note
(ld.info)Overlay Description::).  Unfortunately, since linker scripts
are specific to a particular host system, target architecture, and
target memory layout, this manual cannot provide portable sample code
demonstrating GDB's overlay support.

   However, the GDB source distribution does contain an overlaid
program, with linker scripts for a few systems, as part of its test
suite.  The program consists of the following files from
'gdb/testsuite/gdb.base':

'overlays.c'
     The main program file.
'ovlymgr.c'
     A simple overlay manager, used by 'overlays.c'.
'foo.c'
'bar.c'
'baz.c'
'grbx.c'
     Overlay modules, loaded and used by 'overlays.c'.
'd10v.ld'
'm32r.ld'
     Linker scripts for linking the test program on the 'd10v-elf' and
     'm32r-elf' targets.

   You can build the test program using the 'd10v-elf' GCC
cross-compiler like this:

     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c overlays.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c ovlymgr.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c foo.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c bar.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c baz.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c grbx.c
     $ d10v-elf-gcc -g overlays.o ovlymgr.o foo.o bar.o \
                       baz.o grbx.o -Wl,-Td10v.ld -o overlays

   The build process is identical for any other architecture, except
that you must substitute the appropriate compiler and linker script for
the target system for 'd10v-elf-gcc' and 'd10v.ld'.

15 Using GDB with Different Languages
*************************************

Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are
rarely expressed in the same manner.  For instance, in ANSI C,
dereferencing a pointer 'p' is accomplished by '*p', but in Modula-2, it
is accomplished by 'p^'.  Values can also be represented (and displayed)
differently.  Hex numbers in C appear as '0x1ae', while in Modula-2 they
appear as '1AEH'.

   Language-specific information is built into GDB for some languages,
allowing you to express operations like the above in your program's
native language, and allowing GDB to output values in a manner
consistent with the syntax of your program's native language.  The
language you use to build expressions is called the "working language".

15.1 Switching Between Source Languages
=======================================

There are two ways to control the working language--either have GDB set
it automatically, or select it manually yourself.  You can use the 'set
language' command for either purpose.  On startup, GDB defaults to
setting the language automatically.  The working language is used to
determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values are
printed, etc.

   In addition to the working language, every source file that GDB knows
about has its own working language.  For some object file formats, the
compiler might indicate which language a particular source file is in.
However, most of the time GDB infers the language from the name of the
file.  The language of a source file controls whether C++ names are
demangled--this way 'backtrace' can show each frame appropriately for
its own language.  There is no way to set the language of a source file
from within GDB, but you can set the language associated with a filename
extension.  *Note Displaying the Language: Show.

   This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such as
'cfront' or 'f2c', that generates C but is written in another language.
In that case, make the program use '#line' directives in its C output;
that way GDB will know the correct language of the source code of the
original program, and will display that source code, not the generated C
code.

15.1.1 List of Filename Extensions and Languages
------------------------------------------------

If a source file name ends in one of the following extensions, then GDB
infers that its language is the one indicated.

'.ada'
'.ads'
'.adb'
'.a'
     Ada source file.

'.c'
     C source file

'.C'
'.cc'
'.cp'
'.cpp'
'.cxx'
'.c++'
     C++ source file

'.d'
     D source file

'.m'
     Objective-C source file

'.f'
'.F'
     Fortran source file

'.mod'
     Modula-2 source file

'.s'
'.S'
     Assembler source file.  This actually behaves almost like C, but
     GDB does not skip over function prologues when stepping.

   In addition, you may set the language associated with a filename
extension.  *Note Displaying the Language: Show.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Manually,  Next: Automatically,  Prev: Filenames,  Up: Setting

15.1.2 Setting the Working Language
-----------------------------------

If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, expressions are
interpreted the same way in your debugging session and your program.

   If you wish, you may set the language manually.  To do this, issue
the command 'set language LANG', where LANG is the name of a language,
such as 'c' or 'modula-2'.  For a list of the supported languages, type
'set language'.

   Setting the language manually prevents GDB from updating the working
language automatically.  This can lead to confusion if you try to debug
a program when the working language is not the same as the source
language, when an expression is acceptable to both languages--but means
different things.  For instance, if the current source file were written
in C, and GDB was parsing Modula-2, a command such as:

     print a = b + c

might not have the effect you intended.  In C, this means to add 'b' and
'c' and place the result in 'a'.  The result printed would be the value
of 'a'.  In Modula-2, this means to compare 'a' to the result of 'b+c',
yielding a 'BOOLEAN' value.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Automatically,  Prev: Manually,  Up: Setting

15.1.3 Having GDB Infer the Source Language
-------------------------------------------

To have GDB set the working language automatically, use 'set language
local' or 'set language auto'.  GDB then infers the working language.
That is, when your program stops in a frame (usually by encountering a
breakpoint), GDB sets the working language to the language recorded for
the function in that frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown
(that is, if the function or block corresponding to the frame was
defined in a source file that does not have a recognized extension), the
current working language is not changed, and GDB issues a warning.

   This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using 'set language auto' in this case
frees you from having to set the working language manually.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Show,  Next: Checks,  Prev: Setting,  Up: Languages

15.2 Displaying the Language
============================

The following commands help you find out which language is the working
language, and also what language source files were written in.

'show language'
     Display the current working language.  This is the language you can
     use with commands such as 'print' to build and compute expressions
     that may involve variables in your program.

'info frame'
     Display the source language for this frame.  This language becomes
     the working language if you use an identifier from this frame.
     *Note Information about a Frame: Frame Info, to identify the other
     information listed here.

'info source'
     Display the source language of this source file.  *Note Examining
     the Symbol Table: Symbols, to identify the other information listed
     here.

   In unusual circumstances, you may have source files with extensions
not in the standard list.  You can then set the extension associated
with a language explicitly:

'set extension-language EXT LANGUAGE'
     Tell GDB that source files with extension EXT are to be assumed as
     written in the source language LANGUAGE.

'info extensions'
     List all the filename extensions and the associated languages.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Checks,  Next: Supported Languages,  Prev: Show,  Up: Languages

15.3 Type and Range Checking
============================

Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common
errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks.  These include
checking the type of arguments to functions and operators and making
sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time.  Checks such as
these help to ensure a program's correctness once it has been compiled
by eliminating type mismatches and providing active checks for range
errors when your program is running.

   By default GDB checks for these errors according to the rules of the
current source language.  Although GDB does not check the statements in
your program, it can check expressions entered directly into GDB for
evaluation via the 'print' command, for example.

* Menu:

* Type Checking::               An overview of type checking
* Range Checking::              An overview of range checking


File: gdb.info,  Node: Type Checking,  Next: Range Checking,  Up: Checks

15.3.1 An Overview of Type Checking
-----------------------------------

Some languages, such as C and C++, are strongly typed, meaning that the
arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type,
otherwise an error occurs.  These checks prevent type mismatch errors
from ever causing any run-time problems.  For example,

     int klass::my_method(char *b) { return  b ? 1 : 2; }

     (gdb) print obj.my_method (0)
     $1 = 2
but
     (gdb) print obj.my_method (0x1234)
     Cannot resolve method klass::my_method to any overloaded instance

   The second example fails because in C++ the integer constant '0x1234'
is not type-compatible with the pointer parameter type.

   For the expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell GDB to not
enforce strict type checking or to treat any mismatches as errors and
abandon the expression; When type checking is disabled, GDB successfully
evaluates expressions like the second example above.

   Even if type checking is off, there may be other reasons related to
type that prevent GDB from evaluating an expression.  For instance, GDB
does not know how to add an 'int' and a 'struct foo'.  These particular
type errors have nothing to do with the language in use and usually
arise from expressions which make little sense to evaluate anyway.

   GDB provides some additional commands for controlling type checking:

'set check type on'
'set check type off'
     Set strict type checking on or off.  If any type mismatches occur
     in evaluating an expression while type checking is on, GDB prints a
     message and aborts evaluation of the expression.

'show check type'
     Show the current setting of type checking and whether GDB is
     enforcing strict type checking rules.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Range Checking,  Prev: Type Checking,  Up: Checks

15.3.2 An Overview of Range Checking
------------------------------------

In some languages (such as Modula-2), it is an error to exceed the
bounds of a type; this is enforced with run-time checks.  Such range
checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure
computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do
not exceed the bounds of the array.

   For expressions you use in GDB commands, you can tell GDB to treat
range errors in one of three ways: ignore them, always treat them as
errors and abandon the expression, or issue warnings but evaluate the
expression anyway.

   A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an
array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member of
any type.  Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an error.
In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the result to
"wrap around" to lower values--for example, if M is the largest integer
value, and S is the smallest, then

     M + 1 => S

   This, too, is specific to individual languages, and in some cases
specific to individual compilers or machines.  *Note Supported
Languages: Supported Languages, for further details on specific
languages.

   GDB provides some additional commands for controlling the range
checker:

'set check range auto'
     Set range checking on or off based on the current working language.
     *Note Supported Languages: Supported Languages, for the default
     settings for each language.

'set check range on'
'set check range off'
     Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for
     the current working language.  A warning is issued if the setting
     does not match the language default.  If a range error occurs and
     range checking is on, then a message is printed and evaluation of
     the expression is aborted.

'set check range warn'
     Output messages when the GDB range checker detects a range error,
     but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway.  Evaluating the
     expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as
     accessing memory that the process does not own (a typical example
     from many Unix systems).

'show range'
     Show the current setting of the range checker, and whether or not
     it is being set automatically by GDB.

GDB supports C, C++, D, Go, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, OpenCL C,
Pascal, assembly, Modula-2, and Ada.  Some GDB features may be used in
expressions regardless of the language you use: the GDB '@' and '::'
operators, and the '{type}addr' construct (*note Expressions:
Expressions.) can be used with the constructs of any supported language.

   The following sections detail to what degree each source language is
supported by GDB.  These sections are not meant to be language tutorials
or references, but serve only as a reference guide to what the GDB
expression parser accepts, and what input and output formats should look
like for different languages.  There are many good books written on each
of these languages; please look to these for a language reference or

Since C and C++ are so closely related, many features of GDB apply to
both languages.  Whenever this is the case, we discuss those languages
together.

   The C++ debugging facilities are jointly implemented by the C++
compiler and GDB.  Therefore, to debug your C++ code effectively, you
must compile your C++ programs with a supported C++ compiler, such as
GNU 'g++', or the HP ANSI C++ compiler ('aCC').

15.4.1.1 C and C++ Operators
............................

Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
'+' is defined on numbers, but not on structures.  Operators are often
defined on groups of types.

   For the purposes of C and C++, the following definitions hold:

   * _Integral types_ include 'int' with any of its storage-class
     specifiers; 'char'; 'enum'; and, for C++, 'bool'.

   * _Floating-point types_ include 'float', 'double', and 'long double'
     (if supported by the target platform).

   * _Pointer types_ include all types defined as '(TYPE *)'.

   * _Scalar types_ include all of the above.

The following operators are supported.  They are listed here in order of
increasing precedence:

','
     The comma or sequencing operator.  Expressions in a comma-separated
     list are evaluated from left to right, with the result of the
     entire expression being the last expression evaluated.

'='
     Assignment.  The value of an assignment expression is the value
     assigned.  Defined on scalar types.

'OP='
     Used in an expression of the form 'A OP= B', and translated to
     'A = A OP B'.  'OP=' and '=' have the same precedence.  The
     operator OP is any one of the operators '|', '^', '&', '<<', '>>',
     '+', '-', '*', '/', '%'.

'?:'
     The ternary operator.  'A ? B : C' can be thought of as: if A then
     B else C.  The argument A should be of an integral type.

'||'
     Logical OR.  Defined on integral types.

'&&'
     Logical AND.  Defined on integral types.

'|'
     Bitwise OR.  Defined on integral types.

'^'
     Bitwise exclusive-OR.  Defined on integral types.

'&'
     Bitwise AND.  Defined on integral types.

'==, !='
     Equality and inequality.  Defined on scalar types.  The value of
     these expressions is 0 for false and non-zero for true.

'<, >, <=, >='
     Less than, greater than, less than or equal, greater than or equal.
     Defined on scalar types.  The value of these expressions is 0 for
     false and non-zero for true.

'<<, >>'
     left shift, and right shift.  Defined on integral types.

'@'
     The GDB "artificial array" operator (*note Expressions:
     Expressions.).

'+, -'
     Addition and subtraction.  Defined on integral types,
     floating-point types and pointer types.

'*, /, %'
     Multiplication, division, and modulus.  Multiplication and division
     are defined on integral and floating-point types.  Modulus is
     defined on integral types.

'++, --'
     Increment and decrement.  When appearing before a variable, the
     operation is performed before the variable is used in an
     expression; when appearing after it, the variable's value is used
     before the operation takes place.

'*'
     Pointer dereferencing.  Defined on pointer types.  Same precedence
     as '++'.

'&'
     Address operator.  Defined on variables.  Same precedence as '++'.

     For debugging C++, GDB implements a use of '&' beyond what is
     allowed in the C++ language itself: you can use '&(&REF)' to
     examine the address where a C++ reference variable (declared with
     '&REF') is stored.

'-'
     Negative.  Defined on integral and floating-point types.  Same
     precedence as '++'.

'!'
     Logical negation.  Defined on integral types.  Same precedence as
     '++'.

'~'
     Bitwise complement operator.  Defined on integral types.  Same
     precedence as '++'.

'., ->'
     Structure member, and pointer-to-structure member.  For
     convenience, GDB regards the two as equivalent, choosing whether to
     dereference a pointer based on the stored type information.
     Defined on 'struct' and 'union' data.

'.*, ->*'
     Dereferences of pointers to members.

'[]'
     Array indexing.  'A[I]' is defined as '*(A+I)'.  Same precedence as
     '->'.

'()'
     Function parameter list.  Same precedence as '->'.

'::'
     C++ scope resolution operator.  Defined on 'struct', 'union', and
     'class' types.

'::'
     Doubled colons also represent the GDB scope operator (*note
     Expressions: Expressions.).  Same precedence as '::', above.

   If an operator is redefined in the user code, GDB usually attempts to
invoke the redefined version instead of using the operator's predefined
meaning.

15.4.1.2 C and C++ Constants
............................

GDB allows you to express the constants of C and C++ in the following
ways:

   * Integer constants are a sequence of digits.  Octal constants are
     specified by a leading '0' (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants
     by a leading '0x' or '0X'.  Constants may also end with a letter
     'l', specifying that the constant should be treated as a 'long'
     value.

   * Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a
     decimal point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally
     followed by an exponent.  An exponent is of the form:
     'e[[+]|-]NNN', where NNN is another sequence of digits.  The '+' is
     optional for positive exponents.  A floating-point constant may
     also end with a letter 'f' or 'F', specifying that the constant
     should be treated as being of the 'float' (as opposed to the
     default 'double') type; or with a letter 'l' or 'L', which
     specifies a 'long double' constant.

   * Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their
     integral equivalents.

   * Character constants are a single character surrounded by single
     quotes ('''), or a number--the ordinal value of the corresponding
     character (usually its ASCII value).  Within quotes, the single
     character may be represented by a letter or by "escape sequences",
     which are of the form '\NNN', where NNN is the octal representation
     of the character's ordinal value; or of the form '\X', where 'X' is
     a predefined special character--for example, '\n' for newline.

     Wide character constants can be written by prefixing a character
     constant with 'L', as in C. For example, 'L'x'' is the wide form of
     'x'.  The target wide character set is used when computing the
     value of this constant (*note Character Sets::).

   * String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded
     by double quotes ('"').  Any valid character constant (as described
     above) may appear.  Double quotes within the string must be
     preceded by a backslash, so for instance '"a\"b'c"' is a string of
     five characters.

     Wide string constants can be written by prefixing a string constant
     with 'L', as in C. The target wide character set is used when
     computing the value of this constant (*note Character Sets::).

   * Pointer constants are an integral value.  You can also write
     pointers to constants using the C operator '&'.

   * Array constants are comma-separated lists surrounded by braces '{'
     and '}'; for example, '{1,2,3}' is a three-element array of
     integers, '{{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}' is a three-by-two array, and
     '{&"hi", &"there", &"fred"}' is a three-element array of pointers.

15.4.1.3 C++ Expressions
........................

GDB expression handling can interpret most C++ expressions.

     _Warning:_ GDB can only debug C++ code if you use the proper
     compiler and the proper debug format.  Currently, GDB works best
     when debugging C++ code that is compiled with the most recent
     version of GCC possible.  The DWARF debugging format is preferred;
     GCC defaults to this on most popular platforms.  Other compilers
     and/or debug formats are likely to work badly or not at all when
     using GDB to debug C++ code.  *Note Compilation::.

  1. Member function calls are allowed; you can use expressions like

          count = aml->GetOriginal(x, y)

  2. While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame),
     your expressions have the same namespace available as the member
     function; that is, GDB allows implicit references to the class
     instance pointer 'this' following the same rules as C++.  'using'
     declarations in the current scope are also respected by GDB.

  3. You can call overloaded functions; GDB resolves the function call
     to the right definition, with some restrictions.  GDB does not
     perform overload resolution involving user-defined type
     conversions, calls to constructors, or instantiations of templates
     that do not exist in the program.  It also cannot handle ellipsis
     argument lists or default arguments.

     It does perform integral conversions and promotions, floating-point
     promotions, arithmetic conversions, pointer conversions,
     conversions of class objects to base classes, and standard
     conversions such as those of functions or arrays to pointers; it
     requires an exact match on the number of function arguments.

     Overload resolution is always performed, unless you have specified
     'set overload-resolution off'.  *Note GDB Features for C++:
     Debugging C Plus Plus.

     You must specify 'set overload-resolution off' in order to use an
     explicit function signature to call an overloaded function, as in
          p 'foo(char,int)'('x', 13)

     The GDB command-completion facility can simplify this; see *note
     Command Completion: Completion.

  4. GDB understands variables declared as C++ references; you can use
     them in expressions just as you do in C++ source--they are
     automatically dereferenced.

     In the parameter list shown when GDB displays a frame, the values
     of reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables);
     this avoids clutter, since references are often used for large
     structures.  The _address_ of a reference variable is always shown,
     unless you have specified 'set print address off'.

  5. GDB supports the C++ name resolution operator '::'--your
     expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do.
     Since one scope may be defined in another, you can use '::'
     repeatedly if necessary, for example in an expression like
     'SCOPE1::SCOPE2::NAME'.  GDB also allows resolving name scope by
     reference to source files, in both C and C++ debugging (*note
     Program Variables: Variables.).

  6. GDB performs argument-dependent lookup, following the C++
     specification.

15.4.1.4 C and C++ Defaults
...........................

If you allow GDB to set range checking automatically, it defaults to
'off' whenever the working language changes to C or C++.  This happens
regardless of whether you or GDB selects the working language.

   If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, it recognizes
source files whose names end with '.c', '.C', or '.cc', etc, and when
GDB enters code compiled from one of these files, it sets the working
language to C or C++.  *Note Having GDB Infer the Source Language:
Automatically, for further details.


File: gdb.info,  Node: C Checks,  Next: Debugging C,  Prev: C Defaults,  Up: C

15.4.1.5 C and C++ Type and Range Checks
........................................

By default, when GDB parses C or C++ expressions, strict type checking
is used.  However, if you turn type checking off, GDB will allow certain
non-standard conversions, such as promoting integer constants to
pointers.

   Range checking, if turned on, is done on mathematical operations.
Array indices are not checked, since they are often used to index a
pointer that is not itself an array.

15.4.1.6 GDB and C
..................

The 'set print union' and 'show print union' commands apply to the
'union' type.  When set to 'on', any 'union' that is inside a 'struct'
or 'class' is also printed.  Otherwise, it appears as '{...}'.

   The '@' operator aids in the debugging of dynamic arrays, formed with
pointers and a memory allocation function.  *Note Expressions:

15.4.1.7 GDB Features for C++
.............................

Some GDB commands are particularly useful with C++, and some are
designed specifically for use with C++.  Here is a summary:

'breakpoint menus'
     When you want a breakpoint in a function whose name is overloaded,
     GDB has the capability to display a menu of possible breakpoint
     locations to help you specify which function definition you want.
     *Note Ambiguous Expressions: Ambiguous Expressions.

'rbreak REGEX'
     Setting breakpoints using regular expressions is helpful for
     setting breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of
     any special classes.  *Note Setting Breakpoints: Set Breaks.

'catch throw'
'catch rethrow'
'catch catch'
     Debug C++ exception handling using these commands.  *Note Setting
     Catchpoints: Set Catchpoints.

'ptype TYPENAME'
     Print inheritance relationships as well as other information for
     type TYPENAME.  *Note Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols.

'info vtbl EXPRESSION.'
     The 'info vtbl' command can be used to display the virtual method
     tables of the object computed by EXPRESSION.  This shows one entry
     per virtual table; there may be multiple virtual tables when
     multiple inheritance is in use.

'set print demangle'
'show print demangle'
'set print asm-demangle'
'show print asm-demangle'
     Control whether C++ symbols display in their source form, both when
     displaying code as C++ source and when displaying disassemblies.
     *Note Print Settings: Print Settings.

'set print object'
'show print object'
     Choose whether to print derived (actual) or declared types of
     objects.  *Note Print Settings: Print Settings.

'set print vtbl'
'show print vtbl'
     Control the format for printing virtual function tables.  *Note
     Print Settings: Print Settings.  (The 'vtbl' commands do not work
     on programs compiled with the HP ANSI C++ compiler ('aCC').)

'set overload-resolution on'
     Enable overload resolution for C++ expression evaluation.  The
     default is on.  For overloaded functions, GDB evaluates the
     arguments and searches for a function whose signature matches the
     argument types, using the standard C++ conversion rules (see *note
     C++ Expressions: C Plus Plus Expressions, for details).  If it
     cannot find a match, it emits a message.

'set overload-resolution off'
     Disable overload resolution for C++ expression evaluation.  For
     overloaded functions that are not class member functions, GDB
     chooses the first function of the specified name that it finds in
     the symbol table, whether or not its arguments are of the correct
     type.  For overloaded functions that are class member functions,
     GDB searches for a function whose signature _exactly_ matches the
     argument types.

'show overload-resolution'
     Show the current setting of overload resolution.

'Overloaded symbol names'
     You can specify a particular definition of an overloaded symbol,
     using the same notation that is used to declare such symbols in
     C++: type 'SYMBOL(TYPES)' rather than just SYMBOL.  You can also
     use the GDB command-line word completion facilities to list the
     available choices, or to finish the type list for you.  *Note
     Command Completion: Completion, for details on how to do this.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Decimal Floating Point,  Prev: Debugging C Plus Plus,  Up: C

15.4.1.8 Decimal Floating Point format
......................................

GDB can examine, set and perform computations with numbers in decimal
floating point format, which in the C language correspond to the
'_Decimal32', '_Decimal64' and '_Decimal128' types as specified by the
extension to support decimal floating-point arithmetic.

   There are two encodings in use, depending on the architecture: BID
(Binary Integer Decimal) for x86 and x86-64, and DPD (Densely Packed
Decimal) for PowerPC and S/390.  GDB will use the appropriate encoding
for the configured target.

   Because of a limitation in 'libdecnumber', the library used by GDB to
manipulate decimal floating point numbers, it is not possible to convert
(using a cast, for example) integers wider than 32-bit to decimal float.

   In addition, in order to imitate GDB's behaviour with binary floating
point computations, error checking in decimal float operations ignores
underflow, overflow and divide by zero exceptions.

   In the PowerPC architecture, GDB provides a set of pseudo-registers
to inspect '_Decimal128' values stored in floating point registers.  See
*note PowerPC: PowerPC. for more details.

15.4.2 D
--------

GDB can be used to debug programs written in D and compiled with GDC,
LDC or DMD compilers.  Currently GDB supports only one D specific
feature -- dynamic arrays.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Go,  Next: Objective-C,  Prev: D,  Up: Supported Languages

15.4.3 Go
---------

GDB can be used to debug programs written in Go and compiled with
'gccgo' or '6g' compilers.

   Here is a summary of the Go-specific features and restrictions:

'The current Go package'
     The name of the current package does not need to be specified when
     specifying global variables and functions.

     For example, given the program:

          package main
          var myglob = "Shall we?"
          func main () {
            // ...
          }

     When stopped inside 'main' either of these work:

          (gdb) p myglob
          (gdb) p main.myglob

'Builtin Go types'
     The 'string' type is recognized by GDB and is printed as a string.

'Builtin Go functions'
     The GDB expression parser recognizes the 'unsafe.Sizeof' function
     and handles it internally.

'Restrictions on Go expressions'
     All Go operators are supported except '&^'.  The Go '_' "blank
     identifier" is not supported.  Automatic dereferencing of pointers
     is not supported.

15.4.4 Objective-C
------------------

This section provides information about some commands and command
options that are useful for debugging Objective-C code.  See also *note
info classes: Symbols, and *note info selectors: Symbols, for a few more
commands specific to Objective-C support.

* Menu:

* Method Names in Commands::
* The Print Command with Objective-C::


File: gdb.info,  Node: Method Names in Commands,  Next: The Print Command with Objective-C,  Up: Objective-C

15.4.4.1 Method Names in Commands
.................................

The following commands have been extended to accept Objective-C method
names as line specifications:

   * 'clear'
   * 'break'
   * 'info line'
   * 'jump'
   * 'list'

   A fully qualified Objective-C method name is specified as

     -[CLASS METHODNAME]

   where the minus sign is used to indicate an instance method and a
plus sign (not shown) is used to indicate a class method.  The class
name CLASS and method name METHODNAME are enclosed in brackets, similar
to the way messages are specified in Objective-C source code.  For
example, to set a breakpoint at the 'create' instance method of class
'Fruit' in the program currently being debugged, enter:

     break -[Fruit create]

   To list ten program lines around the 'initialize' class method,
enter:

     list +[NSText initialize]

   In the current version of GDB, the plus or minus sign is required.
In future versions of GDB, the plus or minus sign will be optional, but
you can use it to narrow the search.  It is also possible to specify
just a method name:

     break create

   You must specify the complete method name, including any colons.  If
your program's source files contain more than one 'create' method,
you'll be presented with a numbered list of classes that implement that
method.  Indicate your choice by number, or type '0' to exit if none
apply.

   As another example, to clear a breakpoint established at the
'makeKeyAndOrderFront:' method of the 'NSWindow' class, enter:

     clear -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFront:]

15.4.4.2 The Print Command With Objective-C
...........................................

The print command has also been extended to accept methods.  For
example:

     print -[OBJECT hash]

will tell GDB to send the 'hash' message to OBJECT and print the result.
Also, an additional command has been added, 'print-object' or 'po' for
short, which is meant to print the description of an object.  However,
this command may only work with certain Objective-C libraries that have
a particular hook function, '_NSPrintForDebugger', defined.

--------------

GDB can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, but it currently
supports only the features of Fortran 77 language.

   Some Fortran compilers (GNU Fortran 77 and Fortran 95 compilers among
them) append an underscore to the names of variables and functions.
When you debug programs compiled by those compilers, you will need to
refer to variables and functions with a trailing underscore.

15.4.6.1 Fortran Operators and Expressions
..........................................

Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
'+' is defined on numbers, but not on characters or other non-
arithmetic types.  Operators are often defined on groups of types.

'**'
     The exponentiation operator.  It raises the first operand to the
     power of the second one.

':'
     The range operator.  Normally used in the form of array(low:high)
     to represent a section of array.

'%'
     The access component operator.  Normally used to access elements in
     derived types.  Also suitable for unions.  As unions aren't part of
     regular Fortran, this can only happen when accessing a register
     that uses a gdbarch-defined union type.

15.4.6.2 Fortran Defaults

Fortran symbols are usually case-insensitive, so GDB by default uses
case-insensitive matches for Fortran symbols.  You can change that with
the 'set case-insensitive' command, see *note Symbols::, for the
details.

15.4.6.3 Special Fortran Commands
.................................

GDB has some commands to support Fortran-specific features, such as
displaying common blocks.

'info common [COMMON-NAME]'
     This command prints the values contained in the Fortran 'COMMON'
     block whose name is COMMON-NAME.  With no argument, the names of
     all 'COMMON' blocks visible at the current program location are
     printed.

---------------

The extensions made to GDB to support Modula-2 only support output from
the GNU Modula-2 compiler (which is currently being developed).  Other
Modula-2 compilers are not currently supported, and attempting to debug
executables produced by them is most likely to give an error as GDB
reads in the executable's symbol table.

15.4.8.1 Operators
..................

Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
'+' is defined on numbers, but not on structures.  Operators are often
defined on groups of types.  For the purposes of Modula-2, the following
definitions hold:

   * _Integral types_ consist of 'INTEGER', 'CARDINAL', and their
     subranges.

   * _Character types_ consist of 'CHAR' and its subranges.

   * _Floating-point types_ consist of 'REAL'.

   * _Pointer types_ consist of anything declared as 'POINTER TO TYPE'.

   * _Scalar types_ consist of all of the above.

   * _Set types_ consist of 'SET' and 'BITSET' types.

   * _Boolean types_ consist of 'BOOLEAN'.

The following operators are supported, and appear in order of increasing
precedence:

','
     Function argument or array index separator.

':='
     Assignment.  The value of VAR ':=' VALUE is VALUE.

'<, >'
     Less than, greater than on integral, floating-point, or enumerated
     types.

'<=, >='
     Less than or equal to, greater than or equal to on integral,
     floating-point and enumerated types, or set inclusion on set types.
     Same precedence as '<'.

'=, <>, #'
     Equality and two ways of expressing inequality, valid on scalar
     types.  Same precedence as '<'.  In GDB scripts, only '<>' is
     available for inequality, since '#' conflicts with the script
     comment character.

'IN'
     Set membership.  Defined on set types and the types of their
     members.  Same precedence as '<'.

'OR'
     Boolean disjunction.  Defined on boolean types.

'AND, &'
     Boolean conjunction.  Defined on boolean types.

'@'
     The GDB "artificial array" operator (*note Expressions:
     Expressions.).

'+, -'
     Addition and subtraction on integral and floating-point types, or
     union and difference on set types.

'*'
     Multiplication on integral and floating-point types, or set
     intersection on set types.

'/'
     Division on floating-point types, or symmetric set difference on
     set types.  Same precedence as '*'.

'DIV, MOD'
     Integer division and remainder.  Defined on integral types.  Same
     precedence as '*'.

'-'
     Negative.  Defined on 'INTEGER' and 'REAL' data.

'^'
     Pointer dereferencing.  Defined on pointer types.

'NOT'
     Boolean negation.  Defined on boolean types.  Same precedence as
     '^'.

'.'
     'RECORD' field selector.  Defined on 'RECORD' data.  Same
     precedence as '^'.

'[]'
     Array indexing.  Defined on 'ARRAY' data.  Same precedence as '^'.

'()'
     Procedure argument list.  Defined on 'PROCEDURE' objects.  Same
     precedence as '^'.

'::, .'
     GDB and Modula-2 scope operators.

     _Warning:_ Set expressions and their operations are not yet
     supported, so GDB treats the use of the operator 'IN', or the use
     of operators '+', '-', '*', '/', '=', , '<>', '#', '<=', and '>='
     on sets as an error.

15.4.8.2 Built-in Functions and Procedures
..........................................

Modula-2 also makes available several built-in procedures and functions.
In describing these, the following metavariables are used:

A
     represents an 'ARRAY' variable.

C
     represents a 'CHAR' constant or variable.

I
     represents a variable or constant of integral type.

M
     represents an identifier that belongs to a set.  Generally used in
     the same function with the metavariable S.  The type of S should be
     'SET OF MTYPE' (where MTYPE is the type of M).

N
     represents a variable or constant of integral or floating-point
     type.

R
     represents a variable or constant of floating-point type.

T
     represents a type.

V
     represents a variable.

X
     represents a variable or constant of one of many types.  See the
     explanation of the function for details.

   All Modula-2 built-in procedures also return a result, described
below.

'ABS(N)'
     Returns the absolute value of N.

'CAP(C)'
     If C is a lower case letter, it returns its upper case equivalent,
     otherwise it returns its argument.

'CHR(I)'
     Returns the character whose ordinal value is I.

'DEC(V)'
     Decrements the value in the variable V by one.  Returns the new
     value.

'DEC(V,I)'
     Decrements the value in the variable V by I.  Returns the new
     value.

'EXCL(M,S)'
     Removes the element M from the set S.  Returns the new set.

'FLOAT(I)'
     Returns the floating point equivalent of the integer I.

'HIGH(A)'

     value.

'INC(V,I)'
     Increments the value in the variable V by I.  Returns the new
     value.

'INCL(M,S)'
     Adds the element M to the set S if it is not already there.
     Returns the new set.

'MAX(T)'
     Returns the maximum value of the type T.

'MIN(T)'
     Returns the minimum value of the type T.

'ODD(I)'
     Returns boolean TRUE if I is an odd number.

'ORD(X)'
     Returns the ordinal value of its argument.  For example, the
     ordinal value of a character is its ASCII value (on machines
     supporting the ASCII character set).  The argument X must be of an
     ordered type, which include integral, character and enumerated
     types.

'SIZE(X)'
     Returns the size of its argument.  The argument X can be a variable
     or a type.

'TRUNC(R)'
     Returns the integral part of R.

'TSIZE(X)'
     Returns the size of its argument.  The argument X can be a variable
     or a type.

'VAL(T,I)'
     Returns the member of the type T whose ordinal value is I.

     _Warning:_ Sets and their operations are not yet supported, so GDB
     treats the use of procedures 'INCL' and 'EXCL' as an error.

15.4.8.3 Constants
..................

GDB allows you to express the constants of Modula-2 in the following
ways:

   * Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits.  When used in an
     expression, a constant is interpreted to be type-compatible with
     the rest of the expression.  Hexadecimal integers are specified by
     a trailing 'H', and octal integers by a trailing 'B'.

   * Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed
     by a decimal point and another sequence of digits.  An optional
     exponent can then be specified, in the form 'E[+|-]NNN', where
     '[+|-]NNN' is the desired exponent.  All of the digits of the
     floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10) digits.

   * Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a
     pair of like quotes, either single (''') or double ('"').  They may
     also be expressed by their ordinal value (their ASCII value,
     usually) followed by a 'C'.

   * String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a
     pair of like quotes, either single (''') or double ('"').  Escape
     sequences in the style of C are also allowed.  *Note C and C++
     Constants: C Constants, for a brief explanation of escape
     sequences.

   * Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.

   * Boolean constants consist of the identifiers 'TRUE' and 'FALSE'.

   * Pointer constants consist of integral values only.

   * Set constants are not yet supported.

15.4.8.4 Modula-2 Types
.......................

Currently GDB can print the following data types in Modula-2 syntax:
array types, record types, set types, pointer types, procedure types,
enumerated types, subrange types and base types.  You can also print the
contents of variables declared using these type.  This section gives a
number of simple source code examples together with sample GDB sessions.

   The first example contains the following section of code:

     VAR
        s: SET OF CHAR ;
        r: [20..40] ;

and you can request GDB to interrogate the type and value of 'r' and
's'.

     (gdb) print s
     {'A'..'C', 'Z'}
     (gdb) ptype s
     SET OF CHAR
     (gdb) print r
     21
     (gdb) ptype r
     [20..40]

Likewise if your source code declares 's' as:

     VAR
        s: SET ['A'..'Z'] ;

then you may query the type of 's' by:

     (gdb) ptype s
     type = SET ['A'..'Z']

Note that at present you cannot interactively manipulate set expressions
using the debugger.

   The following example shows how you might declare an array in
Modula-2 and how you can interact with GDB to print its type and
contents:

     VAR
        s: ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR ;

     (gdb) ptype s
     ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR

   Note that the array handling is not yet complete and although the
type is printed correctly, expression handling still assumes that all
arrays have a lower bound of zero and not '-10' as in the example above.

   Here are some more type related Modula-2 examples:

     TYPE
        colour = (blue, red, yellow, green) ;
        t = [blue..yellow] ;
     VAR
        s: t ;
     BEGIN
        s := blue ;

The GDB interaction shows how you can query the data type and value of a
variable.

     (gdb) print s
     $1 = blue
     (gdb) ptype t
     type = [blue..yellow]

In this example a Modula-2 array is declared and its contents displayed.
Observe that the contents are written in the same way as their 'C'
counterparts.

     VAR
        s: ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
     BEGIN
        s[1] := 1 ;

     (gdb) print s
     $1 = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
     (gdb) ptype s
     type = ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL

   The Modula-2 language interface to GDB also understands pointer types
as shown in this example:

     VAR
        s: POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
     BEGIN
        NEW(s) ;
        s^[1] := 1 ;

and you can request that GDB describes the type of 's'.

     (gdb) ptype s
     type = POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL

   GDB handles compound types as we can see in this example.  Here we
combine array types, record types, pointer types and subrange types:

     TYPE
        foo = RECORD
                 f1: CARDINAL ;
                 f2: CHAR ;
                 f3: myarray ;
              END ;

        myarray = ARRAY myrange OF CARDINAL ;
        myrange = [-2..2] ;
     VAR
        s: POINTER TO ARRAY myrange OF foo ;

and you can ask GDB to describe the type of 's' as shown below.

     (gdb) ptype s
     type = POINTER TO ARRAY [-2..2] OF foo = RECORD
         f1 : CARDINAL;
         f2 : CHAR;
         f3 : ARRAY [-2..2] OF CARDINAL;
     END

15.4.8.5 Modula-2 Defaults
..........................

If type and range checking are set automatically by GDB, they both
default to 'on' whenever the working language changes to Modula-2.  This
happens regardless of whether you or GDB selected the working language.

   If you allow GDB to set the language automatically, then entering
code compiled from a file whose name ends with '.mod' sets the working
language to Modula-2.  *Note Having GDB Infer the Source Language:
Automatically, for further details.

15.4.8.6 Deviations from Standard Modula-2
..........................................

A few changes have been made to make Modula-2 programs easier to debug.
This is done primarily via loosening its type strictness:

   * Unlike in standard Modula-2, pointer constants can be formed by
     integers.  This allows you to modify pointer variables during
     debugging.  (In standard Modula-2, the actual address contained in
     a pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified
     through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression
     that returned a pointer.)

   * C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to
     represent non-printable characters.  GDB prints out strings with
     these escape sequences embedded.  Single non-printable characters
     are printed using the 'CHR(NNN)' format.

   * The assignment operator (':=') returns the value of its right-hand
     argument.

   * All built-in procedures both modify _and_ return their argument.

15.4.8.7 Modula-2 Type and Range Checks
.......................................

     _Warning:_ in this release, GDB does not yet perform type or range
     checking.

   GDB considers two Modula-2 variables type equivalent if:

   * They are of types that have been declared equivalent via a 'TYPE T1
     = T2' statement

   * They have been declared on the same line.  (Note: This is true of
     the GNU Modula-2 compiler, but it may not be true of other
     compilers.)

   As long as type checking is enabled, any attempt to combine variables
whose types are not equivalent is an error.

   Range checking is done on all mathematical operations, assignment,
array index bounds, and all built-in functions and procedures.


File: gdb.info,  Node: M2 Scope,  Next: GDB/M2,  Prev: M2 Checks,  Up: Modula-2

15.4.8.8 The Scope Operators '::' and '.'
.........................................

There are a few subtle differences between the Modula-2 scope operator
('.') and the GDB scope operator ('::').  The two have similar syntax:


     MODULE . ID
     SCOPE :: ID

where SCOPE is the name of a module or a procedure, MODULE the name of a
module, and ID is any declared identifier within your program, except
another module.

   Using the '::' operator makes GDB search the scope specified by SCOPE
for the identifier ID.  If it is not found in the specified scope, then
GDB searches all scopes enclosing the one specified by SCOPE.

   Using the '.' operator makes GDB search the current scope for the
identifier specified by ID that was imported from the definition module
specified by MODULE.  With this operator, it is an error if the
identifier ID was not imported from definition module MODULE, or if ID
is not an identifier in MODULE.

15.4.8.9 GDB and Modula-2
.........................

Some GDB commands have little use when debugging Modula-2 programs.
Five subcommands of 'set print' and 'show print' apply specifically to C
and C++: 'vtbl', 'demangle', 'asm-demangle', 'object', and 'union'.  The
first four apply to C++, and the last to the C 'union' type, which has
no direct analogue in Modula-2.

   The '@' operator (*note Expressions: Expressions.), while available
with any language, is not useful with Modula-2.  Its intent is to aid
the debugging of "dynamic arrays", which cannot be created in Modula-2
as they can in C or C++.  However, because an address can be specified
by an integral constant, the construct '{TYPE}ADREXP' is still useful.

   In GDB scripts, the Modula-2 inequality operator '#' is interpreted
as the beginning of a comment.  Use '<>' instead.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Ada Mode Intro,  Next: Omissions from Ada,  Up: Ada

15.4.9.1 Introduction
.....................

The Ada mode of GDB supports a fairly large subset of Ada expression
syntax, with some extensions.  The philosophy behind the design of this
subset is

   * That GDB should provide basic literals and access to operations for
     arithmetic, dereferencing, field selection, indexing, and
     subprogram calls, leaving more sophisticated computations to
     subprograms written into the program (which therefore may be called
     from GDB).

   * That type safety and strict adherence to Ada language restrictions
     are not particularly important to the GDB user.

   * That brevity is important to the GDB user.

   Thus, for brevity, the debugger acts as if all names declared in
user-written packages are directly visible, even if they are not visible
according to Ada rules, thus making it unnecessary to fully qualify most
names with their packages, regardless of context.  Where this causes
ambiguity, GDB asks the user's intent.

   The debugger will start in Ada mode if it detects an Ada main
program.  As for other languages, it will enter Ada mode when stopped in
a program that was translated from an Ada source file.

   While in Ada mode, you may use '--' for comments.  This is useful
mostly for documenting command files.  The standard GDB comment ('#')
still works at the beginning of a line in Ada mode, but not in the
middle (to allow based literals).

   The debugger supports limited overloading.  Given a subprogram call
in which the function symbol has multiple definitions, it will use the
number of actual parameters and some information about their types to
attempt to narrow the set of definitions.  It also makes very limited
use of context, preferring procedures to functions in the context of the
'call' command, and functions to procedures elsewhere.

15.4.9.2 Omissions from Ada
...........................

Here are the notable omissions from the subset:

   * Only a subset of the attributes are supported:

        - 'First, 'Last, and 'Length on array objects (not on types and
          subtypes).

        - 'Min and 'Max.

        - 'Pos and 'Val.

        - 'Tag.

        - 'Range on array objects (not subtypes), but only as the right
          operand of the membership ('in') operator.

        - 'Access, 'Unchecked_Access, and 'Unrestricted_Access (a GNAT
          extension).

        - 'Address.

   * The names in 'Characters.Latin_1' are not available and
     concatenation is not implemented.  Thus, escape characters in
     strings are not currently available.

   * Equality tests ('=' and '/=') on arrays test for bitwise equality
     of representations.  They will generally work correctly for strings
     and arrays whose elements have integer or enumeration types.  They
     may not work correctly for arrays whose element types have
     user-defined equality, for arrays of real values (in particular,
     IEEE-conformant floating point, because of negative zeroes and
     NaNs), and for arrays whose elements contain unused bits with
     indeterminate values.

   * The other component-by-component array operations ('and', 'or',
     'xor', 'not', and relational tests other than equality) are not
     implemented.

   * There is limited support for array and record aggregates.  They are
     permitted only on the right sides of assignments, as in these
     examples:

          (gdb) set An_Array := (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
          (gdb) set An_Array := (1, others => 0)
          (gdb) set An_Array := (0|4 => 1, 1..3 => 2, 5 => 6)
          (gdb) set A_2D_Array := ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))
          (gdb) set A_Record := (1, "Peter", True);
          (gdb) set A_Record := (Name => "Peter", Id => 1, Alive => True)

     Changing a discriminant's value by assigning an aggregate has an
     undefined effect if that discriminant is used within the record.
     However, you can first modify discriminants by directly assigning
     to them (which normally would not be allowed in Ada), and then
     performing an aggregate assignment.  For example, given a variable
     'A_Rec' declared to have a type such as:

          type Rec (Len : Small_Integer := 0) is record
              Id : Integer;
              Vals : IntArray (1 .. Len);
          end record;

     you can assign a value with a different size of 'Vals' with two
     assignments:

          (gdb) set A_Rec.Len := 4
          (gdb) set A_Rec := (Id => 42, Vals => (1, 2, 3, 4))

     As this example also illustrates, GDB is very loose about the usual
     rules concerning aggregates.  You may leave out some of the
     components of an array or record aggregate (such as the 'Len'
     component in the assignment to 'A_Rec' above); they will retain
     their original values upon assignment.  You may freely use dynamic
     values as indices in component associations.  You may even use
     overlapping or redundant component associations, although which
     component values are assigned in such cases is not defined.

   * Calls to dispatching subprograms are not implemented.

   * The overloading algorithm is much more limited (i.e., less
     selective) than that of real Ada.  It makes only limited use of the
     context in which a subexpression appears to resolve its meaning,
     and it is much looser in its rules for allowing type matches.  As a
     result, some function calls will be ambiguous, and the user will be
     asked to choose the proper resolution.

   * The 'new' operator is not implemented.

   * Entry calls are not implemented.

   * Aside from printing, arithmetic operations on the native VAX
     floating-point formats are not supported.

   * It is not possible to slice a packed array.

   * The names 'True' and 'False', when not part of a qualified name,
     are interpreted as if implicitly prefixed by 'Standard', regardless
     of context.  Should your program redefine these names in a package
     or procedure (at best a dubious practice), you will have to use
     fully qualified names to access their new definitions.

15.4.9.3 Additions to Ada
.........................

As it does for other languages, GDB makes certain generic extensions to
Ada (*note Expressions::):

   * If the expression E is a variable residing in memory (typically a
     local variable or array element) and N is a positive integer, then
     'E@N' displays the values of E and the N-1 adjacent variables
     following it in memory as an array.  In Ada, this operator is
     generally not necessary, since its prime use is in displaying parts
     of an array, and slicing will usually do this in Ada.  However,
     there are occasional uses when debugging programs in which certain
     debugging information has been optimized away.

   * 'B::VAR' means "the variable named VAR that appears in function or
     file B."  When B is a file name, you must typically surround it in
     single quotes.

   * The expression '{TYPE} ADDR' means "the variable of type TYPE that
     appears at address ADDR."

   * A name starting with '$' is a convenience variable (*note
     Convenience Vars::) or a machine register (*note Registers::).

   In addition, GDB provides a few other shortcuts and outright
additions specific to Ada:

   * The assignment statement is allowed as an expression, returning its
     right-hand operand as its value.  Thus, you may enter

          (gdb) set x := y + 3
          (gdb) print A(tmp := y + 1)

   * The semicolon is allowed as an "operator," returning as its value
     the value of its right-hand operand.  This allows, for example,
     complex conditional breaks:

          (gdb) break f
          (gdb) condition 1 (report(i); k += 1; A(k) > 100)

   * Rather than use catenation and symbolic character names to
     introduce special characters into strings, one may instead use a
     special bracket notation, which is also used to print strings.  A
     sequence of characters of the form '["XX"]' within a string or
     character literal denotes the (single) character whose numeric
     encoding is XX in hexadecimal.  The sequence of characters '["""]'
     also denotes a single quotation mark in strings.  For example,
             "One line.["0a"]Next line.["0a"]"
     contains an ASCII newline character ('Ada.Characters.Latin_1.LF')
     after each period.

   * The subtype used as a prefix for the attributes 'Pos, 'Min, and
     'Max is optional (and is ignored in any case).  For example, it is
     valid to write

          (gdb) print 'max(x, y)

   * When printing arrays, GDB uses positional notation when the array
     has a lower bound of 1, and uses a modified named notation
     otherwise.  For example, a one-dimensional array of three integers
     with a lower bound of 3 might print as

          (3 => 10, 17, 1)

     That is, in contrast to valid Ada, only the first component has a
     '=>' clause.

   * You may abbreviate attributes in expressions with any unique,
     multi-character subsequence of their names (an exact match gets
     preference).  For example, you may use a'len, a'gth, or a'lh in
     place of a'length.

   * Since Ada is case-insensitive, the debugger normally maps
     identifiers you type to lower case.  The GNAT compiler uses
     upper-case characters for some of its internal identifiers, which
     are normally of no interest to users.  For the rare occasions when
     you actually have to look at them, enclose them in angle brackets
     to avoid the lower-case mapping.  For example,
          (gdb) print <JMPBUF_SAVE>[0]

   * Printing an object of class-wide type or dereferencing an
     access-to-class-wide value will display all the components of the
     object's specific type (as indicated by its run-time tag).
     Likewise, component selection on such a value will operate on the
     specific type of the object.

15.4.9.4 Stopping at the Very Beginning
.......................................

It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration, and
before reaching the main procedure.  As defined in the Ada Reference
Manual, the elaboration code is invoked from a procedure called
'adainit'.  To run your program up to the beginning of elaboration,
simply use the following two commands: 'tbreak adainit' and 'run'.

15.4.9.5 Ada Exceptions
.......................

A command is provided to list all Ada exceptions:

'info exceptions'
'info exceptions REGEXP'
     The 'info exceptions' command allows you to list all Ada exceptions
     defined within the program being debugged, as well as their
     addresses.  With a regular expression, REGEXP, as argument, only
     those exceptions whose names match REGEXP are listed.

   Below is a small example, showing how the command can be used, first
without argument, and next with a regular expression passed as an
argument.

     (gdb) info exceptions
     All defined Ada exceptions:
     constraint_error: 0x613da0
     program_error: 0x613d20
     storage_error: 0x613ce0
     tasking_error: 0x613ca0
     const.aint_global_e: 0x613b00
     (gdb) info exceptions const.aint
     All Ada exceptions matching regular expression "const.aint":
     constraint_error: 0x613da0
     const.aint_global_e: 0x613b00

   It is also possible to ask GDB to stop your program's execution when

15.4.9.6 Extensions for Ada Tasks
.................................

Support for Ada tasks is analogous to that for threads (*note
Threads::).  GDB provides the following task-related commands:

'info tasks'
     This command shows a list of current Ada tasks, as in the following
     example:

          (gdb) info tasks
            ID       TID P-ID Pri State                 Name
             1   8088000   0   15 Child Activation Wait main_task
             2   80a4000   1   15 Accept Statement      b
             3   809a800   1   15 Child Activation Wait a
          *  4   80ae800   3   15 Runnable              c


     In this listing, the asterisk before the last task indicates it to
     be the task currently being inspected.

     ID
          Represents GDB's internal task number.

     TID
          The Ada task ID.

     P-ID
          The parent's task ID (GDB's internal task number).

     Pri
          The base priority of the task.

     State
          Current state of the task.

          'Unactivated'
               The task has been created but has not been activated.  It
               cannot be executing.

          'Runnable'
               The task is not blocked for any reason known to Ada.  (It
               may be waiting for a mutex, though.)  It is conceptually
               "executing" in normal mode.

          'Terminated'
               The task is terminated, in the sense of ARM 9.3 (5).  Any
               dependents that were waiting on terminate alternatives
               have been awakened and have terminated themselves.

          'Child Activation Wait'
               The task is waiting for created tasks to complete
               activation.

          'Accept Statement'
               The task is waiting on an accept or selective wait
               statement.

          'Waiting on entry call'
               The task is waiting on an entry call.

          'Async Select Wait'
               The task is waiting to start the abortable part of an
               asynchronous select statement.

          'Delay Sleep'
               The task is waiting on a select statement with only a
               delay alternative open.

          'Child Termination Wait'
               The task is sleeping having completed a master within
               itself, and is waiting for the tasks dependent on that
               master to become terminated or waiting on a terminate
               Phase.

          'Wait Child in Term Alt'
               The task is sleeping waiting for tasks on terminate
               alternatives to finish terminating.

          'Accepting RV with TASKNO'
               The task is accepting a rendez-vous with the task TASKNO.

     Name
          Name of the task in the program.

'info task TASKNO'
     This command shows detailled informations on the specified task, as
     in the following example:
          (gdb) info tasks
            ID       TID P-ID Pri State                  Name
             1   8077880    0  15 Child Activation Wait  main_task
          *  2   807c468    1  15 Runnable               task_1
          (gdb) info task 2
          Ada Task: 0x807c468
          Name: task_1
          Thread: 0x807f378
          Parent: 1 (main_task)
          Base Priority: 15
          State: Runnable

'task'
     This command prints the ID of the current task.

          (gdb) info tasks
            ID       TID P-ID Pri State                  Name
             1   8077870    0  15 Child Activation Wait  main_task
          *  2   807c458    1  15 Runnable               t
          (gdb) task
          [Current task is 2]

'task TASKNO'
     This command is like the 'thread THREADNO' command (*note
     Threads::).  It switches the context of debugging from the current
     task to the given task.

          (gdb) info tasks
            ID       TID P-ID Pri State                  Name
             1   8077870    0  15 Child Activation Wait  main_task
          *  2   807c458    1  15 Runnable               t
          (gdb) task 1
          [Switching to task 1]
          #0  0x8067726 in pthread_cond_wait ()
          (gdb) bt
          #0  0x8067726 in pthread_cond_wait ()
          #1  0x8056714 in system.os_interface.pthread_cond_wait ()
          #2  0x805cb63 in system.task_primitives.operations.sleep ()
          #3  0x806153e in system.tasking.stages.activate_tasks ()
          #4  0x804aacc in un () at un.adb:5

'break LINESPEC task TASKNO'
'break LINESPEC task TASKNO if ...'
     These commands are like the 'break ... thread ...' command (*note
     Thread Stops::).  The LINESPEC argument specifies source lines, as
     described in *note Specify Location::.

     Use the qualifier 'task TASKNO' with a breakpoint command to
     specify that you only want GDB to stop the program when a
     particular Ada task reaches this breakpoint.  The TASKNO is one of
     the numeric task identifiers assigned by GDB, shown in the first
     column of the 'info tasks' display.

     If you do not specify 'task TASKNO' when you set a breakpoint, the
     breakpoint applies to _all_ tasks of your program.

     You can use the 'task' qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
     well; in this case, place 'task TASKNO' before the breakpoint
     condition (before the 'if').

     For example,

          (gdb) info tasks
            ID       TID P-ID Pri State                 Name
             1 140022020   0   15 Child Activation Wait main_task
             2 140045060   1   15 Accept/Select Wait    t2
             3 140044840   1   15 Runnable              t1
          *  4 140056040   1   15 Runnable              t3
          (gdb) b 15 task 2
          Breakpoint 5 at 0x120044cb0: file test_task_debug.adb, line 15.
          (gdb) cont
          Continuing.
          task # 1 running
          task # 2 running

          Breakpoint 5, test_task_debug () at test_task_debug.adb:15
          15               flush;
          (gdb) info tasks
            ID       TID P-ID Pri State                 Name
             1 140022020   0   15 Child Activation Wait main_task
          *  2 140045060   1   15 Runnable              t2
             3 140044840   1   15 Runnable              t1
             4 140056040   1   15 Delay Sleep           t3

15.4.9.7 Tasking Support when Debugging Core Files
..................................................

When inspecting a core file, as opposed to debugging a live program,
tasking support may be limited or even unavailable, depending on the
platform being used.  For instance, on x86-linux, the list of tasks is
available, but task switching is not supported.  On Tru64, however, task
switching will work as usual.

   On certain platforms, including Tru64, the debugger needs to perform
some memory writes in order to provide Ada tasking support.  When
inspecting a core file, this means that the core file must be opened
with read-write privileges, using the command '"set write on"' (*note
Patching::).  Under these circumstances, you should make a backup copy
of the core file before inspecting it with GDB.

15.4.9.8 Tasking Support when using the Ravenscar Profile
.........................................................

The "Ravenscar Profile" is a subset of the Ada tasking features,
specifically designed for systems with safety-critical real-time
requirements.

'set ravenscar task-switching on'
     Allows task switching when debugging a program that uses the
     Ravenscar Profile.  This is the default.

'set ravenscar task-switching off'
     Turn off task switching when debugging a program that uses the
     Ravenscar Profile.  This is mostly intended to disable the code
     that adds support for the Ravenscar Profile, in case a bug in
     either GDB or in the Ravenscar runtime is preventing GDB from
     working properly.  To be effective, this command should be run
     before the program is started.

'show ravenscar task-switching'
     Show whether it is possible to switch from task to task in a
     program using the Ravenscar Profile.

15.4.9.9 Known Peculiarities of Ada Mode
........................................

Besides the omissions listed previously (*note Omissions from Ada::), we
know of several problems with and limitations of Ada mode in GDB, some
of which will be fixed with planned future releases of the debugger and
the GNU Ada compiler.

   * Static constants that the compiler chooses not to materialize as
     objects in storage are invisible to the debugger.

   * Named parameter associations in function argument lists are ignored
     (the argument lists are treated as positional).

   * Many useful library packages are currently invisible to the
     debugger.

   * Fixed-point arithmetic, conversions, input, and output is carried
     out using floating-point arithmetic, and may give results that only
     approximate those on the host machine.

   * The GNAT compiler never generates the prefix 'Standard' for any of
     the standard symbols defined by the Ada language.  GDB knows about
     this: it will strip the prefix from names when you use it, and will
     never look for a name you have so qualified among local symbols,
     nor match against symbols in other packages or subprograms.  If you
     have defined entities anywhere in your program other than
     parameters and local variables whose simple names match names in
     'Standard', GNAT's lack of qualification here can cause confusion.
     When this happens, you can usually resolve the confusion by
     qualifying the problematic names with package 'Standard'
     explicitly.

   Older versions of the compiler sometimes generate erroneous debugging
information, resulting in the debugger incorrectly printing the value of
affected entities.  In some cases, the debugger is able to work around
an issue automatically.  In other cases, the debugger is able to work
around the issue, but the work-around has to be specifically enabled.

'set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS on'
     Configure GDB to strictly follow the GNAT encoding when computing
     the value of Ada entities, particularly when 'PAD' and 'PAD___XVS'
     types are involved (see 'ada/exp_dbug.ads' in the GCC sources for a
     complete description of the encoding used by the GNAT compiler).
     This is the default.

'set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS off'
     This is related to the encoding using by the GNAT compiler.  If GDB
     sometimes prints the wrong value for certain entities, changing
     'ada trust-PAD-over-XVS' to 'off' activates a work-around which may
     fix the issue.  It is always safe to set 'ada trust-PAD-over-XVS'
     to 'off', but this incurs a slight performance penalty, so it is
     recommended to leave this setting to 'on' unless necessary.

   Internally, the debugger also relies on the compiler following a
number of conventions known as the 'GNAT Encoding', all documented in
'gcc/ada/exp_dbug.ads' in the GCC sources.  This encoding describes how
the debugging information should be generated for certain types.  In
particular, this convention makes use of "descriptive types", which are
artificial types generated purely to help the debugger.

   These encodings were defined at a time when the debugging information
format used was not powerful enough to describe some of the more complex
types available in Ada.  Since DWARF allows us to express nearly all Ada
features, the long-term goal is to slowly replace these descriptive
types by their pure DWARF equivalent.  To facilitate that transition, a
new maintenance option is available to force the debugger to ignore
those descriptive types.  It allows the user to quickly evaluate how
well GDB works without them.

'maintenance ada set ignore-descriptive-types [on|off]'
     Control whether the debugger should ignore descriptive types.  The
     default is not to ignore descriptives types ('off').

'maintenance ada show ignore-descriptive-types'
     Show if descriptive types are ignored by GDB.

15.5 Unsupported Languages
==========================

In addition to the other fully-supported programming languages, GDB also
provides a pseudo-language, called 'minimal'.  It does not represent a
real programming language, but provides a set of capabilities close to
what the C or assembly languages provide.  This should allow most simple
operations to be performed while debugging an application that uses a
language currently not supported by GDB.

   If the language is set to 'auto', GDB will automatically select this
language if the current frame corresponds to an unsupported language.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Symbols,  Next: Altering,  Prev: Languages,  Up: Top

16 Examining the Symbol Table
*****************************

The commands described in this chapter allow you to inquire about the
symbols (names of variables, functions and types) defined in your
program.  This information is inherent in the text of your program and
does not change as your program executes.  GDB finds it in your
program's symbol table, in the file indicated when you started GDB
(*note Choosing Files: File Options.), or by one of the file-management
commands (*note Commands to Specify Files: Files.).

   Occasionally, you may need to refer to symbols that contain unusual
characters, which GDB ordinarily treats as word delimiters.  The most
frequent case is in referring to static variables in other source files
(*note Program Variables: Variables.).  File names are recorded in
object files as debugging symbols, but GDB would ordinarily parse a
typical file name, like 'foo.c', as the three words 'foo' '.'  'c'.  To
allow GDB to recognize 'foo.c' as a single symbol, enclose it in single
quotes; for example,

     p 'foo.c'::x

looks up the value of 'x' in the scope of the file 'foo.c'.

'set case-sensitive on'
'set case-sensitive off'
'set case-sensitive auto'
     Normally, when GDB looks up symbols, it matches their names with
     case sensitivity determined by the current source language.
     Occasionally, you may wish to control that.  The command 'set
     case-sensitive' lets you do that by specifying 'on' for
     case-sensitive matches or 'off' for case-insensitive ones.  If you
     specify 'auto', case sensitivity is reset to the default suitable
     for the source language.  The default is case-sensitive matches for
     all languages except for Fortran, for which the default is
     case-insensitive matches.

'show case-sensitive'
     This command shows the current setting of case sensitivity for
     symbols lookups.

'set print type methods'
'set print type methods on'
'set print type methods off'
     Normally, when GDB prints a class, it displays any methods declared
     in that class.  You can control this behavior either by passing the
     appropriate flag to 'ptype', or using 'set print type methods'.
     Specifying 'on' will cause GDB to display the methods; this is the
     default.  Specifying 'off' will cause GDB to omit the methods.

'show print type methods'
     This command shows the current setting of method display when
     printing classes.

'set print type typedefs'
'set print type typedefs on'
'set print type typedefs off'

     Normally, when GDB prints a class, it displays any typedefs defined
     in that class.  You can control this behavior either by passing the
     appropriate flag to 'ptype', or using 'set print type typedefs'.
     Specifying 'on' will cause GDB to display the typedef definitions;
     this is the default.  Specifying 'off' will cause GDB to omit the
     typedef definitions.  Note that this controls whether the typedef
     definition itself is printed, not whether typedef names are
     substituted when printing other types.

'show print type typedefs'
     This command shows the current setting of typedef display when
     printing classes.

'info address SYMBOL'
     Describe where the data for SYMBOL is stored.  For a register
     variable, this says which register it is kept in.  For a
     non-register local variable, this prints the stack-frame offset at
     which the variable is always stored.

     Note the contrast with 'print &SYMBOL', which does not work at all
     for a register variable, and for a stack local variable prints the
     exact address of the current instantiation of the variable.

'info symbol ADDR'
     Print the name of a symbol which is stored at the address ADDR.  If
     no symbol is stored exactly at ADDR, GDB prints the nearest symbol
     and an offset from it:

          (gdb) info symbol 0x54320
          _initialize_vx + 396 in section .text

     This is the opposite of the 'info address' command.  You can use it
     to find out the name of a variable or a function given its address.

     For dynamically linked executables, the name of executable or
     shared library containing the symbol is also printed:

          (gdb) info symbol 0x400225
          _start + 5 in section .text of /tmp/a.out
          (gdb) info symbol 0x2aaaac2811cf
          __read_nocancel + 6 in section .text of /usr/lib64/libc.so.6

'whatis[/FLAGS] [ARG]'
     Print the data type of ARG, which can be either an expression or a
     name of a data type.  With no argument, print the data type of '$',
     the last value in the value history.

     If ARG is an expression (*note Expressions: Expressions.), it is
     not actually evaluated, and any side-effecting operations (such as
     assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place.

     If ARG is a variable or an expression, 'whatis' prints its literal
     type as it is used in the source code.  If the type was defined
     using a 'typedef', 'whatis' will _not_ print the data type
     underlying the 'typedef'.  If the type of the variable or the
     expression is a compound data type, such as 'struct' or 'class',
     'whatis' never prints their fields or methods.  It just prints the
     'struct'/'class' name (a.k.a. its "tag").  If you want to see the
     members of such a compound data type, use 'ptype'.

     If ARG is a type name that was defined using 'typedef', 'whatis'
     "unrolls" only one level of that 'typedef'.  Unrolling means that
     'whatis' will show the underlying type used in the 'typedef'
     declaration of ARG.  However, if that underlying type is also a
     'typedef', 'whatis' will not unroll it.

     For C code, the type names may also have the form 'class
     CLASS-NAME', 'struct STRUCT-TAG', 'union UNION-TAG' or 'enum
     ENUM-TAG'.

     FLAGS can be used to modify how the type is displayed.  Available
     flags are:

     'r'
          Display in "raw" form.  Normally, GDB substitutes template
          parameters and typedefs defined in a class when printing the
          class' members.  The '/r' flag disables this.

     'm'
          Do not print methods defined in the class.

     'M'
          Print methods defined in the class.  This is the default, but
          the flag exists in case you change the default with 'set print
          type methods'.

     't'
          Do not print typedefs defined in the class.  Note that this
          controls whether the typedef definition itself is printed, not
          whether typedef names are substituted when printing other
          types.

     'T'
          Print typedefs defined in the class.  This is the default, but
          the flag exists in case you change the default with 'set print
          type typedefs'.

'ptype[/FLAGS] [ARG]'
     'ptype' accepts the same arguments as 'whatis', but prints a
     detailed description of the type, instead of just the name of the
     type.  *Note Expressions: Expressions.

     Contrary to 'whatis', 'ptype' always unrolls any 'typedef's in its
     argument declaration, whether the argument is a variable,
     expression, or a data type.  This means that 'ptype' of a variable
     or an expression will not print literally its type as present in
     the source code--use 'whatis' for that.  'typedef's at the pointer
     or reference targets are also unrolled.  Only 'typedef's of fields,
     methods and inner 'class typedef's of 'struct's, 'class'es and
     'union's are not unrolled even with 'ptype'.

     For example, for this variable declaration:

          typedef double real_t;
          struct complex { real_t real; double imag; };
          typedef struct complex complex_t;
          complex_t var;
          real_t *real_pointer_var;

     the two commands give this output:

          (gdb) whatis var
          type = complex_t
          (gdb) ptype var
          type = struct complex {
              real_t real;
              double imag;
          }
          (gdb) whatis complex_t
          type = struct complex
          (gdb) whatis struct complex
          type = struct complex
          (gdb) ptype struct complex
          type = struct complex {
              real_t real;
              double imag;
          }
          (gdb) whatis real_pointer_var
          type = real_t *
          (gdb) ptype real_pointer_var
          type = double *

     As with 'whatis', using 'ptype' without an argument refers to the
     type of '$', the last value in the value history.

     Sometimes, programs use opaque data types or incomplete
     specifications of complex data structure.  If the debug information
     included in the program does not allow GDB to display a full
     declaration of the data type, it will say '<incomplete type>'.  For
     example, given these declarations:

              struct foo;
              struct foo *fooptr;

     but no definition for 'struct foo' itself, GDB will say:

            (gdb) ptype foo
            $1 = <incomplete type>

     "Incomplete type" is C terminology for data types that are not
     completely specified.

'info types REGEXP'
'info types'
     Print a brief description of all types whose names match the
     regular expression REGEXP (or all types in your program, if you
     supply no argument).  Each complete typename is matched as though
     it were a complete line; thus, 'i type value' gives information on
     all types in your program whose names include the string 'value',
     but 'i type ^value$' gives information only on types whose complete
     name is 'value'.

     This command differs from 'ptype' in two ways: first, like
     'whatis', it does not print a detailed description; second, it
     lists all source files where a type is defined.

'info type-printers'
     Versions of GDB that ship with Python scripting enabled may have
     "type printers" available.  When using 'ptype' or 'whatis', these
     printers are consulted when the name of a type is needed.  *Note
     Type Printing API::, for more information on writing type printers.

     'info type-printers' displays all the available type printers.

'enable type-printer NAME...'
'disable type-printer NAME...'
     These commands can be used to enable or disable type printers.

'info scope LOCATION'
     List all the variables local to a particular scope.  This command
     accepts a LOCATION argument--a function name, a source line, or an
     address preceded by a '*', and prints all the variables local to
     the scope defined by that location.  (*Note Specify Location::, for
     details about supported forms of LOCATION.)  For example:

          (gdb) info scope command_line_handler
          Scope for command_line_handler:
          Symbol rl is an argument at stack/frame offset 8, length 4.
          Symbol linebuffer is in static storage at address 0x150a18, length 4.
          Symbol linelength is in static storage at address 0x150a1c, length 4.
          Symbol p is a local variable in register $esi, length 4.
          Symbol p1 is a local variable in register $ebx, length 4.
          Symbol nline is a local variable in register $edx, length 4.
          Symbol repeat is a local variable at frame offset -8, length 4.

     This command is especially useful for determining what data to
     collect during a "trace experiment", see *note collect: Tracepoint
     Actions.

'info source'
     Show information about the current source file--that is, the source
     file for the function containing the current point of execution:
        * the name of the source file, and the directory containing it,
        * the directory it was compiled in,
        * its length, in lines,
        * which programming language it is written in,
        * whether the executable includes debugging information for that
          file, and if so, what format the information is in (e.g.,
          STABS, Dwarf 2, etc.), and
        * whether the debugging information includes information about
          preprocessor macros.

'info sources'
     Print the names of all source files in your program for which there
     is debugging information, organized into two lists: files whose
     symbols have already been read, and files whose symbols will be
     read when needed.

'info functions'
     Print the names and data types of all defined functions.

'info functions REGEXP'
     Print the names and data types of all defined functions whose names
     contain a match for regular expression REGEXP.  Thus, 'info fun
     step' finds all functions whose names include 'step'; 'info fun
     ^step' finds those whose names start with 'step'.  If a function
     name contains characters that conflict with the regular expression
     language (e.g. 'operator*()'), they may be quoted with a backslash.

'info variables'
     Print the names and data types of all variables that are defined
     outside of functions (i.e. excluding local variables).

'info variables REGEXP'
     Print the names and data types of all variables (except for local
     variables) whose names contain a match for regular expression
     REGEXP.

'info classes'
'info classes REGEXP'
     Display all Objective-C classes in your program, or (with the
     REGEXP argument) all those matching a particular regular
     expression.

'info selectors'
'info selectors REGEXP'
     Display all Objective-C selectors in your program, or (with the
     REGEXP argument) all those matching a particular regular
     expression.

'set opaque-type-resolution on'
     Tell GDB to resolve opaque types.  An opaque type is a type
     declared as a pointer to a 'struct', 'class', or 'union'--for
     example, 'struct MyType *'--that is used in one source file
     although the full declaration of 'struct MyType' is in another
     source file.  The default is on.

     A change in the setting of this subcommand will not take effect
     until the next time symbols for a file are loaded.

'set opaque-type-resolution off'
     Tell GDB not to resolve opaque types.  In this case, the type is
     printed as follows:
          {<no data fields>}

'show opaque-type-resolution'
     Show whether opaque types are resolved or not.

'set print symbol-loading'
'set print symbol-loading full'
'set print symbol-loading brief'
'set print symbol-loading off'
     The 'set print symbol-loading' command allows you to control the
     printing of messages when GDB loads symbol information.  By default
     a message is printed for the executable and one for each shared
     library, and normally this is what you want.  However, when
     debugging apps with large numbers of shared libraries these
     messages can be annoying.  When set to 'brief' a message is printed
     for each executable, and when GDB loads a collection of shared
     libraries at once it will only print one message regardless of the
     number of shared libraries.  When set to 'off' no messages are
     printed.

'show print symbol-loading'
     Show whether messages will be printed when a GDB command entered
     from the keyboard causes symbol information to be loaded.

'maint print symbols FILENAME'
'maint print psymbols FILENAME'
'maint print msymbols FILENAME'
     Write a dump of debugging symbol data into the file FILENAME.
     These commands are used to debug the GDB symbol-reading code.  Only
     symbols with debugging data are included.  If you use 'maint print
     symbols', GDB includes all the symbols for which it has already
     collected full details: that is, FILENAME reflects symbols for only
     those files whose symbols GDB has read.  You can use the command
     'info sources' to find out which files these are.  If you use
     'maint print psymbols' instead, the dump shows information about
     symbols that GDB only knows partially--that is, symbols defined in
     files that GDB has skimmed, but not yet read completely.  Finally,
     'maint print msymbols' dumps just the minimal symbol information
     required for each object file from which GDB has read some symbols.
     *Note Commands to Specify Files: Files, for a discussion of how GDB
     reads symbols (in the description of 'symbol-file').

'maint info symtabs [ REGEXP ]'
'maint info psymtabs [ REGEXP ]'

     List the 'struct symtab' or 'struct partial_symtab' structures
     whose names match REGEXP.  If REGEXP is not given, list them all.
     The output includes expressions which you can copy into a GDB
     debugging this one to examine a particular structure in more
     detail.  For example:

          (gdb) maint info psymtabs dwarf2read
          { objfile /home/gnu/build/gdb/gdb
            ((struct objfile *) 0x82e69d0)
            { psymtab /home/gnu/src/gdb/dwarf2read.c
              ((struct partial_symtab *) 0x8474b10)
              readin no
              fullname (null)
              text addresses 0x814d3c8 -- 0x8158074
              globals (* (struct partial_symbol **) 0x8507a08 @ 9)
              statics (* (struct partial_symbol **) 0x40e95b78 @ 2882)
              dependencies (none)
            }
          }
          (gdb) maint info symtabs
          (gdb)
     We see that there is one partial symbol table whose filename
     contains the string 'dwarf2read', belonging to the 'gdb'
     executable; and we see that GDB has not read in any symtabs yet at
     all.  If we set a breakpoint on a function, that will cause GDB to
     read the symtab for the compilation unit containing that function:

          (gdb) break dwarf2_psymtab_to_symtab
          Breakpoint 1 at 0x814e5da: file /home/gnu/src/gdb/dwarf2read.c,
          line 1574.
          (gdb) maint info symtabs
          { objfile /home/gnu/build/gdb/gdb
            ((struct objfile *) 0x82e69d0)
            { symtab /home/gnu/src/gdb/dwarf2read.c
              ((struct symtab *) 0x86c1f38)
              dirname (null)
              fullname (null)

17 Altering Execution
*********************

Once you think you have found an error in your program, you might want
to find out for certain whether correcting the apparent error would lead
to correct results in the rest of the run.  You can find the answer by
experiment, using the GDB features for altering execution of the
program.

   For example, you can store new values into variables or memory
locations, give your program a signal, restart it at a different
address, or even return prematurely from a function.

* Menu:

* Assignment::                  Assignment to variables
* Jumping::                     Continuing at a different address

File: gdb.info,  Node: Assignment,  Next: Jumping,  Up: Altering

17.1 Assignment to Variables
============================

To alter the value of a variable, evaluate an assignment expression.
*Note Expressions: Expressions.  For example,

     print x=4

stores the value 4 into the variable 'x', and then prints the value of
the assignment expression (which is 4).  *Note Using GDB with Different
Languages: Languages, for more information on operators in supported
languages.

   If you are not interested in seeing the value of the assignment, use
the 'set' command instead of the 'print' command.  'set' is really the
same as 'print' except that the expression's value is not printed and is
not put in the value history (*note Value History: Value History.).  The
expression is evaluated only for its effects.

   If the beginning of the argument string of the 'set' command appears
identical to a 'set' subcommand, use the 'set variable' command instead
of just 'set'.  This command is identical to 'set' except for its lack
of subcommands.  For example, if your program has a variable 'width',
you get an error if you try to set a new value with just 'set width=13',
because GDB has the command 'set width':

     (gdb) whatis width
     type = double
     (gdb) p width
     $4 = 13
     (gdb) set width=47
     Invalid syntax in expression.

The invalid expression, of course, is '=47'.  In order to actually set
the program's variable 'width', use

     (gdb) set var width=47

   Because the 'set' command has many subcommands that can conflict with
the names of program variables, it is a good idea to use the 'set
variable' command instead of just 'set'.  For example, if your program
has a variable 'g', you run into problems if you try to set a new value
with just 'set g=4', because GDB has the command 'set gnutarget',
abbreviated 'set g':

     (gdb) whatis g
     type = double
     (gdb) p g
     $1 = 1
     (gdb) set g=4
     (gdb) p g
     $2 = 1
     (gdb) r
     The program being debugged has been started already.
     Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
     Starting program: /home/smith/cc_progs/a.out
     "/home/smith/cc_progs/a.out": can't open to read symbols:
                                      Invalid bfd target.
     (gdb) show g
     The current BFD target is "=4".

The program variable 'g' did not change, and you silently set the
'gnutarget' to an invalid value.  In order to set the variable 'g', use

     (gdb) set var g=4

   GDB allows more implicit conversions in assignments than C; you can
freely store an integer value into a pointer variable or vice versa, and
you can convert any structure to any other structure that is the same
length or shorter.

   To store values into arbitrary places in memory, use the '{...}'
construct to generate a value of specified type at a specified address
(*note Expressions: Expressions.).  For example, '{int}0x83040' refers
to memory location '0x83040' as an integer (which implies a certain size
and representation in memory), and

     set {int}0x83040 = 4

stores the value 4 into that memory location.

17.2 Continuing at a Different Address
======================================

Ordinarily, when you continue your program, you do so at the place where
it stopped, with the 'continue' command.  You can instead continue at an
address of your own choosing, with the following commands:

'jump LINESPEC'
'j LINESPEC'
'jump LOCATION'
'j LOCATION'
     Resume execution at line LINESPEC or at address given by LOCATION.
     Execution stops again immediately if there is a breakpoint there.
     *Note Specify Location::, for a description of the different forms
     of LINESPEC and LOCATION.  It is common practice to use the
     'tbreak' command in conjunction with 'jump'.  *Note Setting
     Breakpoints: Set Breaks.

     The 'jump' command does not change the current stack frame, or the
     stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
     register other than the program counter.  If line LINESPEC is in a
     different function from the one currently executing, the results
     may be bizarre if the two functions expect different patterns of
     arguments or of local variables.  For this reason, the 'jump'
     command requests confirmation if the specified line is not in the
     function currently executing.  However, even bizarre results are
     predictable if you are well acquainted with the machine-language
     code of your program.

   On many systems, you can get much the same effect as the 'jump'
command by storing a new value into the register '$pc'.  The difference
is that this does not start your program running; it only changes the
address of where it _will_ run when you continue.  For example,

     set $pc = 0x485

makes the next 'continue' command or stepping command execute at address
'0x485', rather than at the address where your program stopped.  *Note
Continuing and Stepping: Continuing and Stepping.

   The most common occasion to use the 'jump' command is to back
up--perhaps with more breakpoints set--over a portion of a program that
has already executed, in order to examine its execution in more detail.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Signaling,  Next: Returning,  Prev: Jumping,  Up: Altering

17.3 Giving your Program a Signal
=================================

'signal SIGNAL'
     Resume execution where your program stopped, but immediately give
     it the signal SIGNAL.  The SIGNAL can be the name or the number of
     a signal.  For example, on many systems 'signal 2' and 'signal
     SIGINT' are both ways of sending an interrupt signal.

     Alternatively, if SIGNAL is zero, continue execution without giving
     a signal.  This is useful when your program stopped on account of a
     signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the
     'continue' command; 'signal 0' causes it to resume without a
     signal.

     'signal' does not repeat when you press <RET> a second time after
     executing the command.

   Invoking the 'signal' command is not the same as invoking the 'kill'
utility from the shell.  Sending a signal with 'kill' causes GDB to
decide what to do with the signal depending on the signal handling
tables (*note Signals::).  The 'signal' command passes the signal
directly to your program.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Returning,  Next: Calling,  Prev: Signaling,  Up: Altering

17.4 Returning from a Function
==============================

'return'
'return EXPRESSION'
     You can cancel execution of a function call with the 'return'
     command.  If you give an EXPRESSION argument, its value is used as
     the function's return value.

   When you use 'return', GDB discards the selected stack frame (and all
frames within it).  You can think of this as making the discarded frame
return prematurely.  If you wish to specify a value to be returned, give
that value as the argument to 'return'.

   This pops the selected stack frame (*note Selecting a Frame:
Selection.), and any other frames inside of it, leaving its caller as
the innermost remaining frame.  That frame becomes selected.  The
specified value is stored in the registers used for returning values of
functions.

   The 'return' command does not resume execution; it leaves the program
stopped in the state that would exist if the function had just returned.
In contrast, the 'finish' command (*note Continuing and Stepping:
Continuing and Stepping.) resumes execution until the selected stack
frame returns naturally.

   GDB needs to know how the EXPRESSION argument should be set for the
inferior.  The concrete registers assignment depends on the OS ABI and
the type being returned by the selected stack frame.  For example it is
common for OS ABI to return floating point values in FPU registers while
integer values in CPU registers.  Still some ABIs return even floating
point values in CPU registers.  Larger integer widths (such as 'long
long int') also have specific placement rules.  GDB already knows the OS
ABI from its current target so it needs to find out also the type being
returned to make the assignment into the right register(s).

   Normally, the selected stack frame has debug info.  GDB will always
use the debug info instead of the implicit type of EXPRESSION when the
debug info is available.  For example, if you type 'return -1', and the
function in the current stack frame is declared to return a 'long long
int', GDB transparently converts the implicit 'int' value of -1 into a
'long long int':

     Breakpoint 1, func () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:29
     29        return 31;
     (gdb) return -1
     Make func return now? (y or n) y
     #0  0x004004f6 in main () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:43
     43        printf ("result=%lld\n", func ());
     (gdb)

   However, if the selected stack frame does not have a debug info,
e.g., if the function was compiled without debug info, GDB has to find
out the type to return from user.  Specifying a different type by
mistake may set the value in different inferior registers than the
caller code expects.  For example, typing 'return -1' with its implicit
type 'int' would set only a part of a 'long long int' result for a debug
info less function (on 32-bit architectures).  Therefore the user is
required to specify the return type by an appropriate cast explicitly:

     Breakpoint 2, 0x0040050b in func ()
     (gdb) return -1
     Return value type not available for selected stack frame.
     Please use an explicit cast of the value to return.
     (gdb) return (long long int) -1
     Make selected stack frame return now? (y or n) y
     #0  0x00400526 in main ()
     (gdb)

17.5 Calling Program Functions
==============================

'print EXPR'
     Evaluate the expression EXPR and display the resulting value.  The
     expression may include calls to functions in the program being
     debugged.

'call EXPR'
     Evaluate the expression EXPR without displaying 'void' returned
     values.

     You can use this variant of the 'print' command if you want to
     execute a function from your program that does not return anything
     (a.k.a. "a void function"), but without cluttering the output with
     'void' returned values that GDB will otherwise print.  If the
     result is not void, it is printed and saved in the value history.

   It is possible for the function you call via the 'print' or 'call'
command to generate a signal (e.g., if there's a bug in the function, or
if you passed it incorrect arguments).  What happens in that case is
controlled by the 'set unwindonsignal' command.

   Similarly, with a C++ program it is possible for the function you
call via the 'print' or 'call' command to generate an exception that is
not handled due to the constraints of the dummy frame.  In this case,
any exception that is raised in the frame, but has an out-of-frame
exception handler will not be found.  GDB builds a dummy-frame for the
inferior function call, and the unwinder cannot seek for exception
handlers outside of this dummy-frame.  What happens in that case is
controlled by the 'set unwind-on-terminating-exception' command.

'set unwindonsignal'
     Set unwinding of the stack if a signal is received while in a
     function that GDB called in the program being debugged.  If set to
     on, GDB unwinds the stack it created for the call and restores the
     context to what it was before the call.  If set to off (the
     default), GDB stops in the frame where the signal was received.

'show unwindonsignal'
     Show the current setting of stack unwinding in the functions called
     by GDB.

'set unwind-on-terminating-exception'
     Set unwinding of the stack if a C++ exception is raised, but left
     unhandled while in a function that GDB called in the program being
     debugged.  If set to on (the default), GDB unwinds the stack it
     created for the call and restores the context to what it was before
     the call.  If set to off, GDB the exception is delivered to the
     default C++ exception handler and the inferior terminated.

'show unwind-on-terminating-exception'
     Show the current setting of stack unwinding in the functions called
     by GDB.

   Sometimes, a function you wish to call is actually a "weak alias" for
another function.  In such case, GDB might not pick up the type
information, including the types of the function arguments, which causes
GDB to call the inferior function incorrectly.  As a result, the called
function will function erroneously and may even crash.  A solution to
that is to use the name of the aliased function instead.

17.6 Patching Programs
======================

By default, GDB opens the file containing your program's executable code
(or the corefile) read-only.  This prevents accidental alterations to
machine code; but it also prevents you from intentionally patching your
program's binary.

   If you'd like to be able to patch the binary, you can specify that
explicitly with the 'set write' command.  For example, you might want to
turn on internal debugging flags, or even to make emergency repairs.

'set write on'
'set write off'
     If you specify 'set write on', GDB opens executable and core files
     for both reading and writing; if you specify 'set write off' (the
     default), GDB opens them read-only.

     If you have already loaded a file, you must load it again (using
     the 'exec-file' or 'core-file' command) after changing 'set write',
     for your new setting to take effect.

'show write'
     Display whether executable files and core files are opened for
     writing as well as reading.

18 GDB Files
************

GDB needs to know the file name of the program to be debugged, both in
order to read its symbol table and in order to start your program.  To
debug a core dump of a previous run, you must also tell GDB the name of
the core dump file.

* Menu:

* Files::                       Commands to specify files
* Separate Debug Files::        Debugging information in separate files

18.1 Commands to Specify Files
==============================

You may want to specify executable and core dump file names.  The usual
way to do this is at start-up time, using the arguments to GDB's
start-up commands (*note Getting In and Out of GDB: Invocation.).

   Occasionally it is necessary to change to a different file during a
GDB session.  Or you may run GDB and forget to specify a file you want
to use.  Or you are debugging a remote target via 'gdbserver' (*note
file: Server.).  In these situations the GDB commands to specify new
files are useful.

'file FILENAME'
     Use FILENAME as the program to be debugged.  It is read for its
     symbols and for the contents of pure memory.  It is also the
     program executed when you use the 'run' command.  If you do not
     specify a directory and the file is not found in the GDB working
     directory, GDB uses the environment variable 'PATH' as a list of
     directories to search, just as the shell does when looking for a
     program to run.  You can change the value of this variable, for
     both GDB and your program, using the 'path' command.

     You can load unlinked object '.o' files into GDB using the 'file'
     command.  You will not be able to "run" an object file, but you can
     disassemble functions and inspect variables.  Also, if the
     underlying BFD functionality supports it, you could use 'gdb
     -write' to patch object files using this technique.  Note that GDB
     can neither interpret nor modify relocations in this case, so
     branches and some initialized variables will appear to go to the
     wrong place.  But this feature is still handy from time to time.

'file'
     'file' with no argument makes GDB discard any information it has on
     both executable file and the symbol table.

'exec-file [ FILENAME ]'
     Specify that the program to be run (but not the symbol table) is
     found in FILENAME.  GDB searches the environment variable 'PATH' if
     necessary to locate your program.  Omitting FILENAME means to
     discard information on the executable file.

'symbol-file [ FILENAME ]'
     Read symbol table information from file FILENAME.  'PATH' is
     searched when necessary.  Use the 'file' command to get both symbol
     table and program to run from the same file.

     'symbol-file' with no argument clears out GDB information on your
     program's symbol table.

     The 'symbol-file' command causes GDB to forget the contents of some
     breakpoints and auto-display expressions.  This is because they may
     contain pointers to the internal data recording symbols and data
     types, which are part of the old symbol table data being discarded
     inside GDB.

     'symbol-file' does not repeat if you press <RET> again after
     executing it once.

     When GDB is configured for a particular environment, it understands
     debugging information in whatever format is the standard generated
     for that environment; you may use either a GNU compiler, or other
     compilers that adhere to the local conventions.  Best results are
     usually obtained from GNU compilers; for example, using 'GCC' you
     can generate debugging information for optimized code.

     For most kinds of object files, with the exception of old SVR3
     systems using COFF, the 'symbol-file' command does not normally
     read the symbol table in full right away.  Instead, it scans the
     symbol table quickly to find which source files and which symbols
     are present.  The details are read later, one source file at a
     time, as they are needed.

     The purpose of this two-stage reading strategy is to make GDB start
     up faster.  For the most part, it is invisible except for
     occasional pauses while the symbol table details for a particular
     source file are being read.  (The 'set verbose' command can turn
     these pauses into messages if desired.  *Note Optional Warnings and
     Messages: Messages/Warnings.)

     We have not implemented the two-stage strategy for COFF yet.  When
     the symbol table is stored in COFF format, 'symbol-file' reads the
     symbol table data in full right away.  Note that "stabs-in-COFF"
     still does the two-stage strategy, since the debug info is actually
     in stabs format.

'symbol-file [ -readnow ] FILENAME'
'file [ -readnow ] FILENAME'
     You can override the GDB two-stage strategy for reading symbol
     tables by using the '-readnow' option with any of the commands that
     load symbol table information, if you want to be sure GDB has the
     entire symbol table available.

'core-file [FILENAME]'
'core'
     Specify the whereabouts of a core dump file to be used as the
     "contents of memory".  Traditionally, core files contain only some
     parts of the address space of the process that generated them; GDB
     can access the executable file itself for other parts.

     'core-file' with no argument specifies that no core file is to be
     used.

     Note that the core file is ignored when your program is actually
     running under GDB.  So, if you have been running your program and
     you wish to debug a core file instead, you must kill the subprocess
     in which the program is running.  To do this, use the 'kill'
     command (*note Killing the Child Process: Kill Process.).

'add-symbol-file FILENAME ADDRESS'
'add-symbol-file FILENAME ADDRESS [ -readnow ]'
'add-symbol-file FILENAME ADDRESS -s SECTION ADDRESS ...'
     The 'add-symbol-file' command reads additional symbol table
     information from the file FILENAME.  You would use this command
     when FILENAME has been dynamically loaded (by some other means)
     into the program that is running.  The ADDRESS should give the
     memory address at which the file has been loaded; GDB cannot figure
     this out for itself.  You can additionally specify an arbitrary
     number of '-s SECTION ADDRESS' pairs, to give an explicit section
     name and base address for that section.  You can specify any
     ADDRESS as an expression.

     The symbol table of the file FILENAME is added to the symbol table
     originally read with the 'symbol-file' command.  You can use the
     'add-symbol-file' command any number of times; the new symbol data
     thus read is kept in addition to the old.

     Changes can be reverted using the command 'remove-symbol-file'.

     Although FILENAME is typically a shared library file, an executable
     file, or some other object file which has been fully relocated for
     loading into a process, you can also load symbolic information from
     relocatable '.o' files, as long as:

        * the file's symbolic information refers only to linker symbols
          defined in that file, not to symbols defined by other object
          files,
        * every section the file's symbolic information refers to has
          actually been loaded into the inferior, as it appears in the
          file, and
        * you can determine the address at which every section was
          loaded, and provide these to the 'add-symbol-file' command.

     Some embedded operating systems, like Sun Chorus and VxWorks, can
     load relocatable files into an already running program; such
     systems typically make the requirements above easy to meet.
     However, it's important to recognize that many native systems use
     complex link procedures ('.linkonce' section factoring and C++
     constructor table assembly, for example) that make the requirements
     difficult to meet.  In general, one cannot assume that using
     'add-symbol-file' to read a relocatable object file's symbolic
     information will have the same effect as linking the relocatable
     object file into the program in the normal way.

     'add-symbol-file' does not repeat if you press <RET> after using
     it.

'remove-symbol-file FILENAME'
'remove-symbol-file -a ADDRESS'
     Remove a symbol file added via the 'add-symbol-file' command.  The
     file to remove can be identified by its FILENAME or by an ADDRESS
     that lies within the boundaries of this symbol file in memory.
     Example:

          (gdb) add-symbol-file /home/user/gdb/mylib.so 0x7ffff7ff9480
          add symbol table from file "/home/user/gdb/mylib.so" at
              .text_addr = 0x7ffff7ff9480
          (y or n) y
          Reading symbols from /home/user/gdb/mylib.so...done.
          (gdb) remove-symbol-file -a 0x7ffff7ff9480
          Remove symbol table from file "/home/user/gdb/mylib.so"? (y or n) y
          (gdb)

     'remove-symbol-file' does not repeat if you press <RET> after using
     it.

'add-symbol-file-from-memory ADDRESS'
     Load symbols from the given ADDRESS in a dynamically loaded object
     file whose image is mapped directly into the inferior's memory.
     For example, the Linux kernel maps a 'syscall DSO' into each
     process's address space; this DSO provides kernel-specific code for
     some system calls.  The argument can be any expression whose
     evaluation yields the address of the file's shared object file
     header.  For this command to work, you must have used 'symbol-file'
     or 'exec-file' commands in advance.

'add-shared-symbol-files LIBRARY-FILE'
'assf LIBRARY-FILE'
     This command is deprecated and will be removed in future versions
     of GDB.  Use the 'sharedlibrary' command instead.

     The 'add-shared-symbol-files' command can currently be used only in
     the Cygwin build of GDB on MS-Windows OS, where it is an alias for
     the 'dll-symbols' command (*note Cygwin Native::).  GDB
     automatically looks for shared libraries, however if GDB does not
     find yours, you can invoke 'add-shared-symbol-files'.  It takes one
     argument: the shared library's file name.  'assf' is a shorthand
     alias for 'add-shared-symbol-files'.

'section SECTION ADDR'
     The 'section' command changes the base address of the named SECTION
     of the exec file to ADDR.  This can be used if the exec file does
     not contain section addresses, (such as in the 'a.out' format), or
     when the addresses specified in the file itself are wrong.  Each
     section must be changed separately.  The 'info files' command,
     described below, lists all the sections and their addresses.

'info files'
'info target'
     'info files' and 'info target' are synonymous; both print the
     current target (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.),
     including the names of the executable and core dump files currently
     in use by GDB, and the files from which symbols were loaded.  The
     command 'help target' lists all possible targets rather than
     current ones.

'maint info sections'
     Another command that can give you extra information about program
     sections is 'maint info sections'.  In addition to the section
     information displayed by 'info files', this command displays the
     flags and file offset of each section in the executable and core
     dump files.  In addition, 'maint info sections' provides the
     following command options (which may be arbitrarily combined):

     'ALLOBJ'
          Display sections for all loaded object files, including shared
          libraries.
     'SECTIONS'
          Display info only for named SECTIONS.
     'SECTION-FLAGS'
          Display info only for sections for which SECTION-FLAGS are
          true.  The section flags that GDB currently knows about are:
          'ALLOC'
               Section will have space allocated in the process when
               loaded.  Set for all sections except those containing
               debug information.
          'LOAD'
               Section will be loaded from the file into the child
               process memory.  Set for pre-initialized code and data,
               clear for '.bss' sections.
          'RELOC'
               Section needs to be relocated before loading.
          'READONLY'
               Section cannot be modified by the child process.
          'CODE'
               Section contains executable code only.
          'DATA'
               Section contains data only (no executable code).
          'ROM'
               Section will reside in ROM.
          'CONSTRUCTOR'
               Section contains data for constructor/destructor lists.
          'HAS_CONTENTS'
               Section is not empty.
          'NEVER_LOAD'
               An instruction to the linker to not output the section.
          'COFF_SHARED_LIBRARY'
               A notification to the linker that the section contains
               COFF shared library information.
          'IS_COMMON'
               Section contains common symbols.
'set trust-readonly-sections on'
     Tell GDB that readonly sections in your object file really are
     read-only (i.e. that their contents will not change).  In that
     case, GDB can fetch values from these sections out of the object
     file, rather than from the target program.  For some targets
     (notably embedded ones), this can be a significant enhancement to
     debugging performance.

     The default is off.

'set trust-readonly-sections off'
     Tell GDB not to trust readonly sections.  This means that the
     contents of the section might change while the program is running,
     and must therefore be fetched from the target when needed.

'show trust-readonly-sections'
     Show the current setting of trusting readonly sections.

   All file-specifying commands allow both absolute and relative file
names as arguments.  GDB always converts the file name to an absolute
file name and remembers it that way.

   GDB supports GNU/Linux, MS-Windows, HP-UX, SunOS, SVr4, Irix, and IBM
RS/6000 AIX shared libraries.

   On MS-Windows GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support
shared libraries.  *Note Expat::.

   GDB automatically loads symbol definitions from shared libraries when
you use the 'run' command, or when you examine a core file.  (Before you
issue the 'run' command, GDB does not understand references to a
function in a shared library, however--unless you are debugging a core
file).

   On HP-UX, if the program loads a library explicitly, GDB
automatically loads the symbols at the time of the 'shl_load' call.

   There are times, however, when you may wish to not automatically load
sym
