This
     pass generally, but not always, improves performance and code size,
     at the cost of extra compilation time, which is why there is an
     option to switch it off.  If you have a problem with call
     instructions exceeding their allowable offset range because they
     are conditionalized, you should consider using '-mmedium-calls'
     instead.

'-mearly-cbranchsi'
     Enable pre-reload use of the cbranchsi pattern.

'-mexpand-adddi'
     Expand 'adddi3' and 'subdi3' at rtl generation time into 'add.f',
     'adc' etc.

'-mindexed-loads'
     Enable the use of indexed loads.  This can be problematic because
     some optimizers will then assume the that indexed stores exist,
     which is not the case.

'-mlra'
     Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is still experimental for
     ARC, so by default the compiler uses standard reload (i.e.
     '-mno-lra').

'-mlra-priority-none'
     Don't indicate any priority for target registers.

'-mlra-priority-compact'
     Indicate target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.

'-mlra-priority-noncompact'
     Reduce target regsiter priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.

'-mno-millicode'
     When optimizing for size (using '-Os'), prologues and epilogues
     that have to save or restore a large number of registers are often
     shortened by using call to a special function in libgcc; this is
     referred to as a _millicode_ call.  As these calls can pose
     performance issues, and/or cause linking issues when linking in a
     nonstandard way, this option is provided to turn off millicode call
     generation.

'-mmixed-code'
     Tweak register allocation to help 16-bit instruction generation.
     This generally has the effect of decreasing the average instruction
     size while increasing the instruction count.

'-mq-class'
     Enable 'q' instruction alternatives.  This is the default for
     '-Os'.

'-mRcq'
     Enable Rcq constraint handling - most short code generation depends
     on this.  This is the default.

'-mRcw'
     Enable Rcw constraint handling - ccfsm condexec mostly depends on
     this.  This is the default.

'-msize-level=LEVEL'
     Fine-tune size optimization with regards to instruction lengths and
     alignment.  The recognized values for LEVEL are:
     '0'
          No size optimization.  This level is deprecated and treated
          like '1'.

     '1'
          Short instructions are used opportunistically.

     '2'
          In addition, alignment of loops and of code after barriers are
          dropped.

     '3'
          In addition, optional data alignment is dropped, and the
          option 'Os' is enabled.

     This defaults to '3' when '-Os' is in effect.  Otherwise, the
     behavior when this is not set is equivalent to level '1'.

'-mtune=CPU'
     Set instruction scheduling parameters for CPU, overriding any
     implied by '-mcpu='.

     Supported values for CPU are

     'ARC600'
          Tune for ARC600 cpu.

     'ARC601'
          Tune for ARC601 cpu.

     'ARC700'
          Tune for ARC700 cpu with standard multiplier block.

     'ARC700-xmac'
          Tune for ARC700 cpu with XMAC block.

     'ARC725D'
          Tune for ARC725D cpu.

     'ARC750D'
          Tune for ARC750D cpu.

'-mmultcost=NUM'
     Cost to assume for a multiply instruction, with '4' being equal to
     a normal instruction.

'-munalign-prob-threshold=PROBABILITY'
     Set probability threshold for unaligning branches.  When tuning for
     'ARC700' and optimizing for speed, branches without filled delay
     slot are preferably emitted unaligned and long, unless profiling
     indicates that the probability for the branch to be taken is below
     PROBABILITY.  *Note Cross-profiling::.  The default is
     (REG_BR_PROB_BASE/2), i.e. 5000.

 The following options are maintained for backward compatibility, but
are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

'-margonaut'
     Obsolete FPX.

'-mbig-endian'
'-EB'
     Compile code for big endian targets.  Use of these options is now
     deprecated.  Users wanting big-endian code, should use the 'arceb-elf32'
     and 'arceb-linux-uclibc' targets when building the tool chain, for
     which big-endian is the default.

'-mlittle-endian'
'-EL'
     Compile code for little endian targets.  Use of these options is
     now deprecated.  Users wanting little-endian code should use the 'arc-elf32'
     and 'arc-linux-uclibc' targets when building the tool chain, for
     which little-endian is the default.

'-mbarrel_shifter'
     Replaced by '-mbarrel-shifter'

'-mdpfp_compact'
     Replaced by '-mdpfp-compact'

'-mdpfp_fast'
     Replaced by '-mdpfp-fast'

'-mdsp_packa'
     Replaced by '-mdsp-packa'

'-mspfp_fast'
     Replaced by '-mspfp-fast'

'-mtune=CPU'
     Values 'arc600', 'arc601', 'arc700' and 'arc700-xmac' for CPU are
     replaced by 'ARC600', 'ARC601', 'ARC700' and 'ARC700-xmac'
     respectively

'-multcost=NUM'
     Replaced by '-mmultcost'.

3.17.4 ARM Options
------------------

These '-m' options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:

'-mabi=NAME'
     Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are:
     'apcs-gnu', 'atpcs', 'aapcs', 'aapcs-linux' and 'iwmmxt'.

'-mapcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure
     Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly
     necessary for correct execution of the code.  Specifying
     '-fomit-frame-pointer' with this option causes the stack frames not
     to be generated for leaf functions.  The default is
     '-mno-apcs-frame'.

'-mapcs'
     This is a synonym for '-mapcs-frame'.

'-mthumb-interwork'
     Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
     instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre-v5 architectures,
     the two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one
     program.  The default is '-mno-thumb-interwork', since slightly
     larger code is generated when '-mthumb-interwork' is specified.  In
     AAPCS configurations this option is meaningless.

'-mno-sched-prolog'
     Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or
     the merging of those instruction with the instructions in the
     function's body.  This means that all functions start with a
     recognizable set of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a
     small set of different function prologues), and this information
     can be used to locate the start of functions inside an executable
     piece of code.  The default is '-msched-prolog'.

'-mfloat-abi=NAME'
     Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values are:
     'soft', 'softfp' and 'hard'.

     Specifying 'soft' causes GCC to generate output containing library
     calls for floating-point operations.  'softfp' allows the
     generation of code using hardware floating-point instructions, but
     still uses the soft-float calling conventions.  'hard' allows
     generation of floating-point instructions and uses FPU-specific
     calling conventions.

     The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note
     that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible;
     you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link
     with a compatible set of libraries.

'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This
     is the default for all standard configurations.

'-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the
     default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.

'-mwords-little-endian'
     This option only applies when generating code for big-endian
     processors.  Generate code for a little-endian word order but a
     big-endian byte order.  That is, a byte order of the form
     '32107654'.  Note: this option should only be used if you require
     compatibility with code for big-endian ARM processors generated by
     versions of the compiler prior to 2.8.  This option is now
     deprecated.

'-march=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses
     this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
     generating assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction
     with or instead of the '-mcpu=' option.  Permissible names are:
     'armv2', 'armv2a', 'armv3', 'armv3m', 'armv4', 'armv4t', 'armv5',
     'armv5t', 'armv5e', 'armv5te', 'armv6', 'armv6j', 'armv6t2',
     'armv6z', 'armv6zk', 'armv6-m', 'armv7', 'armv7-a', 'armv7-r',
     'armv7-m', 'armv7e-m', 'armv7ve', 'armv8-a', 'armv8-a+crc',
     'iwmmxt', 'iwmmxt2', 'ep9312'.

     '-march=armv7ve' is the armv7-a architecture with virtualization
     extensions.

     '-march=armv8-a+crc' enables code generation for the ARMv8-A
     architecture together with the optional CRC32 extensions.

     '-march=native' causes the compiler to auto-detect the architecture
     of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported
     on GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the
     auto-detect is unsuccessful the option has no effect.

'-mtune=NAME'
     This option specifies the name of the target ARM processor for
     which GCC should tune the performance of the code.  For some ARM
     implementations better performance can be obtained by using this
     option.  Permissible names are: 'arm2', 'arm250', 'arm3', 'arm6',
     'arm60', 'arm600', 'arm610', 'arm620', 'arm7', 'arm7m', 'arm7d',
     'arm7dm', 'arm7di', 'arm7dmi', 'arm70', 'arm700', 'arm700i',
     'arm710', 'arm710c', 'arm7100', 'arm720', 'arm7500', 'arm7500fe',
     'arm7tdmi', 'arm7tdmi-s', 'arm710t', 'arm720t', 'arm740t',
     'strongarm', 'strongarm110', 'strongarm1100', 'strongarm1110',
     'arm8', 'arm810', 'arm9', 'arm9e', 'arm920', 'arm920t', 'arm922t',
     'arm946e-s', 'arm966e-s', 'arm968e-s', 'arm926ej-s', 'arm940t',
     'arm9tdmi', 'arm10tdmi', 'arm1020t', 'arm1026ej-s', 'arm10e',
     'arm1020e', 'arm1022e', 'arm1136j-s', 'arm1136jf-s', 'mpcore',
     'mpcorenovfp', 'arm1156t2-s', 'arm1156t2f-s', 'arm1176jz-s',
     'arm1176jzf-s', 'cortex-a5', 'cortex-a7', 'cortex-a8', 'cortex-a9',
     'cortex-a12', 'cortex-a15', 'cortex-a53', 'cortex-a57',
     'cortex-r4', 'cortex-r4f', 'cortex-r5', 'cortex-r7', 'cortex-m4',
     'cortex-m3', 'cortex-m1', 'cortex-m0', 'cortex-m0plus',
     'marvell-pj4', 'xscale', 'iwmmxt', 'iwmmxt2', 'ep9312', 'fa526',
     'fa626', 'fa606te', 'fa626te', 'fmp626', 'fa726te'.

     Additionally, this option can specify that GCC should tune the
     performance of the code for a big.LITTLE system.  Permissible names
     are: 'cortex-a15.cortex-a7', 'cortex-a57.cortex-a53'.

     '-mtune=generic-ARCH' specifies that GCC should tune the
     performance for a blend of processors within architecture ARCH.
     The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most
     popular processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit
     some CPUs in the range, and avoiding performance pitfalls of other
     CPUs.  The effects of this option may change in future GCC versions
     as CPU models come and go.

     '-mtune=native' causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the
     build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
     GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the
     auto-detect is unsuccessful the option has no effect.

'-mcpu=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this
     name to derive the name of the target ARM architecture (as if
     specified by '-march') and the ARM processor type for which to tune
     for performance (as if specified by '-mtune').  Where this option
     is used in conjunction with '-march' or '-mtune', those options
     take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.

     Permissible names for this option are the same as those for
     '-mtune'.

     '-mcpu=generic-ARCH' is also permissible, and is equivalent to
     '-march=ARCH -mtune=generic-ARCH'.  See '-mtune' for more
     information.

     '-mcpu=native' causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the
     build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
     GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the
     auto-detect is unsuccessful the option has no effect.

'-mfpu=NAME'
     This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation)
     is available on the target.  Permissible names are: 'vfp', 'vfpv3',
     'vfpv3-fp16', 'vfpv3-d16', 'vfpv3-d16-fp16', 'vfpv3xd',
     'vfpv3xd-fp16', 'neon', 'neon-fp16', 'vfpv4', 'vfpv4-d16',
     'fpv4-sp-d16', 'neon-vfpv4', 'fp-armv8', 'neon-fp-armv8', and
     'crypto-neon-fp-armv8'.

     If '-msoft-float' is specified this specifies the format of
     floating-point values.

     If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON extension
     (e.g.  '-mfpu'='neon'), note that floating-point operations are not
     generated by GCC's auto-vectorization pass unless
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is also specified.  This is because
     NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for
     floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are
     treated as zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a
     loss of precision.

'-mfp16-format=NAME'
     Specify the format of the '__fp16' half-precision floating-point
     type.  Permissible names are 'none', 'ieee', and 'alternative'; the
     default is 'none', in which case the '__fp16' type is not defined.
     *Note Half-Precision::, for more information.

'-mstructure-size-boundary=N'
     The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
     of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are
     8, 32 and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.
     For the COFF targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of
     64 is only allowed if the underlying ABI supports it.

     Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code,
     but can also increase the size of the program.  Different values
     are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot
     necessarily expect to work with code or libraries compiled with
     another value, if they exchange information using structures or
     unions.

'-mabort-on-noreturn'
     Generate a call to the function 'abort' at the end of a 'noreturn'
     function.  It is executed if the function tries to return.

'-mlong-calls'
'-mno-long-calls'
     Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
     address of the function into a register and then performing a
     subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the
     target function lies outside of the 64-megabyte addressing range of
     the offset-based version of subroutine call instruction.

     Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
     into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
     that have the 'short-call' attribute, functions that are inside the
     scope of a '#pragma no_long_calls' directive, and functions whose
     definitions have already been compiled within the current
     compilation unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to
     this rule are that weak function definitions, functions with the
     'long-call' attribute or the 'section' attribute, and functions
     that are within the scope of a '#pragma long_calls' directive are
     always turned into long calls.

     This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
     '-mno-long-calls' restores the default behavior, as does placing
     the function calls within the scope of a '#pragma long_calls_off'
     directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how the compiler
     generates code to handle function calls via function pointers.

'-msingle-pic-base'
     Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather
     than loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime
     system is responsible for initializing this register with an
     appropriate value before execution begins.

'-mpic-register=REG'
     Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  For standard
     PIC base case, the default will be any suitable register determined
     by compiler.  For single PIC base case, the default is 'R9' if
     target is EABI based or stack-checking is enabled, otherwise the
     default is 'R10'.

'-mpic-data-is-text-relative'
     Assume that each data segments are relative to text segment at load
     time.  Therefore, it permits addressing data using PC-relative
     operations.  This option is on by default for targets other than
     VxWorks RTP.

'-mpoke-function-name'
     Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
     preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to
     this:

               t0
                   .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                   .align
               t1
                   .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
               arm_poke_function_name
                   mov     ip, sp
                   stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                   sub     fp, ip, #4

     When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
     'pc' stored at 'fp + 0'.  If the trace function then looks at
     location 'pc - 12' and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
     there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this
     location and has length '((pc[-3]) & 0xff000000)'.

'-mthumb'
'-marm'

     Select between generating code that executes in ARM and Thumb
     states.  The default for most configurations is to generate code
     that executes in ARM state, but the default can be changed by
     configuring GCC with the '--with-mode='STATE configure option.

'-mtpcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
     Call Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one
     that does not call any other functions.)  The default is
     '-mno-tpcs-frame'.

'-mtpcs-leaf-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure
     Call Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that
     does not call any other functions.)  The default is
     '-mno-apcs-leaf-frame'.

'-mcallee-super-interworking'
     Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled
     an ARM instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before
     executing the rest of the function.  This allows these functions to
     be called from non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in
     AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled by default.

'-mcaller-super-interworking'
     Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
     execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
     compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the
     cost of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.
     This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations because
     interworking is enabled by default.

'-mtp=NAME'
     Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The
     valid models are 'soft', which generates calls to
     '__aeabi_read_tp', 'cp15', which fetches the thread pointer from
     'cp15' directly (supported in the arm6k architecture), and 'auto',
     which uses the best available method for the selected processor.
     The default setting is 'auto'.

'-mtls-dialect=DIALECT'
     Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
     DIALECTs are supported--'gnu' and 'gnu2'.  The 'gnu' dialect
     selects the original GNU scheme for supporting local and global
     dynamic TLS models.  The 'gnu2' dialect selects the GNU descriptor
     scheme, which provides better performance for shared libraries.
     The GNU descriptor scheme is compatible with the original scheme,
     but does require new assembler, linker and library support.
     Initial and local exec TLS models are unaffected by this option and
     always use the original scheme.

'-mword-relocations'
     Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e.
     R_ARM_ABS32).  This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux,
     SymbianOS) where the runtime loader imposes this restriction, and
     when '-fpic' or '-fPIC' is specified.

'-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd'
     Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when 'ldrd'
     instructions with overlapping destination and base registers are
     used.  This option avoids generating these instructions.  This
     option is enabled by default when '-mcpu=cortex-m3' is specified.

'-munaligned-access'
'-mno-unaligned-access'
     Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit values
     from addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned.  By default
     unaligned access is disabled for all pre-ARMv6 and all ARMv6-M
     architectures, and enabled for all other architectures.  If
     unaligned access is not enabled then words in packed data
     structures will be accessed a byte at a time.

     The ARM attribute 'Tag_CPU_unaligned_access' will be set in the
     generated object file to either true or false, depending upon the
     setting of this option.  If unaligned access is enabled then the
     preprocessor symbol '__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED' will also be defined.

'-mneon-for-64bits'
     Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations.  This is
     disabled by default since the cost of moving data from core
     registers to Neon is high.

'-mslow-flash-data'
     Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching instruction.
     Therefore literal load is minimized for better performance.  This
     option is only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile and off
     by default.

'-mrestrict-it'
     Restricts generation of IT blocks to conform to the rules of ARMv8.
     IT blocks can only contain a single 16-bit instruction from a
     select set of instructions.  This option is on by default for ARMv8
     Thumb mode.


File: gcc.info,  Node: AVR Options,  Next: Blackfin Options,  Prev: ARM Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.5 AVR Options
------------------

These options are defined for AVR implementations:

'-mmcu=MCU'
     Specify Atmel AVR instruction set architectures (ISA) or MCU type.

     The default for this option is 'avr2'.

     GCC supports the following AVR devices and ISAs:

     'avr2'
          "Classic" devices with up to 8 KiB of program memory.

'-maccumulate-args'
     Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release the
     needed stack space for outgoing function arguments once in function
     prologue/epilogue.  Without this option, outgoing arguments are
     pushed before calling a function and popped afterwards.

     Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on
     AVR so that accumulating the stack space might lead to smaller
     executables because arguments need not to be removed from the stack
     after such a function call.

     This option can lead to reduced code size for functions that
     perform several calls to functions that get their arguments on the
     stack like calls to printf-like functions.

'-mbranch-cost=COST'
     Set the branch costs for conditional branch instructions to COST.
     Reasonable values for COST are small, non-negative integers.  The
     default branch cost is 0.

'-mcall-prologues'
     Functions prologues/epilogues are expanded as calls to appropriate
     subroutines.  Code size is smaller.

'-mint8'
     Assume 'int' to be 8-bit integer.  This affects the sizes of all
     types: a 'char' is 1 byte, an 'int' is 1 byte, a 'long' is 2 bytes,
     and 'long long' is 4 bytes.  Please note that this option does not
     conform to the C standards, but it results in smaller code size.

'-mno-interrupts'
     Generated code is not compatible with hardware interrupts.  Code
     size is smaller.

'-mrelax'
     Try to replace 'CALL' resp. 'JMP' instruction by the shorter
     'RCALL' resp. 'RJMP' instruction if applicable.  Setting '-mrelax'
     just adds the '--relax' option to the linker command line when the
     linker is called.

     Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are
     not known before code is located.  Therefore, the assembler code
     generated by the compiler is the same, but the instructions in the
     executable may differ from instructions in the assembler code.

     Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see the
     section on 'EIND' and linker stubs below.

'-msp8'
     Treat the stack pointer register as an 8-bit register, i.e. assume
     the high byte of the stack pointer is zero.  In general, you don't
     need to set this option by hand.

     This option is used internally by the compiler to select and build
     multilibs for architectures 'avr2' and 'avr25'.  These
     architectures mix devices with and without 'SPH'.  For any setting
     other than '-mmcu=avr2' or '-mmcu=avr25' the compiler driver will
     add or remove this option from the compiler proper's command line,
     because the compiler then knows if the device or architecture has
     an 8-bit stack pointer and thus no 'SPH' register or not.

'-mstrict-X'
     Use address register 'X' in a way proposed by the hardware.  This
     means that 'X' is only used in indirect, post-increment or
     pre-decrement addressing.

     Without this option, the 'X' register may be used in the same way
     as 'Y' or 'Z' which then is emulated by additional instructions.
     For example, loading a value with 'X+const' addressing with a small
     non-negative 'const < 64' to a register RN is performed as

          adiw r26, const   ; X += const
          ld   RN, X        ; RN = *X
          sbiw r26, const   ; X -= const

'-mtiny-stack'
     Only change the lower 8 bits of the stack pointer.

'-Waddr-space-convert'
     Warn about conversions between address spaces in the case where the
     resulting address space is not contained in the incoming address
     space.

3.17.5.1 'EIND' and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash
................................................................

Pointers in the implementation are 16 bits wide.  The address of a
function or label is represented as word address so that indirect jumps
and calls can target any code address in the range of 64 Ki words.

 In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128 Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register
called 'EIND' that serves as most significant part of the target address
when 'EICALL' or 'EIJMP' instructions are used.

 Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by the
compiler and are subject to some limitations:

   * The compiler never sets 'EIND'.

   * The compiler uses 'EIND' implicitely in 'EICALL'/'EIJMP'
     instructions or might read 'EIND' directly in order to emulate an
     indirect call/jump by means of a 'RET' instruction.

   * The compiler assumes that 'EIND' never changes during the startup
     code or during the application.  In particular, 'EIND' is not
     saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
     prologue/epilogue.

   * For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
     generates _stubs_.  Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
     _trampolines_.  Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
     The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.

   * Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker will
     generate the stubs correctly an all situaltion.  See the compiler
     option '-mrelax' and the linler option '--relax'.  There are corner
     cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs but aborts
     without relaxation and without a helpful error message.

   * The default linker script is arranged for code with 'EIND = 0'.  If
     code is supposed to work for a setup with 'EIND != 0', a custom
     linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
     name start with '.trampolines' into the segment where 'EIND' points
     to.

   * The startup code from libgcc never sets 'EIND'.  Notice that
     startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC. For the
     impact of AVR-LibC on 'EIND', see the
     AVR-LibC user manual (http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/).

   * It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up 'EIND'
     early, for example by means of initialization code located in
     section '.init3'.  Such code runs prior to general startup code
     that initializes RAM and calls constructors, but after the bit of
     startup code from AVR-LibC that sets 'EIND' to the segment where
     the vector table is located.
          #include <avr/io.h>

          static void
          __attribute__((section(".init3"),naked,used,no_instrument_function))
          init3_set_eind (void)
          {
            __asm volatile ("ldi r24,pm_hh8(__trampolines_start)\n\t"
                            "out %i0,r24" :: "n" (&EIND) : "r24","memory");
          }

     The '__trampolines_start' symbol is defined in the linker script.

   * Stubs are generated automatically by the linker if the following
     two conditions are met:

        - The address of a label is taken by means of the 'gs' modifier
          (short for _generate stubs_) like so:
               LDI r24, lo8(gs(FUNC))
               LDI r25, hi8(gs(FUNC))
        - The final location of that label is in a code segment
          _outside_ the segment where the stubs are located.

   * The compiler emits such 'gs' modifiers for code labels in the
     following situations:
        - Taking address of a function or code label.
        - Computed goto.
        - If prologue-save function is used, see '-mcall-prologues'
          command-line option.
        - Switch/case dispatch tables.  If you do not want such dispatch
          tables you can specify the '-fno-jump-tables' command-line
          option.
        - C and C++ constructors/destructors called during
          startup/shutdown.
        - If the tools hit a 'gs()' modifier explained above.

   * Jumping to non-symbolic addresses like so is _not_ supported:

          int main (void)
          {
              /* Call function at word address 0x2 */
              return ((int(*)(void)) 0x2)();
          }

     Instead, a stub has to be set up, i.e. the function has to be
     called through a symbol ('func_4' in the example):

          int main (void)
          {
              extern int func_4 (void);

              /* Call function at byte address 0x4 */
              return func_4();
          }

     and the application be linked with '-Wl,--defsym,func_4=0x4'.
     Alternatively, 'func_4' can be defined in the linker script.

3.17.5.2 Handling of the 'RAMPD', 'RAMPX', 'RAMPY' and 'RAMPZ' Special Function Registers
.........................................................................................

Some AVR devices support memories larger than the 64 KiB range that can
be accessed with 16-bit pointers.  To access memory locations outside
this 64 KiB range, the contentent of a 'RAMP' register is used as high
part of the address: The 'X', 'Y', 'Z' address register is concatenated
with the 'RAMPX', 'RAMPY', 'RAMPZ' special function register,
respectively, to get a wide address.  Similarly, 'RAMPD' is used
together with direct addressing.

   * The startup code initializes the 'RAMP' special function registers
     with zero.

   * If a *note named address space: AVR Named Address Spaces. other
     than generic or '__flash' is used, then 'RAMPZ' is set as needed
     before the operation.

   * If the device supports RAM larger than 64 KiB and the compiler
     needs to change 'RAMPZ' to accomplish an operation, 'RAMPZ' is
     reset to zero after the operation.

   * If the device comes with a specific 'RAMP' register, the ISR
     prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it with
     zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.

   * RAM larger than 64 KiB is not supported by GCC for AVR targets.  If
     you use inline assembler to read from locations outside the 16-bit
     address range and change one of the 'RAMP' registers, you must
     reset it to zero after the access.

3.17.5.3 AVR Built-in Macros
............................

GCC defines several built-in macros so that the user code can test for
the presence or absence of features.  Almost any of the following
built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities and thus triggered
by the '-mmcu=' command-line option.

 For even more AVR-specific built-in macros see *note AVR Named Address
Spaces:: and *note AVR Built-in Functions::.

'__AVR_ARCH__'
     Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that identifies
     the architecture and depends on the '-mmcu=MCU' option.  Possible
     values are:

     '2', '25', '3', '31', '35', '4', '5', '51', '6', '102', '104',
     '105', '106', '107'

     for MCU='avr2', 'avr25', 'avr3', 'avr31', 'avr35', 'avr4', 'avr5',
     'avr51', 'avr6', 'avrxmega2', 'avrxmega4', 'avrxmega5',
     'avrxmega6', 'avrxmega7', respectively.  If MCU specifies a device,
     this built-in macro is set accordingly.  For example, with
     '-mmcu=atmega8' the macro will be defined to '4'.

'__AVR_DEVICE__'
     Setting '-mmcu=DEVICE' defines this built-in macro which reflects
     the device's name.  For example, '-mmcu=atmega8' defines the
     built-in macro '__AVR_ATmega8__', '-mmcu=attiny261a' defines
     '__AVR_ATtiny261A__', etc.

     The built-in macros' names follow the scheme '__AVR_DEVICE__' where
     DEVICE is the device name as from the AVR user manual.  The
     difference between DEVICE in the built-in macro and DEVICE in
     '-mmcu=DEVICE' is that the latter is always lowercase.

     If DEVICE is not a device but only a core architecture like
     'avr51', this macro will not be defined.

'__AVR_XMEGA__'
     The device / architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of devices.

'__AVR_HAVE_ELPM__'
     The device has the the 'ELPM' instruction.

'__AVR_HAVE_ELPMX__'
     The device has the 'ELPM RN,Z' and 'ELPM RN,Z+' instructions.

'__AVR_HAVE_MOVW__'
     The device has the 'MOVW' instruction to perform 16-bit
     register-register moves.

'__AVR_HAVE_LPMX__'
     The device has the 'LPM RN,Z' and 'LPM RN,Z+' instructions.

'__AVR_HAVE_MUL__'
     The device has a hardware multiplier.

'__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__'
     The device has the 'JMP' and 'CALL' instructions.  This is the case
     for devices with at least 16 KiB of program memory.

'__AVR_HAVE_EIJMP_EICALL__'
'__AVR_3_BYTE_PC__'
     The device has the 'EIJMP' and 'EICALL' instructions.  This is the
     case for devices with more than 128 KiB of program memory.  This
     also means that the program counter (PC) is 3 bytes wide.

'__AVR_2_BYTE_PC__'
     The program counter (PC) is 2 bytes wide.  This is the case for
     devices with up to 128 KiB of program memory.

'__AVR_HAVE_8BIT_SP__'
'__AVR_HAVE_16BIT_SP__'
     The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit respectively
     16-bit register by the compiler.  The definition of these macros is
     affected by '-mtiny-stack'.

'__AVR_HAVE_SPH__'
'__AVR_SP8__'
     The device has the SPH (high part of stack pointer) special
     function register or has an 8-bit stack pointer, respectively.  The
     definition of these macros is affected by '-mmcu=' and in the cases
     of '-mmcu=avr2' and '-mmcu=avr25' also by '-msp8'.

'__AVR_HAVE_RAMPD__'
'__AVR_HAVE_RAMPX__'
'__AVR_HAVE_RAMPY__'
'__AVR_HAVE_RAMPZ__'
     The device has the 'RAMPD', 'RAMPX', 'RAMPY', 'RAMPZ' special
     function register, respectively.

'__NO_INTERRUPTS__'
     This macro reflects the '-mno-interrupts' command line option.

'__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP__'
'__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP_JMP_CALL__'
     Some AVR devices (AT90S8515, ATmega103) must not skip 32-bit
     instructions because of a hardware erratum.  Skip instructions are
     'SBRS', 'SBRC', 'SBIS', 'SBIC' and 'CPSE'.  The second macro is
     only defined if '__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__' is also set.

'__AVR_ISA_RMW__'
     The device has Read-Modify-Write instructions (XCH, LAC, LAS and
     LAT).

'__AVR_SFR_OFFSET__=OFFSET'
     Instructions that can address I/O special function registers
     directly like 'IN', 'OUT', 'SBI', etc. may use a different address
     as if addressed by an instruction to access RAM like 'LD' or 'STS'.
     This offset depends on the device architecture and has to be
     subtracted from the RAM address in order to get the respective
     I/O address.

'__WITH_AVRLIBC__'
     The compiler is configured to be used together with AVR-Libc.  See
     the '--with-avrlibc' configure option.

3.17.6 Blackfin Options
-----------------------

'-mcpu=CPU[-SIREVISION]'
     Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.  Currently,
     CPU can be one of 'bf512', 'bf514', 'bf516', 'bf518', 'bf522',
     'bf523', 'bf524', 'bf525', 'bf526', 'bf527', 'bf531', 'bf532',
     'bf533', 'bf534', 'bf536', 'bf537', 'bf538', 'bf539', 'bf542',
     'bf544', 'bf547', 'bf548', 'bf549', 'bf542m', 'bf544m', 'bf547m',
     'bf548m', 'bf549m', 'bf561', 'bf592'.

     The optional SIREVISION specifies the silicon revision of the
     target Blackfin processor.  Any workarounds available for the
     targeted silicon revision are enabled.  If SIREVISION is 'none', no
     workarounds are enabled.  If SIREVISION is 'any', all workarounds
     for the targeted processor are enabled.  The '__SILICON_REVISION__'
     macro is defined to two hexadecimal digits representing the major
     and minor numbers in the silicon revision.  If SIREVISION is
     'none', the '__SILICON_REVISION__' is not defined.  If SIREVISION
     is 'any', the '__SILICON_REVISION__' is defined to be '0xffff'.  If
     this optional SIREVISION is not used, GCC assumes the latest known
     silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin processor.

     GCC defines a preprocessor macro for the specified CPU.  For the
     'bfin-elf' toolchain, this option causes the hardware BSP provided
     by libgloss to be linked in if '-msim' is not given.

     Without this option, 'bf532' is used as the processor by default.

     Note that support for 'bf561' is incomplete.  For 'bf561', only the
     preprocessor macro is defined.

'-msim'
     Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This
     causes the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be linked in.
     This option has effect only for 'bfin-elf' toolchain.  Certain
     other options, such as '-mid-shared-library' and '-mfdpic', imply
     '-msim'.

'-momit-leaf-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.
     This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame
     pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.
     The option '-fomit-frame-pointer' removes the frame pointer for all
     functions, which might make debugging harder.

'-mspecld-anomaly'
     When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
     contain speculative loads after jump instructions.  If this option
     is used, '__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS' is defined.

'-mno-specld-anomaly'
     Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from
     occurring.

'-mcsync-anomaly'
     When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
     contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon after conditional
     branches.  If this option is used, '__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS'
     is defined.

'-mno-csync-anomaly'
     Don't generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC instructions
     from occurring too soon after a conditional branch.

'-mlow-64k'
     When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the
     knowledge that the entire program fits into the low 64k of memory.

'-mno-low-64k'
     Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the default.

'-mstack-check-l1'
     Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad
     memory by the uClinux kernel.

'-mid-shared-library'
     Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID
     method.  This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in
     an environment without virtual memory management.  This option
     implies '-fPIC'.  With a 'bfin-elf' target, this option implies
     '-msim'.

'-mno-id-shared-library'
     Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are
     being used.  This is the default.

'-mleaf-id-shared-library'
     Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID
     method, but assumes that this library or executable won't link
     against any other ID shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to
     use faster code for jumps and calls.

'-mno-leaf-id-shared-library'
     Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any
     ID shared libraries.  Slower code is generated for jump and call
     insns.

'-mshared-library-id=n'
     Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library
     being compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact
     code; specifying other values forces the allocation of that number
     to the current library but is no more space- or time-efficient than
     omitting this option.

'-msep-data'
     Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a
     different area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for
     execute in place in an environment without virtual memory
     management by eliminating relocations against the text section.

'-mno-sep-data'
     Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text
     segment.  This is the default.

'-mlong-calls'
'-mno-long-calls'
     Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
     address of the function into a register and then performing a
     subroutine call on this register.  This switch is needed if the
     target function lies outside of the 24-bit addressing range of the
     offset-based version of subroutine call instruction.

     This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
     '-mno-long-calls' restores the default behavior.  Note these
     switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to
     handle function calls via function pointers.

'-mfast-fp'
     Link with the fast floating-point library.  This library relaxes
     some of the IEEE floating-point standard's rules for checking
     inputs against Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest of performance.

'-minline-plt'
     Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that
     are not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without '-mfdpic'.

'-mmulticore'
     Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin processors.
     This option causes proper start files and link scripts supporting
     multicore to be used, and defines the macro '__BFIN_MULTICORE'.  It
     can only be used with '-mcpu=bf561[-SIREVISION]'.

     This option can be used with '-mcorea' or '-mcoreb', which selects
     the one-application-per-core programming model.  Without '-mcorea'
     or '-mcoreb', the single-application/dual-core programming model is
     used.  In this model, the main function of Core B should be named
     as 'coreb_main'.

     If this option is not used, the single-core application programming
     model is used.

'-mcorea'
     Build a standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using the
     one-application-per-core programming model.  Proper start files and
     link scripts are used to support Core A, and the macro
     '__BFIN_COREA' is defined.  This option can only be used in
     conjunction with '-mmulticore'.

'-mcoreb'
     Build a standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using the
     one-application-per-core programming model.  Proper start files and
     link scripts are used to support Core B, and the macro
     '__BFIN_COREB' is defined.  When this option is used, 'coreb_main'
     should be used instead of 'main'.  This option can only be used in
     conjunction with '-mmulticore'.

'-msdram'
     Build a standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files and
     link scripts are used to put the application into SDRAM, and the
     macro '__BFIN_SDRAM' is defined.  The loader should initialize
     SDRAM before loading the application.

'-micplb'
     Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time.  This has an effect on
     certain anomaly workarounds.  For Linux targets, the default is to
     assume ICPLBs are enabled; for standalone applications the default
     is off.


File: gcc.info,  Node: C6X Options,  Next: CRIS Options,  Prev: Blackfin Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.7 C6X Options
------------------

'-march=NAME'
     This specifies the name of the target architecture.  GCC uses this
     name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
     generating assembly code.  Permissible names are: 'c62x', 'c64x',
     'c64x+', 'c67x', 'c67x+', 'c674x'.

'-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a big-endian target.

'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the default.

'-msim'
     Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.

'-msdata=default'
     Put small global and static data in the '.neardata' section, which
     is pointed to by register 'B14'.  Put small uninitialized global
     and static data in the '.bss' section, which is adjacent to the
     '.neardata' section.  Put small read-only data into the '.rodata'
     section.  The corresponding sections used for large pieces of data
     are '.fardata', '.far' and '.const'.

'-msdata=all'
     Put all data, not just small objects, into PK
     cOx:      	   1/1.z2194the sections reserved
     for small data, and use addressing relative to the 'B14' register
     to access them.

'-msdata=none'
     Make no use of the sections reserved for small data, and use
     absolute addresses to access all data.  Put all initialized global
     and static data in the '.fardata' section, and all uninitialized
     data in the '.far' section.  Put all constant data into the
     '.const' section.


File: gcc.info,  Node: CRIS Options,  Next: CR16 Options,  Prev: C6X Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.8 CRIS Options
-------------------

These options are defined specifically for the CRIS ports.

'-march=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
'-mcpu=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
     Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
     ARCHITECTURE-TYPE are 'v3', 'v8' and 'v10' for respectively
     ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX.  Default is 'v0' except for
     cris-axis-linux-gnu, where the default is 'v10'.

'-mtune=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
     Tune to ARCHITECTURE-TYPE everything applicable about the generated
     code, except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.
     The choices for ARCHITECTURE-TYPE are the same as for
     '-march=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'.

'-mmax-stack-frame=N'
     Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds N bytes.

'-metrax4'
'-metrax100'
     The options '-metrax4' and '-metrax100' are synonyms for
     '-march=v3' and '-march=v8' respectively.

'-mmul-bug-workaround'
'-mno-mul-bug-workaround'
     Work around a bug in the 'muls' and 'mulu' instructions for CPU
     models where it applies.  This option is active by default.

'-mpdebug'
     Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in the
     assembly code.  This option also has the effect of turning off the
     '#NO_APP' formatted-code indicator to the assembler at the
     beginning of the assembly file.

'-mcc-init'
     Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction; always
     emit compare and test instructions before use of condition codes.

'-mno-side-effects'
     Do not emit instructions with side effects in addressing modes
     other than post-increment.

'-mstack-align'
'-mno-stack-align'
'-mdata-align'
'-mno-data-align'
'-mconst-align'
'-mno-const-align'
     These options ('no-' options) arrange (eliminate arrangements) for
     the stack frame, individual data and constants to be aligned for
     the maximum single data access size for the chosen CPU model.  The
     default is to arrange for 32-bit alignment.  ABI details such as
     structure layout are not affected by these options.

'-m32-bit'
'-m16-bit'
'-m8-bit'
     Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above, these
     options arrange for stack frame, writable data and constants to all
     be 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The default is 32-bit
     alignment.

'-mno-prologue-epilogue'
'-mprologue-epilogue'
     With '-mno-prologue-epilogue', the normal function prologue and
     epilogue which set up the stack frame are omitted and no return
     instructions or return sequences are generated in the code.  Use
     this option only together with visual inspection of the compiled
     code: no warnings or errors are generated when call-saved registers
     must be saved, or storage for local variables needs to be
     allocated.

'-mno-gotplt'
'-mgotplt'
     With '-fpic' and '-fPIC', don't generate (do generate) instruction
     sequences that load addresses for functions from the PLT part of
     the GOT rather than (traditional on other architectures) calls to
     the PLT.  The default is '-mgotplt'.

'-melf'
     Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf and
     cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.

'-mlinux'
     Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-linux-gnu
     target.

'-sim'
     This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf, arranges to link
     with input-output functions from a simulator library.  Code,
     initialized data and zero-initialized data are allocated
     consecutively.

'-sim2'
     Like '-sim', but pass linker options to locate initialized data at
     0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at 0x80000000.

3.17.9 CR16 Options
-------------------

These options are defined specifically for the CR16 ports.

'-mmac'
     Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions.  Disabled by
     default.

'-mcr16cplus'
'-mcr16c'
     Generate code for CR16C or CR16C+ architecture.  CR16C+
     architecture is default.

'-msim'
     Links the library libsim.a which is in compatible with simulator.
     Applicable to ELF compiler only.

'-mint32'
     Choose integer type as 32-bit wide.

'-mbit-ops'
     Generates 'sbit'/'cbit' instructions for bit manipulations.

'-mdata-model=MODEL'
     Choose a data model.  The choices for MODEL are 'near', 'far' or
     'medium'.  'medium' is default.  However, 'far' is not valid with
     '-mcr16c', as the CR16C architecture does not support the far data
     model.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Darwin Options,  Next: DEC Alpha Options,  Prev: CR16 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.10 Darwin Options
----------------------

These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin
operating system.

 FSF GCC on Darwin does not create "fat" object files; it creates an
object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to target.
Apple's GCC on Darwin does create "fat" files if multiple '-arch'
options are used; it does so by running the compiler or linker multiple
times and joining the results together with 'lipo'.

 The subtype of the file created (like 'ppc7400' or 'ppc970' or 'i686')
is determined by the flags that specify the ISA that GCC is targeting,
like '-mcpu' or '-march'.  The '-force_cpusubtype_ALL' option can be
used to override this.

 The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
mismatch.  The assembler, 'as', only permits instructions to be used
that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating, so you
cannot put 64-bit instructions in a 'ppc750' object file.  The linker
for shared libraries, '/usr/bin/libtool', fails and prints an error if
asked to create a shared library with a less restrictive subtype than
its input files (for instance, trying to put a 'ppc970' object file in a
'ppc7400' library).  The linker for executables, 'ld', quietly gives the
executable the most restrictive subtype of any of its input files.

'-FDIR'
     Add the framework directory DIR to the head of the list of
     directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
     interleaved with those specified by '-I' options and are scanned in
     a left-to-right order.

     A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
     framework is a directory with a 'Headers' and/or 'PrivateHeaders'
     directory contained directly in it that ends in '.framework'.  The
     name of a framework is the name of this directory excluding the
     '.framework'.  Headers associated with the framework are found in
     one of those two directories, with 'Headers' being searched first.
     A subframework is a framework directory that is in a framework's
     'Frameworks' directory.  Includes of subframework headers can only
     appear in a header of a framework that contains the subframework,
     or in a sibling subframework header.  Two subframeworks are
     siblings if they occur in the same framework.  A subframework
     should not have the same name as a framework; a warning is issued
     if this is violated.  Currently a subframework cannot have
     subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism may be extended to
     support this.  The standard frameworks can be found in
     '/System/Library/Frameworks' and '/Library/Frameworks'.  An example
     include looks like '#include <Framework/header.h>', where
     'Framework' denotes the name of the framework and 'header.h' is
     found in the 'PrivateHeaders' or 'Headers' directory.

'-iframeworkDIR'
     Like '-F' except the directory is a treated as a system directory.
     The main difference between this '-iframework' and '-F' is that
     with '-iframework' the compiler does not warn about constructs
     contained within header files found via DIR.  This option is valid
     only for the C family of languages.

'-gused'
     Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
     debugging format, this enables '-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols'.
     This is by default ON.

'-gfull'
     Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.

'-mmacosx-version-min=VERSION'
     The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on is
     VERSION.  Typical values of VERSION include '10.1', '10.2', and
     '10.3.9'.

     If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
     then the default for this option is the system version on which the
     compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
     are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.

'-mkernel'
     Enable kernel development mode.  The '-mkernel' option sets
     '-static', '-fno-common', '-fno-use-cxa-atexit', '-fno-exceptions',
     '-fno-non-call-exceptions', '-fapple-kext', '-fno-weak' and
     '-fno-rtti' where applicable.  This mode also sets '-mno-altivec',
     '-msoft-float', '-fno-builtin' and '-mlong-branch' for PowerPC
     targets.

'-mone-byte-bool'
     Override the defaults for 'bool' so that 'sizeof(bool)==1'.  By
     default 'sizeof(bool)' is '4' when compiling for Darwin/PowerPC and
     '1' when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option has no effect on
     x86.

     *Warning:* The '-mone-byte-bool' switch causes GCC to generate code
     that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
     switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all other
     modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this switch
     to conform to a non-default data model.

'-mfix-and-continue'
'-ffix-and-continue'
'-findirect-data'
     Generate code suitable for fast turnaround development, such as to
     allow GDB to dynamically load '.o' files into already-running
     programs.  '-findirect-data' and '-ffix-and-continue' are provided
     for backwards compatibility.

'-all_load'
     Loads all members of static archive libraries.  See man ld(1) for
     more information.

'-arch_errors_fatal'
     Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong
     architecture to be fatal.

'-bind_at_load'
     Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic linker
     will bind all undefined references when the file is loaded or
     launched.

'-bundle'
     Produce a Mach-o bundle format file.  See man ld(1) for more
     information.

'-bundle_loader EXECUTABLE'
     This option specifies the EXECUTABLE that will load the build
     output file being linked.  See man ld(1) for more information.

'-dynamiclib'
     When passed this option, GCC produces a dynamic library instead of
     an executable when linking, using the Darwin 'libtool' command.

'-force_cpusubtype_ALL'
     This causes GCC's output file to have the ALL subtype, instead of
     one controlled by the '-mcpu' or '-march' option.

'-allowable_client CLIENT_NAME'
'-client_name'
'-compatibility_version'

File: gcc.info,  Node: DEC Alpha Options,  Next: FR30 Options,  Prev: Darwin Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.11 DEC Alpha Options
-------------------------

These '-m' options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

'-mno-soft-float'
'-msoft-float'
     Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
     floating-point operations.  When '-msoft-float' is specified,
     functions in 'libgcc.a' are used to perform floating-point
     operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
     floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call
     such emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
     operations.  If you are compiling for an Alpha without
     floating-point operations, you must ensure that the library is
     built so as not to call them.

     Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations
     are required to have floating-point registers.

'-mfp-reg'
'-mno-fp-regs'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register
     set.  '-mno-fp-regs' implies '-msoft-float'.  If the floating-point
     register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in
     integer registers as if they were integers and floating-point
     results are passed in '$0' instead of '$f0'.  This is a
     non-standard calling sequence, so any function with a
     floating-point argument or return value called by code compiled
     with '-mno-fp-regs' must also be compiled with that option.

     A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not
     use, and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point
     registers.

'-mieee'
     The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized
     for maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE
     floating-point standard.  However, for full compliance, software
     assistance is required.  This option generates code fully
     IEEE-compliant code _except_ that the INEXACT-FLAG is not
     maintained (see below).  If this option is turned on, the
     preprocessor macro '_IEEE_FP' is defined during compilation.  The
     resulting code is less efficient but is able to correctly support
     denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE values such as
     not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha compilers call
     this option '-ieee_with_no_inexact'.

'-mieee-with-inexact'
     This is like '-mieee' except the generated code also maintains the
     IEEE INEXACT-FLAG.  Turning on this option causes the generated
     code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to
     '_IEEE_FP', '_IEEE_FP_EXACT' is defined as a preprocessor macro.
     On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
     significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since
     there is very little code that depends on the INEXACT-FLAG, you
     should normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers
     call this option '-ieee_with_inexact'.

'-mfp-trap-mode=TRAP-MODE'
     This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
     Other Alpha compilers call this option '-fptm TRAP-MODE'.  The trap
     mode can be set to one of four values:

     'n'
          This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are
          enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in software
          (e.g., division by zero trap).

     'u'
          In addition to the traps enabled by 'n', underflow traps are
          enabled as well.

     'su'
          Like 'u', but the instructions are marked to be safe for
          software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for
          details).

     'sui'
          Like 'su', but inexact traps are enabled as well.

'-mfp-rounding-mode=ROUNDING-MODE'
     Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this
     option '-fprm ROUNDING-MODE'.  The ROUNDING-MODE can be one of:

     'n'
          Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded
          towards the nearest machine number or towards the even machine
          number in case of a tie.

     'm'
          Round towards minus infinity.

     'c'
          Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded
          towards zero.

     'd'
          Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control
          register (FPCR, see Alpha architecture reference manual)
          controls the rounding mode in effect.  The C library
          initializes this register for rounding towards plus infinity.
          Thus, unless your program modifies the FPCR, 'd' corresponds
          to round towards plus infinity.

'-mtrap-precision=TRAP-PRECISION'
     In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.
     This means without software assistance it is impossible to recover
     from a floating trap and program execution normally needs to be
     terminated.  GCC can generate code that can assist operating system
     trap handlers in determining the exact location that caused a
     floating-point trap.  Depending on the requirements of an
     application, different levels of precisions can be selected:

     'p'
          Program precision.  This option is the default and means a
          trap handler can only identify which program caused a
          floating-point exception.

     'f'
          Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the
          function that caused a floating-point exception.

     'i'
          Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the
          exact instruction that caused a floating-point exception.

     Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
     '-scope_safe' and '-resumption_safe'.

'-mieee-conformant'
     This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must
     not use this option unless you also specify '-mtrap-precision=i'
     and either '-mfp-trap-mode=su' or '-mfp-trap-mode=sui'.  Its only
     effect is to emit the line '.eflag 48' in the function prologue of
     the generated assembly file.

'-mbuild-constants'
     Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to see if it
     can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
     instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal
     and generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.

     Use this option to require GCC to construct _all_ integer constants
     using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is
     six).

     You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
     loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
     before it can find the variables and constants in its own data
     segment.

'-mbwx'
'-mno-bwx'
'-mcix'
'-mno-cix'
'-mfix'
'-mno-fix'
'-mmax'
'-mno-max'
     Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
     CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the
     instruction sets supported by the CPU type specified via '-mcpu='
     option or that of the CPU on which GCC was built if none is
     specified.

'-mfloat-vax'
'-mfloat-ieee'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating-point
     arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.

'-mexplicit-relocs'
'-mno-explicit-relocs'
     Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol
     relocations except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does
     not allow optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of
     version 2.12 supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to
     explicitly mark which relocations should apply to which
     instructions.  This option is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC
     detects the capabilities of the assembler when it is built and sets
     the default accordingly.

'-msmall-data'
'-mlarge-data'
     When '-mexplicit-relocs' is in effect, static data is accessed via
     "gp-relative" relocations.  When '-msmall-data' is used, objects 8
     bytes long or smaller are placed in a "small data area" (the
     '.sdata' and '.sbss' sections) and are accessed via 16-bit
     relocations off of the '$gp' register.  This limits the size of the
     small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be directly
     accessed via a single instruction.

     The default is '-mlarge-data'.  With this option the data area is
     limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
     data must use 'malloc' or 'mmap' to allocate the data in the heap
     instead of in the program's data segment.

     When generating code for shared libraries, '-fpic' implies
     '-msmall-data' and '-fPIC' implies '-mlarge-data'.

'-msmall-text'
'-mlarge-text'
     When '-msmall-text' is used, the compiler assumes that the code of
     the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is thus
     reachable with a branch instruction.  When '-msmall-data' is used,
     the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the same '$gp'
     value, and thus reduce the number of instructions required for a
     function call from 4 to 1.

     The default is '-mlarge-text'.

'-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
     machine type CPU_TYPE.  You can specify either the 'EV' style name
     or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports scheduling
     parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6 family of processors and
     chooses the default values for the instruction set from the
     processor you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, GCC
     defaults to the processor on which the compiler was built.

     Supported values for CPU_TYPE are

     'ev4'
     'ev45'
     '21064'
          Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set extensions.

     'ev5'
     '21164'
          Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set extensions.

     'ev56'
     '21164a'
          Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.

     'pca56'
     '21164pc'
     '21164PC'
          Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX extensions.

     'ev6'
     '21264'
          Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX, and MAX
          extensions.

     'ev67'
     '21264a'
          Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, CIX, FIX, and MAX
          extensions.

     Native toolchains also support the value 'native', which selects
     the best architecture option for the host processor.
     '-mcpu=native' has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
     processor.

'-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
     Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
     CPU_TYPE.  The instruction set is not changed.

     Native toolchains also support the value 'native', which selects
     the best architecture option for the host processor.
     '-mtune=native' has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
     processor.

'-mmemory-latency=TIME'
     Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory
     references as seen by the application.  This number is highly
     dependent on the memory access patterns used by the application and
     the size of the external cache on the machine.

     Valid options for TIME are

     'NUMBER'
          A decimal number representing clock cycles.

     'L1'
     'L2'
     'L3'
     'main'
          The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock cycles
          for "typical" EV4 & EV5 hardware for the Level 1, 2 & 3 caches
          (also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as well as to main
          memory.  Note that L3 is only valid for EV5.

3.17.12 FR30 Options
--------------------

These options are defined specifically for the FR30 port.

'-msmall-model'
     Use the small address space model.  This can produce smaller code,
     but it does assume that all symbolic values and addresses fit into
     a 20-bit range.

'-mno-lsim'
     Assume that runtime support has been provided and so there is no
     need to include the simulator library ('libsim.a') on the linker
     command line.


File: gcc.info,  Node: FRV Options,  Next: GNU/Linux Options,  Prev: FR30 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.13 FRV Options
-------------------

'-mgpr-32'

     Only use the first 32 general-purpose registers.

'-mgpr-64'

     Use all 64 general-purpose registers.

'-mfpr-32'

     Use only the first 32 floating-point registers.

'-mfpr-64'

     Use all 64 floating-point registers.

'-mhard-float'

     Use hardware instructions for floating-point operations.

'-msoft-float'

     Use library routines for floating-point operations.

'-malloc-cc'

     Dynamically allocate condition code registers.

'-mfixed-cc'

     Do not try to dynamically allocate condition code registers, only
     use 'icc0' and 'fcc0'.

'-mdword'

     Change ABI to use double word insns.

'-mno-dword'

     Do not use double word instructions.

'-mdouble'

     Use floating-point double instructions.

'-mno-double'

     Do not use floating-point double instructions.

'-mmedia'

     Use media instructions.

'-mno-media'

     Do not use media instructions.

'-mmuladd'

     Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

'-mno-muladd'

     Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

'-mfdpic'

     Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses function descriptors to represent
     pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related options, it
     implies '-fPIE'.  With '-fpic' or '-fpie', it assumes GOT entries
     and small data are within a 12-bit range from the GOT base address;
     with '-fPIC' or '-fPIE', GOT offsets are computed with 32 bits.
     With a 'bfin-elf' target, this option implies '-msim'.

'-minline-plt'

     Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that
     are not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without '-mfdpic'.
     It's enabled by default if optimizing for speed and compiling for
     shared libraries (i.e., '-fPIC' or '-fpic'), or when an
     optimization option such as '-O3' or above is present in the
     command line.

'-mTLS'

     Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.

'-mtls'

     Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local
     code.

'-mgprel-ro'

     Enable the use of 'GPREL' relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data
     that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by
     default, except for '-fpic' or '-fpie': even though it may help
     make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for
     4.  With '-fPIC' or '-fPIE', it trades 3 instructions for 4, one of
     which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need for
     a GOT entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a
     win.  If it is not, '-mno-gprel-ro' can be used to disable it.

'-multilib-library-pic'

     Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries.  It's implied by
     '-mlibrary-pic', as well as by '-fPIC' and '-fpic' without
     '-mfdpic'.  You should never have to use it explicitly.

'-mlinked-fp'

     Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame pointer
     whenever a stack frame is allocated.  This option is enabled by
     default and can be disabled with '-mno-linked-fp'.

'-mlong-calls'

     Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the current
     compilation unit.  This allows the functions to be placed anywhere
     within the 32-bit address space.

'-malign-labels'

     Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting NOPs into
     the previous packet.  This option only has an effect when VLIW
     packing is enabled.  It doesn't create new packets; it merely adds
     NOPs to existing ones.

'-mlibrary-pic'

     Generate position-independent EABI code.

'-macc-4'

     Use only the first four media accumulator registers.

'-macc-8'

     Use all eight media accumulator registers.

'-mpack'

     Pack VLIW instructions.

'-mno-pack'

     Do not pack VLIW instructions.

'-mno-eflags'

     Do not mark ABI switches in e_flags.

'-mcond-move'

     Enable the use of conditional-move instructions (default).

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mno-cond-move'

     Disable the use of conditional-move instructions.

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mscc'

     Enable the use of conditional set instructions (default).

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mno-scc'

     Disable the use of conditional set instructions.

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mcond-exec'

     Enable the use of conditional execution (default).

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mno-cond-exec'

     Disable the use of conditional execution.

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mvliw-branch'

     Run a pass to pack branches into VLIW instructions (default).

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mno-vliw-branch'

     Do not run a pass to pack branches into VLIW instructions.

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mmulti-cond-exec'

     Enable optimization of '&&' and '||' in conditional execution
     (default).

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mno-multi-cond-exec'

     Disable optimization of '&&' and '||' in conditional execution.

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mnested-cond-exec'

     Enable nested conditional execution optimizations (default).

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-mno-nested-cond-exec'

     Disable nested conditional execution optimizations.

     This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will likely be
     removed in a future version.

'-moptimize-membar'

     This switch removes redundant 'membar' instructions from the
     compiler-generated code.  It is enabled by default.

'-mno-optimize-membar'

     This switch disables the automatic removal of redundant 'membar'
     instructions from the generated code.

'-mtomcat-stats'

     Cause gas to print out tomcat statistics.

'-mcpu=CPU'

     Select the processor type for which to generate code.  Possible
     values are 'frv', 'fr550', 'tomcat', 'fr500', 'fr450', 'fr405',
     'fr400', 'fr300' and 'simple'.

3.17.14 GNU/Linux Options
-------------------------

These '-m' options are defined for GNU/Linux targets:

'-mglibc'
     Use the GNU C library.  This is the default except on
     '*-*-linux-*uclibc*' and '*-*-linux-*android*' targets.

'-muclibc'
     Use uClibc C library.  This is the default on '*-*-linux-*uclibc*'
     targets.

'-mbionic'
     Use Bionic C library.  This is the default on '*-*-linux-*android*'
     targets.

'-mandroid'
     Compile code compatible with Android platform.  This is the default
     on '*-*-linux-*android*' targets.

     When compiling, this option enables '-mbionic', '-fPIC',
     '-fno-exceptions' and '-fno-rtti' by default.  When linking, this
     option makes the GCC driver pass Android-specific options to the
     linker.  Finally, this option causes the preprocessor macro
     '__ANDROID__' to be defined.

'-tno-android-cc'
     Disable compilation effects of '-mandroid', i.e., do not enable
     '-mbionic', '-fPIC', '-fno-exceptions' and '-fno-rtti' by default.

'-tno-android-ld'
     Disable linking effects of '-mandroid', i.e., pass standard Linux
     linking options to the linker.


File: gcc.info,  Node: H8/300 Options,  Next: HPPA Options,  Prev: GNU/Linux Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.15 H8/300 Options
----------------------

These '-m' options are defined for the H8/300 implementations:

'-mrelax'
     Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses
     the linker option '-relax'.  *Note 'ld' and the H8/300: (ld)H8/300,
     for a fuller description.

'-mh'
     Generate code for the H8/300H.

'-ms'
     Generate code for the H8S.

'-mn'
     Generate code for the H8S and H8/300H in the normal mode.  This
     switch must be used either with '-mh' or '-ms'.

'-ms2600'
     Generate code for the H8S/2600.  This switch must be used with
     '-ms'.

'-mexr'
     Extended registers are stored on stack before execution of function
     with monitor attribute.  Default option is '-mexr'.  This option is
     valid only for H8S targets.

'-mno-exr'
     Extended registers are not stored on stack before execution of
     function with monitor attribute.  Default option is '-mno-exr'.
     This option is valid only for H8S targets.

'-mint32'
     Make 'int' data 32 bits by default.

'-malign-300'
     On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for the
     H8/300.  The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align longs and
     floats on 4-byte boundaries.  '-malign-300' causes them to be
     aligned on 2-byte boundaries.  This option has no effect on the
     H8/300.

3.17.16 HPPA Options
--------------------

These '-m' options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

'-march=ARCHITECTURE-TYPE'
     Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
     ARCHITECTURE-TYPE are '1.0' for PA 1.0, '1.1' for PA 1.1, and '2.0'
     for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to '/usr/lib/sched.models' on an
     HP-UX system to determine the proper architecture option for your
     machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered architectures runs on
     higher numbered architectures, but not the other way around.

'-mpa-risc-1-0'
'-mpa-risc-1-1'
'-mpa-risc-2-0'
     Synonyms for '-march=1.0', '-march=1.1', and '-march=2.0'
     respectively.

'-mjump-in-delay'
     Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump
     instructions by modifying the return pointer for the function call
     to be the target of the conditional jump.

'-mdisable-fpregs'
     Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.
     This is necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context
     switching of floating-point registers.  If you use this option and
     attempt to perform floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.

'-mdisable-indexing'
     Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This
     avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated
     code under MACH.

'-mno-space-regs'
     Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This
     allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index
     address modes.

     Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

'-mfast-indirect-calls'
     Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.
     This allows GCC to emit code that performs faster indirect calls.

     This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or
     nested functions.

'-mfixed-range=REGISTER-RANGE'
     Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
     A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
     specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register
     ranges can be specified separated by a comma.

'-mlong-load-store'
     Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes
     required by the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the '+k'
     option to the HP compilers.

'-mportable-runtime'
     Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
     systems.

'-mgas'
     Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

'-mschedule=CPU-TYPE'
     Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
     CPU-TYPE.  The choices for CPU-TYPE are '700' '7100', '7100LC',
     '7200', '7300' and '8000'.  Refer to '/usr/lib/sched.models' on an
     HP-UX system to determine the proper scheduling option for your
     machine.  The default scheduling is '8000'.

'-mlinker-opt'
     Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes
     symbolic debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX
     8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they give bogus error messages when
     linking some programs.

'-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler
     are used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.
     You must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.

     '-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile _all_ of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile 'libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GCC, with '-msoft-float' in order for this
     to work.

'-msio'
     Generate the predefine, '_SIO', for server IO.  The default is
     '-mwsio'.  This generates the predefines, '__hp9000s700',
     '__hp9000s700__' and '_WSIO', for workstation IO.  These options
     are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

'-mgnu-ld'
     Use options specific to GNU 'ld'.  This passes '-shared' to 'ld'
     when building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is
     configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This
     option does not affect which 'ld' is called; it only changes what
     parameters are passed to that 'ld'.  The 'ld' that is called is
     determined by the '--with-ld' configure option, GCC's program
     search path, and finally by the user's 'PATH'.  The linker used by
     GCC can be printed using 'which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`'.  This
     option is only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured
     with 'hppa*64*-*-hpux*'.

'-mhp-ld'
     Use options specific to HP 'ld'.  This passes '-b' to 'ld' when
     building a shared library and passes '+Accept TypeMismatch' to 'ld'
     on all links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly
     or implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not affect
     which 'ld' is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to
     that 'ld'.  The 'ld' that is called is determined by the
     '--with-ld' configure option, GCC's program search path, and
     finally by the user's 'PATH'.  The linker used by GCC can be
     printed using 'which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`'.  This option is
     only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
     'hppa*64*-*-hpux*'.

'-mlong-calls'
     Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a
     call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default
     is to generate long calls only when the distance from the call site
     to the beginning of the function or translation unit, as the case
     may be, exceeds a predefined limit set by the branch type being
     used.  The limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes,
     respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are
     always limited at 240,000 bytes.

     Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using
     the '-ffunction-sections' option, or when using the '-mgas' and
     '-mno-portable-runtime' options together under HP-UX with the SOM
     linker.

     It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
     performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
     particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

     The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
     assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
     impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
     symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
     However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
     and it is quite long.

'-munix=UNIX-STD'
     Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the
     specified UNIX standard.  The choices for UNIX-STD are '93', '95'
     and '98'.  '93' is supported on all HP-UX versions.  '95' is
     available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  '98' is available on HP-UX
     11.11 and later.  The default values are '93' for HP-UX 10.00, '95'
     for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and '98' for HP-UX 11.11 and
     later.

     '-munix=93' provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4.
     '-munix=95' provides additional predefines for 'XOPEN_UNIX' and
     '_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED', and the startfile 'unix95.o'.
     '-munix=98' provides additional predefines for '_XOPEN_UNIX',
     '_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED', '_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE' and
     '_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500', and the startfile 'unix98.o'.

     It is _important_ to note that this option changes the interfaces
     for various library routines.  It also affects the operational
     behavior of the C library.  Thus, _extreme_ care is needed in using
     this option.

     Library code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX
     standard must test, set and restore the variable
     __XPG4_EXTENDED_MASK as appropriate.  Most GNU software doesn't
     provide this capability.

'-nolibdld'
     Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when
     the '-static' option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.

'-static'
     The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
     libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
     when the '-static' option is specified, special link options are
     needed to resolve this dependency.

     On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
     link with libdld.sl when the '-static' option is specified.  This
     causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port, the
     linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
     '-nolibdld' option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
     adding these link options.

'-threads'
     Add support for multithreading with the "dce thread" library under
     HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
     linker.

3.17.17 Intel 386 and AMD x86-64 Options
----------------------------------------

These '-m' options are defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of
computers:

'-march=CPU-TYPE'
     Generate instructions for the machine type CPU-TYPE.  In contrast
     to '-mtune=CPU-TYPE', which merely tunes the generated code for the
     specified CPU-TYPE, '-march=CPU-TYPE' allows GCC to generate code
     that may not run at all on processors other than the one indicated.
     Specifying '-march=CPU-TYPE' implies '-mtune=CPU-TYPE'.

     The choices for CPU-TYPE are:

     'native'
          This selects the CPU to generate code for at compilation time
          by determining the processor type of the compiling machine.
          Using '-march=native' enables all instruction subsets
          supported by the local machine (hence the result might not run
          on different machines).  Using '-mtune=native' produces code
          optimized for the local machine under the constraints of the
          selected instruction set.

     'geode'
          AMD Geode embedded processor with MMX and 3DNow! instruction
          set support.

'-mtune=CPU-TYPE'
     Tune to CPU-TYPE everything applicable about the generated code,
     except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  While
     picking a specific CPU-TYPE schedules things appropriately for that
     particular chip, the compiler does not generate any code that
     cannot run on the default machine type unless you use a
     '-march=CPU-TYPE' option.  For example, if GCC is configured for
     i686-pc-linux-gnu then '-mtune=pentium4' generates code that is
     tuned for Pentium 4 but still runs on i686 machines.

     The choices for CPU-TYPE are the same as for '-march'.  In
     addition, '-mtune' supports 2 extra choices for CPU-TYPE:

     'generic'
          Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T
          processors.  If you know the CPU on which your code will run,
          then you should use the corresponding '-mtune' or '-march'
          option instead of '-mtune=generic'.  But, if you do not know
          exactly what CPU users of your application will have, then you
          should use this option.

          As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the
          behavior of this option will change.  Therefore, if you
          upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation controlled
          by this option will change to reflect the processors that are
          most common at the time that version of GCC is released.

          There is no '-march=generic' option because '-march' indicates
          the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
          generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In
          contrast, '-mtune' indicates the processor (or, in this case,
          collection of processors) for which the code is optimized.

     'intel'
          Produce code optimized for the most current Intel processors,
          which are Haswell and Silvermont for this version of GCC. If
          you know the CPU on which your code will run, then you should
          use the corresponding '-mtune' or '-march' option instead of
          '-mtune=intel'.  But, if you want your application performs
          better on both Haswell and Silvermont, then you should use
          this option.

          As new Intel processors are deployed in the marketplace, the
          behavior of this option will change.  Therefore, if you
          upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation controlled
          by this option will change to reflect the most current Intel
          processors at the time that version of GCC is released.

          There is no '-march=intel' option because '-march' indicates
          the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
          common instruction set applicable to all processors.  In
          contrast, '-mtune' indicates the processor (or, in this case,
          collection of processors) for which the code is optimized.

'-mcpu=CPU-TYPE'
     A deprecated synonym for '-mtune'.

'-mfpmath=UNIT'
     Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit UNIT.  The
     choices for UNIT are:

     '387'
          Use the standard 387 floating-point coprocessor present on the
          majority of chips and emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with
          this option runs almost everywhere.  The temporary results are
          computed in 80-bit precision instead of the precision
          specified by the type, resulting in slightly different results
          compared to most of other chips.  See '-ffloat-store' for more
          detailed description.

          This is the default choice for i386 compiler.

     'sse'
          Use scalar floating-point instructions present in the SSE
          instruction set.  This instruction set is supported by Pentium
          III and newer chips, and in the AMD line by Athlon-4, Athlon
          XP and Athlon MP chips.  The earlier version of the SSE
          instruction set supports only single-precision arithmetic,
          thus the double and extended-precision arithmetic are still
          done using 387.  A later version, present only in Pentium 4
          and AMD x86-64 chips, supports double-precision arithmetic
          too.

          For the i386 compiler, you must use '-march=CPU-TYPE', '-msse'
          or '-msse2' switches to enable SSE extensions and make this
          option effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions
          are enabled by default.

          The resulting code should be considerably faster in the
          majority of cases and avoid the numerical instability problems
          of 387 code, but may break some existing code that expects
          temporaries to be 80 bits.

          This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.

     'sse,387'
     'sse+387'
     'both'
          Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This
          effectively doubles the amount of available registers, and on
          chips with separate execution units for 387 and SSE the
          execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
          still experimental, because the GCC register allocator does
          not model separate functional units well, resulting in
          unstable performance.

'-masm=DIALECT'
     Output assembly instructions using selected DIALECT.  Supported
     choices are 'intel' or 'att' (the default).  Darwin does not
     support 'intel'.

'-mieee-fp'
'-mno-ieee-fp'
     Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating-point
     comparisons.  These correctly handle the case where the result of a
     comparison is unordered.

'-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.

     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.  Normally
     the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but this
     can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
     own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
     cross-compilation.

     On machines where a function returns floating-point results in the
     80387 register stack, some floating-point opcodes may be emitted
     even if '-msoft-float' is used.

'-mno-fp-ret-in-387'
     Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

     The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
     'float' and 'double' in an FPU register, even if there is no FPU.
     The idea is that the operating system should emulate an FPU.

     The option '-mno-fp-ret-in-387' causes such values to be returned
     in ordinary CPU registers instead.

'-mno-fancy-math-387'
     Some 387 emulators do not support the 'sin', 'cos' and 'sqrt'
     instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid generating
     those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD, OpenBSD
     and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when '-march' indicates that
     the target CPU always has an FPU and so the instruction does not
     need emulation.  These instructions are not generated unless you
     also use the '-funsafe-math-optimizations' switch.

'-malign-double'
'-mno-align-double'
     Control whether GCC aligns 'double', 'long double', and 'long long'
     variables on a two-word boundary or a one-word boundary.  Aligning
     'double' variables on a two-word boundary produces code that runs
     somewhat faster on a Pentium at the expense of more memory.

     On x86-64, '-malign-double' is enabled by default.

     *Warning:* if you use the '-malign-double' switch, structures
     containing the above types are aligned differently than the
     published application binary interface specifications for the 386
     and are not binary compatible with structures in code compiled
     without that switch.

'-m96bit-long-double'
'-m128bit-long-double'
     These switches control the size of 'long double' type.  The i386
     application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits, so
     '-m96bit-long-double' is the default in 32-bit mode.

     Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer 'long double' to be
     aligned to an 8- or 16-byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
     conforming to the ABI, this is not possible.  So specifying
     '-m128bit-long-double' aligns 'long double' to a 16-byte boundary
     by padding the 'long double' with an additional 32-bit zero.

     In the x86-64 compiler, '-m128bit-long-double' is the default
     choice as its ABI specifies that 'long double' is aligned on
     16-byte boundary.

     Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision
     over the x87 standard of 80 bits for a 'long double'.

     *Warning:* if you override the default value for your target ABI,
     this changes the size of structures and arrays containing 'long
     double' variables, as well as modifying the function calling
     convention for functions taking 'long double'.  Hence they are not
     binary-compatible with code compiled without that switch.

'-mlong-double-64'
'-mlong-double-80'
'-mlong-double-128'
     These switches control the size of 'long double' type.  A size of
     64 bits makes the 'long double' type equivalent to the 'double'
     type.  This is the default for 32-bit Bionic C library.  A size of
     128 bits makes the 'long double' type equivalent to the
     '__float128' type.  This is the default for 64-bit Bionic C
     library.

     *Warning:* if you override the default value for your target ABI,
     this changes the size of structures and arrays containing 'long
     double' variables, as well as modifying the function calling
     convention for functions taking 'long double'.  Hence they are not
     binary-compatible with code compiled without that switch.

'-mlarge-data-threshold=THRESHOLD'
     When '-mcmodel=medium' is specified, data objects larger than
     THRESHOLD are placed in the large data section.  This value must be
     the same across all objects linked into the binary, and defaults to
     65535.

'-mrtd'
     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the 'ret NUM'
     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
     the arguments there.

     You can specify that an individual function is called with this
     calling sequence with the function attribute 'stdcall'.  You can
     also override the '-mrtd' option by using the function attribute
     'cdecl'.  *Note Function Attributes::.

     *Warning:* this calling convention is incompatible with the one
     normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
     libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
     take variable numbers of arguments (including 'printf'); otherwise
     incorrect code is generated for calls to those functions.

     In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
     harmlessly ignored.)

'-mregparm=NUM'
     Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
     default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
     registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a
     specific function by using the function attribute 'regparm'.  *Note
     Function Attributes::.

     *Warning:* if you use this switch, and NUM is nonzero, then you
     must build all modules with the same value, including any
     libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.

'-msseregparm'
     Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double arguments
     and return values.  You can control this behavior for a specific
     function by using the function attribute 'sseregparm'.  *Note
     Function Attributes::.

     *Warning:* if you use this switch then you must build all modules
     with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes the
     system libraries and startup modules.

'-mvect8-ret-in-mem'
     Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.  This is
     the default on Solaris 8 and 9 and VxWorks to match the ABI of the
     Sun Studio compilers until version 12.  Later compiler versions
     (starting with Studio 12 Update 1) follow the ABI used by other x86
     targets, which is the default on Solaris 10 and later.  _Only_ use
     this option if you need to remain compatible with existing code
     produced by those previous compiler versions or older versions of
     GCC.

'-mpc32'
'-mpc64'
'-mpc80'

     Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.  When
     '-mpc32' is specified, the significands of results of
     floating-point operations are rounded to 24 bits (single
     precision); '-mpc64' rounds the significands of results of
     floating-point operations to 53 bits (double precision) and
     '-mpc80' rounds the significands of results of floating-point
     operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is the
     default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in
     higher precisions are not available to the programmer without
     setting the FPU control word explicitly.

     Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the
     default 80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that
     some mathematical libraries assume that extended-precision (80-bit)
     floating-point operations are enabled by default; routines in such
     libraries could suffer significant loss of accuracy, typically
     through so-called "catastrophic cancellation", when this option is
     used to set the precision to less than extended precision.

'-mstackrealign'
     Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the '-mstackrealign'
     option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue that realigns
     the run-time stack if necessary.  This supports mixing legacy codes
     that keep 4-byte stack alignment with modern codes that keep
     16-byte stack alignment for SSE compatibility.  See also the
     attribute 'force_align_arg_pointer', applicable to individual
     functions.

'-mpreferred-stack-boundary=NUM'
     Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to NUM
     byte boundary.  If '-mpreferred-stack-boundary' is not specified,
     the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

     *Warning:* When generating code for the x86-64 architecture with
     SSE extensions disabled, '-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3' can be used
     to keep the stack boundary aligned to 8 byte boundary.  Since
     x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack alignment, this is ABI
     incompatible and intended to be used in controlled environment
     where stack space is important limitation.  This option will lead
     to wrong code when functions compiled with 16 byte stack alignment
     (such as functions from a standard library) are called with
     misaligned stack.  In this case, SSE instructions may lead to
     misaligned memory access traps.  In addition, variable arguments
     will be handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects (including
     x87 long double and __int128), leading to wrong results.  You must
     build all modules with '-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3', including
     any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup
     modules.

'-mincoming-stack-boundary=NUM'
     Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to NUM byte
     boundary.  If '-mincoming-stack-boundary' is not specified, the one
     specified by '-mpreferred-stack-boundary' is used.

     On Pentium and Pentium Pro, 'double' and 'long double' values
     should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see '-malign-double') or
     suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III,
     the Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type '__m128' may not work
     properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.

     To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack
     boundary must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on
     the stack.  Further, every function must be generated such that it
     keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a
     higher preferred stack boundary from a function compiled with a
     lower preferred stack boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It
     is recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the
     default setting.

     This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
     increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage,
     such as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to
     reduce the preferred alignment to '-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2'.

     These switches enable or disable the use of instructions in the
     MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, AVX512F, AVX512PF,
     AVX512ER, AVX512CD, SHA, AES, PCLMUL, FSGSBASE, RDRND, F16C, FMA,

     LZCNT, RTM, or 3DNow! extended instruction sets.  These extensions
     are also available as built-in functions: see *note X86 Built-in
     Functions::, for details of the functions enabled and disabled by
     these switches.

     To generate SSE/SSE2 instructions automatically from floating-point
     code (as opposed to 387 instructions), see '-mfpmath=sse'.

     GCC depresses SSEx instructions when '-mavx' is used.  Instead, it
     generates new AVX instructions or AVX equivalence for all SSEx
     instructions when needed.

     These options enable GCC to use these extended instructions in
     generated code, even without '-mfpmath=sse'.  Applications that
     perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each
     supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In
     particular, the file containing the CPU detection code should be
     compiled without these options.

'-mdump-tune-features'
     This option instructs GCC to dump the names of the x86 performance
     tuning features and default settings.  The names can be used in
     '-mtune-ctrl=FEATURE-LIST'.

'-mtune-ctrl=FEATURE-LIST'
     This option is used to do fine grain control of x86 code generation
     features.  FEATURE-LIST is a comma separated list of FEATURE names.
     See also '-mdump-tune-features'.  When specified, the FEATURE will
     be turned on if it is not preceded with '^', otherwise, it will be
     turned off.  '-mtune-ctrl=FEATURE-LIST' is intended to be used by
     GCC developers.  Using it may lead to code paths not covered by
     testing and can potentially result in compiler ICEs or runtime
     errors.

'-mno-default'
     This option instructs GCC to turn off all tunable features.  See
     also '-mtune-ctrl=FEATURE-LIST' and '-mdump-tune-features'.

'-mcld'
     This option instructs GCC to emit a 'cld' instruction in the
     prologue of functions that use string instructions.  String
     instructions depend on the DF flag to select between autoincrement
     or autodecrement mode.  While the ABI specifies the DF flag to be
     cleared on function entry, some operating systems violate this
     specification by not clearing the DF flag in their exception
     dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the DF flag
     set, which leads to wrong direction mode when string instructions
     are used.  This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86
     targets by configuring GCC with the '--enable-cld' configure
     option.  Generation of 'cld' instructions can be suppressed with
     the '-mno-cld' compiler option in this case.

'-mvzeroupper'
     This option instructs GCC to emit a 'vzeroupper' instruction before
     a transfer of control flow out of the function to minimize the AVX
     to SSE transition penalty as well as remove unnecessary 'zeroupper'
     intrinsics.

'-mprefer-avx128'
     This option instructs GCC to use 128-bit AVX instructions instead
     of 256-bit AVX instructions in the auto-vectorizer.

'-mcx16'
     This option enables GCC to generate 'CMPXCHG16B' instructions.
     'CMPXCHG16B' allows for atomic operations on 128-bit double
     quadword (or oword) data types.  This is useful for high-resolution
     counters that can be updated by multiple processors (or cores).
     This instruction is generated as part of atomic built-in functions:
     see *note __sync Builtins:: or *note __atomic Builtins:: for
     details.

'-msahf'
     This option enables generation of 'SAHF' instructions in 64-bit
     code.  Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64 support, prior to
     the introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December 2005, lacked the
     'LAHF' and 'SAHF' instructions which were supported by AMD64.
     These are load and store instructions, respectively, for certain
     status flags.  In 64-bit mode, the 'SAHF' instruction is used to
     optimize 'fmod', 'drem', and 'remainder' built-in functions; see
     *note Other Builtins:: for details.

'-mmovbe'
     This option enables use of the 'movbe' instruction to implement
     '__builtin_bswap32' and '__builtin_bswap64'.

'-mcrc32'
     This option enables built-in functions '__builtin_ia32_crc32qi',
     '__builtin_ia32_crc32hi', '__builtin_ia32_crc32si' and
     '__builtin_ia32_crc32di' to generate the 'crc32' machine
     instruction.

'-mrecip'
     This option enables use of 'RCPSS' and 'RSQRTSS' instructions (and
     their vectorized variants 'RCPPS' and 'RSQRTPS') with an additional
     Newton-Raphson step to increase precision instead of 'DIVSS' and
     'SQRTSS' (and their vectorized variants) for single-precision
     floating-point arguments.  These instructions are generated only
     when '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is enabled together with
     '-finite-math-only' and '-fno-trapping-math'.  Note that while the
     throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput of the
     non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
     decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e.  the inverse of 1.0 equals
     0.99999994).

     Note that GCC implements '1.0f/sqrtf(X)' in terms of 'RSQRTSS' (or
     'RSQRTPS') already with '-ffast-math' (or the above option
     combination), and doesn't need '-mrecip'.

     Also note that GCC emits the above sequence with additional
     Newton-Raphson step for vectorized single-float division and
     vectorized 'sqrtf(X)' already with '-ffast-math' (or the above
     option combination), and doesn't need '-mrecip'.

'-mrecip=OPT'
     This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions may be
     used.  OPT is a comma-separated list of options, which may be
     preceded by a '!' to invert the option:

     'all'
          Enable all estimate instructions.

     'default'
          Enable the default instructions, equivalent to '-mrecip'.

     'none'
          Disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to '-mno-recip'.

     'div'
          Enable the approximation for scalar division.

     'vec-div'
          Enable the approximation for vectorized division.

     'sqrt'
          Enable the approximation for scalar square root.

     'vec-sqrt'
          Enable the approximation for vectorized square root.

     So, for example, '-mrecip=all,!sqrt' enables all of the reciprocal
     approximations, except for square root.

'-mveclibabi=TYPE'
     Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an
     external library.  Supported values for TYPE are 'svml' for the
     Intel short vector math library and 'acml' for the AMD math core
     library.  To use this option, both '-ftree-vectorize' and
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations' have to be enabled, and an SVML or
     ACML ABI-compatible library must be specified at link time.

     GCC currently emits calls to 'vmldExp2', 'vmldLn2', 'vmldLog102',
     'vmldLog102', 'vmldPow2', 'vmldTanh2', 'vmldTan2', 'vmldAtan2',
     'vmldAtanh2', 'vmldCbrt2', 'vmldSinh2', 'vmldSin2', 'vmldAsinh2',
     'vmldAsin2', 'vmldCosh2', 'vmldCos2', 'vmldAcosh2', 'vmldAcos2',
     'vmlsExp4', 'vmlsLn4', 'vmlsLog104', 'vmlsLog104', 'vmlsPow4',
     'vmlsTanh4', 'vmlsTan4', 'vmlsAtan4', 'vmlsAtanh4', 'vmlsCbrt4',
     'vmlsSinh4', 'vmlsSin4', 'vmlsAsinh4', 'vmlsAsin4', 'vmlsCosh4',
     'vmlsCos4', 'vmlsAcosh4' and 'vmlsAcos4' for corresponding function
     type when '-mveclibabi=svml' is used, and '__vrd2_sin',
     '__vrd2_cos', '__vrd2_exp', '__vrd2_log', '__vrd2_log2',
     '__vrd2_log10', '__vrs4_sinf', '__vrs4_cosf', '__vrs4_expf',
     '__vrs4_logf', '__vrs4_log2f', '__vrs4_log10f' and '__vrs4_powf'
     for the corresponding function type when '-mveclibabi=acml' is
     used.

'-mabi=NAME'
     Generate code for the specified calling convention.  Permissible
     values are 'sysv' for the ABI used on GNU/Linux and other systems,
     and 'ms' for the Microsoft ABI. The default is to use the Microsoft
     ABI when targeting Microsoft Windows and the SysV ABI on all other
     systems.  You can control this behavior for a specific function by
     using the function attribute 'ms_abi'/'sysv_abi'.  *Note Function
     Attributes::.

'-mtls-dialect=TYPE'
     Generate code to access thread-local storage using the 'gnu' or
     'gnu2' conventions.  'gnu' is the conservative default; 'gnu2' is
     more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time requirements
     that cannot be satisfied on all systems.

'-mpush-args'
'-mno-push-args'
     Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is
     shorter and usually equally fast as method using SUB/MOV operations
     and is enabled by default.  In some cases disabling it may improve
     performance because of improved scheduling and reduced
     dependencies.

'-maccumulate-outgoing-args'
     If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing
     arguments is computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on
     most modern CPUs because of reduced dependencies, improved
     scheduling and reduced stack usage when the preferred stack
     boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable increase in
     code size.  This switch implies '-mno-push-args'.

'-mthreads'
     Support thread-safe exception handling on MinGW. Programs that rely
     on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code
     with the '-mthreads' option.  When compiling, '-mthreads' defines
     '-D_MT'; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
     '-lmingwthrd' which cleans up per-thread exception-handling data.

'-mno-align-stringops'
     Do not align the destination of inlined string operations.  This
     switch reduces code size and improves performance in case the
     destination is already aligned, but GCC doesn't know about it.

'-minline-all-stringops'
     By default GCC inlines string operations only when the destination
     is known to be aligned to least a 4-byte boundary.  This enables
     more inlining and increases code size, but may improve performance
     of code that depends on fast 'memcpy', 'strlen', and 'memset' for
     short lengths.

'-minline-stringops-dynamically'
     For string operations of unknown size, use run-time checks with
     inline code for small blocks and a library call for large blocks.

'-mstringop-strategy=ALG'
     Override the internal decision heuristic for the particular
     algorithm to use for inlining string operations.  The allowed
     values for ALG are:

     'rep_byte'
     'rep_4byte'
     'rep_8byte'
          Expand using i386 'rep' prefix of the specified size.

     'byte_loop'
     'loop'
     'unrolled_loop'
          Expand into an inline loop.

     'libcall'
          Always use a library call.

'-mmemcpy-strategy=STRATEGY'
     Override the internal decision heuristic to decide if
     '__builtin_memcpy' should be inlined and what inline algorithm to
     use when the expected size of the copy operation is known.
     STRATEGY is a comma-separated list of ALG:MAX_SIZE:DEST_ALIGN
     triplets.  ALG is specified in '-mstringop-strategy', MAX_SIZE
     specifies the max byte size with which inline algorithm ALG is
     allowed.  For the last triplet, the MAX_SIZE must be '-1'.  The
     MAX_SIZE of the triplets in the list must be specified in
     increasing order.  The minimal byte size for ALG is '0' for the
     first triplet and 'MAX_SIZE + 1' of the preceding range.

'-mmemset-strategy=STRATEGY'
     The option is similar to '-mmemcpy-strategy=' except that it is to
     control '__builtin_memset' expansion.

'-momit-leaf-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.
     This avoids the instructions to save, set up, and restore frame
     pointers and makes an extra register available in leaf functions.
     The option '-fomit-leaf-frame-pointer' removes the frame pointer
     for leaf functions, which might make debugging harder.

'-mtls-direct-seg-refs'
'-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs'
     Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets from
     the TLS segment register ('%gs' for 32-bit, '%fs' for 64-bit), or
     whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or not this
     is valid depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the
     segment to cover the entire TLS area.

     For systems that use the GNU C Library, the default is on.

'-msse2avx'
'-mno-sse2avx'
     Specify that the assembler should encode SSE instructions with VEX
     prefix.  The option '-mavx' turns this on by default.

'-mfentry'
'-mno-fentry'
     If profiling is active ('-pg'), put the profiling counter call
     before the prologue.  Note: On x86 architectures the attribute
     'ms_hook_prologue' isn't possible at the moment for '-mfentry' and
     '-pg'.

'-m8bit-idiv'
'-mno-8bit-idiv'
     On some processors, like Intel Atom, 8-bit unsigned integer divide
     is much faster than 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.  This option
     generates a run-time check.  If both dividend and divisor are
     within range of 0 to 255, 8-bit unsigned integer divide is used
     instead of 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.

'-mavx256-split-unaligned-load'
'-mavx256-split-unaligned-store'
     Split 32-byte AVX unaligned load and store.

'-mstack-protector-guard=GUARD'
     Generate stack protection code using canary at GUARD.  Supported
     locations are 'global' for global canary or 'tls' for per-thread
     canary in the TLS block (the default).  This option has effect only
     when '-fstack-protector' or '-fstack-protector-all' is specified.

 These '-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on x86-64
processors in 64-bit environments.

'-m32'
'-m64'
'-mx32'
'-m16'
     Generate code for a 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The
     '-m32' option sets 'int', 'long', and pointer types to 32 bits, and
     generates code that runs on any i386 system.

     The '-m64' option sets 'int' to 32 bits and 'long' and pointer
     types to 64 bits, and generates code for the x86-64 architecture.
     For Darwin only the '-m64' option also turns off the '-fno-pic' and
     '-mdynamic-no-pic' options.

     The '-mx32' option sets 'int', 'long', and pointer types to 32
     bits, and generates code for the x86-64 architecture.

     The '-m16' option is the same as '-m32', except for that it outputs
     the '.code16gcc' assembly directive at the beginning of the
     assembly output so that the binary can run in 16-bit mode.

'-mno-red-zone'
     Do not use a so-called "red zone" for x86-64 code.  The red zone is
     mandated by the x86-64 ABI; it is a 128-byte area beyond the
     location of the stack pointer that is not modified by signal or
     interrupt handlers and therefore can be used for temporary data
     without adjusting the stack pointer.  The flag '-mno-red-zone'
     disables this red zone.

'-mcmodel=small'
     Generate code for the small code model: the program and its symbols
     must be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address space.  Pointers
     are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.
     This is the default code model.

'-mcmodel=kernel'
     Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in the
     negative 2 GB of the address space.  This model has to be used for
     Linux kernel code.

'-mcmodel=medium'
     Generate code for the medium model: the program is linked in the
     lower 2 GB of the address space.  Small symbols are also placed
     there.  Symbols with sizes larger than '-mlarge-data-threshold' are
     put into large data or BSS sections and can be located above 2GB.
     Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

'-mcmodel=large'
     Generate code for the large model.  This model makes no assumptions
     about addresses and sizes of sections.

'-maddress-mode=long'
     Generate code for long address mode.  This is only supported for
     64-bit and x32 environments.  It is the default address mode for
     64-bit environments.

'-maddress-mode=short'
     Generate code for short address mode.  This is only supported for
     32-bit and x32 environments.  It is the default address mode for
     32-bit and x32 environments.

3.17.18 i386 and x86-64 Windows Options
---------------------------------------

These additional options are available for Microsoft Windows targets:

'-mconsole'
     This option specifies that a console application is to be
     generated, by instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem
     type required for console applications.  This option is available
     for Cygwin and MinGW targets and is enabled by default on those
     targets.

'-mdll'
     This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
     specifies that a DLL--a dynamic link library--is to be generated,
     enabling the selection of the required runtime startup object and
     entry point.

'-mnop-fun-dllimport'
     This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
     specifies that the 'dllimport' attribute should be ignored.

'-mthread'
     This option is available for MinGW targets.  It specifies that
     MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.

'-municode'
     This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets.  It causes the
     'UNICODE' preprocessor macro to be predefined, and chooses
     Unicode-capable runtime startup code.

'-mwin32'
     This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
     specifies that the typical Microsoft Windows predefined macros are
     to be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence the choice
     of runtime library/startup code.

'-mwindows'
     This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
     specifies that a GUI application is to be generated by instructing
     the linker to set the PE header subsystem type appropriately.

'-fno-set-stack-executable'
     This option is available for MinGW targets.  It specifies that the
     executable flag for the stack used by nested functions isn't set.
     This is necessary for binaries running in kernel mode of Microsoft
     Windows, as there the User32 API, which is used to set executable
     privileges, isn't available.

'-fwritable-relocated-rdata'
     This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets.  It
     specifies that relocated-data in read-only section is put into
     .data section.  This is a necessary for older runtimes not
     supporting modification of .rdata sections for pseudo-relocation.

'-mpe-aligned-commons'
     This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
     specifies that the GNU extension to the PE file format that permits
     the correct alignment of COMMON variables should be used when
     generating code.  It is enabled by default if GCC detects that the
     target assembler found during configuration supports the feature.

 See also under *note i386 and x86-64 Options:: for standard options.

3.17.19 IA-64 Options
---------------------

These are the '-m' options defined for the Intel IA-64 architecture.

'-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a big-endian target.  This is the default for
     HP-UX.

'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the default for
     AIX5 and GNU/Linux.

'-mgnu-as'
'-mno-gnu-as'
     Generate (or don't) code for the GNU assembler.  This is the
     default.

'-mgnu-ld'
'-mno-gnu-ld'
     Generate (or don't) code for the GNU linker.  This is the default.

'-mno-pic'
     Generate code that does not use a global pointer register.  The
     result is not position independent code, and violates the IA-64
     ABI.

'-mvolatile-asm-stop'
'-mno-volatile-asm-stop'
     Generate (or don't) a stop bit immediately before and after
     volatile asm statements.

'-mregister-names'
'-mno-register-names'
     Generate (or don't) 'in', 'loc', and 'out' register names for the
     stacked registers.  This may make assembler output more readable.

'-mno-sdata'
'-msdata'
     Disable (or enable) optimizations that use the small data section.
     This may be useful for working around optimizer bugs.

'-mconstant-gp'
     Generate code that uses a single constant global pointer value.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.

'-mauto-pic'
     Generate code that is self-relocatable.  This implies
     '-mconstant-gp'.  This is useful when compiling firmware code.

'-minline-float-divide-min-latency'
     Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values using the
     minimum latency algorithm.

'-minline-float-divide-max-throughput'
     Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values using the
     maximum throughput algorithm.

'-mno-inline-float-divide'
     Do not generate inline code for divides of floating-point values.

'-minline-int-divide-min-latency'
     Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the
     minimum latency algorithm.

'-minline-int-divide-max-throughput'
     Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the
     maximum throughput algorithm.

'-mno-inline-int-divide'
     Do not generate inline code for divides of integer values.

'-minline-sqrt-min-latency'
     Generate code for inline square roots using the minimum latency
     algorithm.

'-minline-sqrt-max-throughput'
     Generate code for inline square roots using the maximum throughput
     algorithm.

'-mno-inline-sqrt'
     Do not generate inline code for 'sqrt'.

'-mfused-madd'
'-mno-fused-madd'
     Do (don't) generate code that uses the fused multiply/add or
     multiply/subtract instructions.  The default is to use these
     instructions.

'-mno-dwarf2-asm'
'-mdwarf2-asm'
     Don't (or do) generate assembler code for the DWARF 2 line number
     debugging info.  This may be useful when not using the GNU
     assembler.

'-mearly-stop-bits'
'-mno-early-stop-bits'
     Allow stop bits to be placed earlier than immediately preceding the
     instruction that triggered the stop bit.  This can improve
     instruction scheduling, but does not always do so.

'-mfixed-range=REGISTER-RANGE'
     Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
     A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
     specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register
     ranges can be specified separated by a comma.

'-mtls-size=TLS-SIZE'
     Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are 14,
     22, and 64.

'-mtune=CPU-TYPE'
     Tune the instruction scheduling for a particular CPU, Valid values
     are 'itanium', 'itanium1', 'merced', 'itanium2', and 'mckinley'.

'-milp32'
'-mlp64'
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit
     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.
     These are HP-UX specific flags.

'-mno-sched-br-data-spec'
'-msched-br-data-spec'
     (Dis/En)able data speculative scheduling before reload.  This
     results in generation of 'ld.a' instructions and the corresponding
     check instructions ('ld.c' / 'chk.a').  The default is 'disable'.

'-msched-ar-data-spec'
'-mno-sched-ar-data-spec'
     (En/Dis)able data speculative scheduling after reload.  This
     results in generation of 'ld.a' instructions and the corresponding
     check instructions ('ld.c' / 'chk.a').  The default is 'enable'.

'-mno-sched-control-spec'
'-msched-control-spec'
     (Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling.  This feature is
     available only during region scheduling (i.e. before reload).  This
     results in generation of the 'ld.s' instructions and the
     corresponding check instructions 'chk.s'.  The default is
     'disable'.

'-msched-br-in-data-spec'
'-mno-sched-br-in-data-spec'
     (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are
     dependent on the data speculative loads before reload.  This is
     effective only with '-msched-br-data-spec' enabled.  The default is
     'enable'.

'-msched-ar-in-data-spec'
'-mno-sched-ar-in-data-spec'
     (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are
     dependent on the data speculative loads after reload.  This is
     effective only with '-msched-ar-data-spec' enabled.  The default is
     'enable'.

'-msched-in-control-spec'
'-mno-sched-in-control-spec'
     (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that are
     dependent on the control speculative loads.  This is effective only
     with '-msched-control-spec' enabled.  The default is 'enable'.

'-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns'
'-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns'
     If enabled, data-speculative instructions are chosen for schedule
     only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This makes the
     use of the data speculation much more conservative.  The default is
     'disable'.

'-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns'
'-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns'
     If enabled, control-speculative instructions are chosen for
     schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This
     makes the use of the control speculation much more conservative.
     The default is 'disable'.

'-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path'
'-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path'
     If enabled, speculative dependencies are considered during
     computation of the instructions priorities.  This makes the use of
     the speculation a bit more conservative.  The default is 'disable'.

'-msched-spec-ldc'
     Use a simple data speculation check.  This option is on by default.

'-msched-control-spec-ldc'
     Use a simple check for control speculation.  This option is on by
     default.

'-msched-stop-bits-after-every-cycle'
     Place a stop bit after every cycle when scheduling.  This option is
     on by default.

'-msched-fp-mem-deps-zero-cost'
     Assume that floating-point stores and loads are not likely to cause
     a conflict when placed into the same instruction group.  This
     option is disabled by default.

'-msel-sched-dont-check-control-spec'
     Generate checks for control speculation in selective scheduling.
     This flag is disabled by default.

'-msched-max-memory-insns=MAX-INSNS'
     Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group, giving
     lower priority to subsequent memory insns attempting to schedule in
     the same instruction group.  Frequently useful to prevent cache
     bank conflicts.  The default value is 1.

'-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit'
     Makes the limit specified by 'msched-max-memory-insns' a hard
     limit, disallowing more than that number in an instruction group.
     Otherwise, the limit is "soft", meaning that non-memory operations
     are preferred when the limit is reached, but memory operations may
     still be scheduled.

3.17.20 LM32 Options
--------------------

These '-m' options are defined for the LatticeMico32 architecture:

'-mbarrel-shift-enabled'
     Enable barrel-shift instructions.

'-mdivide-enabled'
     Enable divide and modulus instructions.

'-mmultiply-enabled'
     Enable multiply instructions.

'-msign-extend-enabled'
     Enable sign extend instructions.

'-muser-enabled'
     Enable user-defined instructions.

3.17.21 M32C Options
--------------------

'-mcpu=NAME'
     Select the CPU for which code is generated.  NAME may be one of
     'r8c' for the R8C/Tiny series, 'm16c' for the M16C (up to /60)
     series, 'm32cm' for the M16C/80 series, or 'm32c' for the M32C/80
     series.

'-msim'
     Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This
     causes an alternate runtime library to be linked in which supports,
     for example, file I/O.  You must not use this option when
     generating programs that will run on real hardware; you must
     provide your own runtime library for whatever I/O functions are
     needed.

'-memregs=NUMBER'
     Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC uses
     during code generation.  These pseudo-registers are used like real
     registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit the
     code into available registers, and the performance penalty of using
     memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a program
     must be compiled with the same value for this option.  Because of
     that, you must not use this option with GCC's default runtime
     libraries.

3.17.22 M32R/D Options
----------------------

These '-m' options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:

'-m32r2'
     Generate code for the M32R/2.

'-m32rx'
     Generate code for the M32R/X.

'-m32r'
     Generate code for the M32R.  This is the default.

'-mmodel=small'
     Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
     addresses can be loaded with the 'ld24' instruction), and assume
     all subroutines are reachable with the 'bl' instruction.  This is
     the default.

     The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
     'model' attribute.

'-mmodel=medium'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
     compiler generates 'seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume all subroutines are reachable with the 'bl'
     instruction.

'-mmodel=large'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
     compiler generates 'seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume subroutines may not be reachable with the
     'bl' instruction (the compiler generates the much slower
     'seth/add3/jl' instruction sequence).

'-msdata=none'
     Disable use of the small data area.  Variables are put into one of
     '.data', '.bss', or '.rodata' (unless the 'section' attribute has
     been specified).  This is the default.

     The small data area consists of sections '.sdata' and '.sbss'.
     Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
     'section' attribute using one of these sections.

'-msdata=sdata'
     Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
     generate special code to reference them.

'-msdata=use'
     Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
     generate special instructions to reference them.

'-G NUM'
     Put global and static objects less than or equal to NUM bytes into
     the small data or BSS sections instead of the normal data or BSS
     sections.  The default value of NUM is 8.  The '-msdata' option
     must be set to one of 'sdata' or 'use' for this option to have any
     effect.

     All modules should be compiled with the same '-G NUM' value.
     Compiling with different values of NUM may or may not work; if it
     doesn't the linker gives an error message--incorrect code is not
     generated.

'-mdebug'
     Makes the M32R-specific code in the compiler display some
     statistics that might help in debugging programs.

'-malign-loops'
     Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.

'-mno-align-loops'
     Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops.  This is the default.

'-missue-rate=NUMBER'
     Issue NUMBER instructions per cycle.  NUMBER can only be 1 or 2.

'-mbranch-cost=NUMBER'
     NUMBER can only be 1 or 2.  If it is 1 then branches are preferred
     over conditional code, if it is 2, then the opposite applies.

'-mflush-trap=NUMBER'
     Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache.  The default
     is 12.  Valid numbers are between 0 and 15 inclusive.

'-mno-flush-trap'
     Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a trap.

'-mflush-func=NAME'
     Specifies the name of the operating system function to call to
     flush the cache.  The default is __flush_cache_, but a function
     call is only used if a trap is not available.

'-mno-flush-func'
     Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the cache.


File: gcc.info,  Node: M680x0 Options,  Next: MCore Options,  Prev: M32R/D Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.23 M680x0 Options
----------------------

These are the '-m' options defined for M680x0 and ColdFire processors.
The default settings depend on which architecture was selected when the
compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common choices are
given below.

'-march=ARCH'
     Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction set
     architecture.  Permissible values of ARCH for M680x0 architectures
     are: '68000', '68010', '68020', '68030', '68040', '68060' and
     'cpu32'.  ColdFire architectures are selected according to
     Freescale's ISA classification and the permissible values are:
     'isaa', 'isaaplus', 'isab' and 'isac'.

     GCC defines a macro '__mcfARCH__' whenever it is generating code
     for a ColdFire target.  The ARCH in this macro is one of the
     '-march' arguments given above.

     When used together, '-march' and '-mtune' select code that runs on
     a family of similar processors but that is optimized for a
     particular microarchitecture.

'-mcpu=CPU'
     Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire processor.  The
     M680x0 CPUs are: '68000', '68010', '68020', '68030', '68040',
     '68060', '68302', '68332' and 'cpu32'.  The ColdFire CPUs are given
     by the table below, which also classifies the CPUs into families:

     *Family*       *'-mcpu' arguments*
     '51'           '51' '51ac' '51ag' '51cn' '51em' '51je' '51jf' '51jg'
                    '51jm' '51mm' '51qe' '51qm'
     '5206'         '5202' '5204' '5206'
     '5206e'        '5206e'
     '5208'         '5207' '5208'
     '5211a'        '5210a' '5211a'
     '5213'         '5211' '5212' '5213'
     '5216'         '5214' '5216'
     '52235'        '52230' '52231' '52232' '52233' '52234' '52235'
     '5225'         '5224' '5225'
     '52259'        '52252' '52254' '52255' '52256' '52258' '52259'
     '5235'         '5232' '5233' '5234' '5235' '523x'
     '5249'         '5249'
     '5250'         '5250'
     '5271'         '5270' '5271'
     '5272'         '5272'
     '5275'         '5274' '5275'
     '5282'         '5280' '5281' '5282' '528x'
     '53017'        '53011' '53012' '53013' '53014' '53015' '53016' '53017'
     '5307'         '5307'
     '5329'         '5327' '5328' '5329' '532x'
     '5373'         '5372' '5373' '537x'
     '5407'         '5407'
     '5475'         '5470' '5471' '5472' '5473' '5474' '5475' '547x' '5480'
                    '5481' '5482' '5483' '5484' '5485'

     '-mcpu=CPU' overrides '-march=ARCH' if ARCH is compatible with CPU.
     Other combinations of '-mcpu' and '-march' are rejected.

     GCC defines the macro '__mcf_cpu_CPU' when ColdFire target CPU is
     selected.  It also defines '__mcf_family_FAMILY', where the value
     of FAMILY is given by the table above.

'-mtune=TUNE'
     Tune the code for a particular microarchitecture within the
     constraints set by '-march' and '-mcpu'.  The M680x0
     microarchitectures are: '68000', '68010', '68020', '68030',
     '68040', '68060' and 'cpu32'.  The ColdFire microarchitectures are:
     'cfv1', 'cfv2', 'cfv3', 'cfv4' and 'cfv4e'.

     You can also use '-mtune=68020-40' for code that needs to run
     relatively well on 68020, 68030 and 68040 targets.
     '-mtune=68020-60' is similar but includes 68060 targets as well.
     These two options select the same tuning decisions as '-m68020-40'
     and '-m68020-60' respectively.

     GCC defines the macros '__mcARCH' and '__mcARCH__' when tuning for
     680x0 architecture ARCH.  It also defines 'mcARCH' unless either
     '-ansi' or a non-GNU '-std' option is used.  If GCC is tuning for a
     range of architectures, as selected by '-mtune=68020-40' or
     '-mtune=68020-60', it defines the macros for every architecture in
     the range.

     GCC also defines the macro '__mUARCH__' when tuning for ColdFire
     microarchitecture UARCH, where UARCH is one of the arguments given
     above.

'-m68000'
'-mc68000'
     Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for 68000-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=68000'.

     Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core,
     including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.

'-m68010'
     Generate output for a 68010.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for 68010-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=68010'.

'-m68020'
'-mc68020'
     Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for 68020-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=68020'.

'-m68030'
     Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for 68030-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=68030'.

'-m68040'
     Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for 68040-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=68040'.

     This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have
     to be emulated by software on the 68040.  Use this option if your
     68040 does not have code to emulate those instructions.

'-m68060'
     Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for 68060-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=68060'.

     This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882 instructions
     that have to be emulated by software on the 68060.  Use this option
     if your 68060 does not have code to emulate those instructions.

'-mcpu32'
     Generate output for a CPU32.  This is the default when the compiler
     is configured for CPU32-based systems.  It is equivalent to
     '-march=cpu32'.

     Use this option for microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+ core,
     including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334, 68336, 68340,
     68341, 68349 and 68360.

'-m5200'
     Generate output for a 520X ColdFire CPU.  This is the default when
     the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems.  It is
     equivalent to '-mcpu=5206', and is now deprecated in favor of that
     option.

     Use this option for microcontroller with a 5200 core, including the
     MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5206.

'-m5206e'
     Generate output for a 5206e ColdFire CPU.  The option is now
     deprecated in favor of the equivalent '-mcpu=5206e'.

'-m528x'
     Generate output for a member of the ColdFire 528X family.  The
     option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent '-mcpu=528x'.

'-m5307'
     Generate output for a ColdFire 5307 CPU.  The option is now
     deprecated in favor of the equivalent '-mcpu=5307'.

'-m5407'
     Generate output for a ColdFire 5407 CPU.  The option is now
     deprecated in favor of the equivalent '-mcpu=5407'.

'-mcfv4e'
     Generate output for a ColdFire V4e family CPU (e.g. 547x/548x).
     This includes use of hardware floating-point instructions.  The
     option is equivalent to '-mcpu=547x', and is now deprecated in
     favor of that option.

'-m68020-40'
     Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code that can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated on
     the 68040.

     The option is equivalent to '-march=68020' '-mtune=68020-40'.

'-m68020-60'
     Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code that can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated on
     the 68060.

     The option is equivalent to '-march=68020' '-mtune=68020-60'.

'-mhard-float'
'-m68881'
     Generate floating-point instructions.  This is the default for
     68020 and above, and for ColdFire devices that have an FPU.  It
     defines the macro '__HAVE_68881__' on M680x0 targets and
     '__mcffpu__' on ColdFire targets.

'-msoft-float'
     Do not generate floating-point instructions; use library calls
     instead.  This is the default for 68000, 68010, and 68832 targets.
     It is also the default for ColdFire devices that have no FPU.

'-mdiv'
'-mno-div'
     Generate (do not generate) ColdFire hardware divide and remainder
     instructions.  If '-march' is used without '-mcpu', the default is
     "on" for ColdFire architectures and "off" for M680x0 architectures.
     Otherwise, the default is taken from the target CPU (either the
     default CPU, or the one specified by '-mcpu').  For example, the
     default is "off" for '-mcpu=5206' and "on" for '-mcpu=5206e'.

     GCC defines the macro '__mcfhwdiv__' when this option is enabled.

'-mshort'
     Consider type 'int' to be 16 bits wide, like 'short int'.
     Additionally, parameters passed on the stack are also aligned to a
     16-bit boundary even on targets whose API mandates promotion to
     32-bit.

'-mno-short'
     Do not consider type 'int' to be 16 bits wide.  This is the
     default.

'-mnobitfield'
'-mno-bitfield'
     Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The '-m68000', '-mcpu32'
     and '-m5200' options imply '-mnobitfield'.

'-mbitfield'
     Do use the bit-field instructions.  The '-m68020' option implies
     '-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use a configuration
     designed for a 68020.

'-mrtd'
     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the 'rtd'
     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
     the arguments there.

     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
     compiled with the Unix compiler.

     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
     take variable numbers of arguments (including 'printf'); otherwise
     incorrect code is generated for calls to those functions.

     In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
     harmlessly ignored.)

     The 'rtd' instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
     68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.

'-mno-rtd'
     Do not use the calling conventions selected by '-mrtd'.  This is
     the default.

'-malign-int'
'-mno-align-int'
     Control whether GCC aligns 'int', 'long', 'long long', 'float',
     'double', and 'long double' variables on a 32-bit boundary
     ('-malign-int') or a 16-bit boundary ('-mno-align-int').  Aligning
     variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
     faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more
     memory.

     *Warning:* if you use the '-malign-int' switch, GCC aligns
     structures containing the above types differently than most
     published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.

'-mpcrel'
     Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead
     of using a global offset table.  At present, this option implies
     '-fpic', allowing at most a 16-bit offset for pc-relative
     addressing.  '-fPIC' is not presently supported with '-mpcrel',
     though this could be supported for 68020 and higher processors.

'-mno-strict-align'
'-mstrict-align'
     Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references are handled by
     the system.

'-msep-data'
     Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a
     different area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for
     execute-in-place in an environment without virtual memory
     management.  This option implies '-fPIC'.

'-mno-sep-data'
     Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text
     segment.  This is the default.

'-mid-shared-library'
     Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID
     method.  This allows for execute-in-place and shared libraries in
     an environment without virtual memory management.  This option
     implies '-fPIC'.

'-mno-id-shared-library'
     Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are
     being used.  This is the default.

'-mshared-library-id=n'
     Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library
     being compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact
     code; specifying other values forces the allocation of that number
     to the current library, but is no more space- or time-efficient
     than omitting this option.

'-mxgot'
'-mno-xgot'
     When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate
     code that works if the GOT has more than 8192 entries.  This code
     is larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On
     M680x0 processors, this option is not needed; '-fPIC' suffices.

     GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT.
     While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is
     smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker to
     report an error such as:

          relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar

     If this happens, you should recompile your code with '-mxgot'.  It
     should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated
     with '-mxgot' is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to
     fetch the value of a global symbol.

     Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU linker,
     can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries.  If you have such a
     linker, you should only need to use '-mxgot' when compiling a
     single object file that accesses more than 8192 GOT entries.  Very
     few do.

     These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
     position-independent code.

'-mno-div'
     Use the divide instruction.  (Enabled by default).

'-mrelax-immediate'
'-mno-relax-immediate'
     Allow arbitrary-sized immediates in bit operations.

'-mwide-bitfields'
'-mno-wide-bitfields'
     Always treat bit-fields as 'int'-sized.

'-m4byte-functions'
'-mno-4byte-functions'
     Force all functions to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary.

     Assume that runtime support has been provided and so omit the
     simulator library ('libsim.a)' from the linker command line.

'-mstack-increment=SIZE'
     Set the maximum amount for a single stack increment operation.
     Large values can increase the speed of programs that contain
     functions that need a large amount of stack space, but they can
     also trigger a segmentation fault if the stack is extended too
     much.  The default value is 0x1000.


File: gcc.info,  Node: MeP Options,  Next: MicroBlaze Options,  Prev: MCore Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.25 MeP Options
-------------------

'-mabsdiff'
     Enables the 'abs' instruction, which is the absolute difference
     between two registers.

'-mall-opts'
     Enables all the optional instructions--average, multiply, divide,
     bit operations, leading zero, absolute difference, min/max, clip,
     and saturation.

'-maverage'
     Enables the 'ave' instruction, which computes the average of two
     registers.

'-mbased=N'
     Variables of size N bytes or smaller are placed in the '.based'
     section by default.  Based variables use the '$tp' register as a
     base register, and there is a 128-byte limit to the '.based'
     section.

'-mbitops'
     Enables the bit operation instructions--bit test ('btstm'), set
     ('bsetm'), clear ('bclrm'), invert ('bnotm'), and test-and-set
     ('tas').

'-mc=NAME'
     Selects which section constant data is placed in.  NAME may be
     'tiny', 'near', or 'far'.

'-mclip'
     Enables the 'clip' instruction.  Note that '-mclip' is not useful
     unless you also provide '-mminmax'.

'-mconfig=NAME'
     Selects one of the built-in core configurations.  Each MeP chip has
     one or more modules in it; each module has a core CPU and a variety
     of coprocessors, optional instructions, and peripherals.  The
     'MeP-Integrator' tool, not part of GCC, provides these
     configurations through this option; using this option is the same
     as using all the corresponding command-line options.  The default
     configuration is 'default'.

'-mcop'
     Enables the coprocessor instructions.  By default, this is a 32-bit
     coprocessor.  Note that the coprocessor is normally enabled via the
     '-mconfig=' option.

'-mcop32'
     Enables the 32-bit coprocessor's instructions.

'-mcop64'
     Enables the 64-bit coprocessor's instructions.

'-mivc2'
     Enables IVC2 scheduling.  IVC2 is a 64-bit VLIW coprocessor.

'-mdc'
     Causes constant variables to be placed in the '.near' section.

'-mdiv'
     Enables the 'div' and 'divu' instructions.

'-meb'
     Generate big-endian code.

'-mel'
     Generate little-endian code.

'-mio-volatile'
     Tells the compiler that any variable marked with the 'io' attribute
     is to be considered volatile.

'-ml'
     Causes variables to be assigned to the '.far' section by default.

'-mleadz'
     Enables the 'leadz' (leading zero) instruction.

'-mm'
     Causes variables to be assigned to the '.near' section by default.

'-mminmax'
     Enables the 'min' and 'max' instructions.

'-mmult'
     Enables the multiplication and multiply-accumulate instructions.

'-mno-opts'
     Disables all the optional instructions enabled by '-mall-opts'.

'-mrepeat'
     Enables the 'repeat' and 'erepeat' instructions, used for
     low-overhead looping.

'-ms'
     Causes all variables to default to the '.tiny' section.  Note that
     there is a 65536-byte limit to this section.  Accesses to these
     variables use the '%gp' base register.

'-msatur'
     Enables the saturation instructions.  Note that the compiler does
     not currently generate these itself, but this option is included
     for compatibility with other tools, like 'as'.

'-msdram'
     Link the SDRAM-based runtime instead of the default ROM-based
     runtime.

'-msim'
     Link the simulator run-time libraries.

'-msimnovec'
     Link the simulator runtime libraries, excluding built-in support
     for reset and exception vectors and tables.

'-mtf'
     Causes all functions to default to the '.far' section.  Without
     this option, functions default to the '.near' section.

'-mtiny=N'
     Variables that are N bytes or smaller are allocated to the '.tiny'
     section.  These variables use the '$gp' base register.  The default
     for this option is 4, but note that there's a 65536-byte limit to
     the '.tiny' section.


File: gcc.info,  Node: MicroBlaze Options,  Next: MIPS Options,  Prev: MeP Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.26 MicroBlaze Options
--------------------------

'-msoft-float'
     Use software emulation for floating point (default).

'-mhard-float'
     Use hardware floating-point instructions.

'-mmemcpy'
     Do not optimize block moves, use 'memcpy'.

'-mno-clearbss'
     This option is deprecated.  Use '-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss'
     instead.

'-mcpu=CPU-TYPE'
     Use features of, and schedule code for, the given CPU. Supported
     values are in the format 'vX.YY.Z', where X is a major version, YY
     is the minor version, and Z is compatibility code.  Example values
     are 'v3.00.a', 'v4.00.b', 'v5.00.a', 'v5.00.b', 'v5.00.b',
     'v6.00.a'.

'-mxl-soft-mul'
     Use software multiply emulation (default).

'-mxl-soft-div'
     Use software emulation for divides (default).

'-mxl-barrel-shift'
     Use the hardware barrel shifter.

'-mxl-pattern-compare'
     Use pattern compare instructions.

'-msmall-divides'
     Use table lookup optimization for small signed integer divisions.

'-mxl-stack-check'
     This option is deprecated.  Use '-fstack-check' instead.

'-mxl-gp-opt'
     Use GP-relative '.sdata'/'.sbss' sections.

'-mxl-multiply-high'
     Use multiply high instructions for high part of 32x32 multiply.

'-mxl-float-convert'
     Use hardware floating-point conversion instructions.

'-mxl-float-sqrt'
     Use hardware floating-point square root instruction.

'-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a big-endian target.

'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a little-endian target.

'-mxl-reorder'
     Use reorder instructions (swap and byte reversed load/store).

'-mxl-mode-APP-MODEL'
     Select application model APP-MODEL.  Valid models are
     'executable'
          normal executable (default), uses startup code 'crt0.o'.

     'xmdstub'
          for use with Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) based
          software intrusive debug agent called xmdstub.  This uses
          startup file 'crt1.o' and sets the start address of the
          program to 0x800.

     'bootstrap'
          for applications that are loaded using a bootloader.  This
          model uses startup file 'crt2.o' which does not contain a
          processor reset vector handler.  This is suitable for
          transferring control on a processor reset to the bootloader
          rather than the application.

     'novectors'
          for applications that do not require any of the MicroBlaze
          vectors.  This option may be useful for applications running
          within a monitoring application.  This model uses 'crt3.o' as
          a startup file.

     Option '-xl-mode-APP-MODEL' is a deprecated alias for
     '-mxl-mode-APP-MODEL'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: MIPS Options,  Next: MMIX Options,  Prev: MicroBlaze Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.27 MIPS Options
--------------------

'-EB'
     Generate big-endian code.

'-EL'
     Generate little-endian code.  This is the default for 'mips*el-*-*'
     configurations.

'-march=ARCH'
     Generate code that runs on ARCH, which can be the name of a generic
     MIPS ISA, or the name of a particular processor.  The ISA names
     are: 'mips1', 'mips2', 'mips3', 'mips4', 'mips32', 'mips32r2',
     'mips64' and 'mips64r2'.  The processor names are: '4kc', '4km',
     '4kp', '4ksc', '4kec', '4kem', '4kep', '4ksd', '5kc', '5kf',
     '20kc', '24kc', '24kf2_1', '24kf1_1', '24kec', '24kef2_1',
     '24kef1_1', '34kc', '34kf2_1', '34kf1_1', '34kn', '74kc',
     '74kf2_1', '74kf1_1', '74kf3_2', '1004kc', '1004kf2_1',
     '1004kf1_1', 'loongson2e', 'loongson2f', 'loongson3a', 'm4k',
     'm14k', 'm14kc', 'm14ke', 'm14kec', 'octeon', 'octeon+', 'octeon2',
     'orion', 'r2000', 'r3000', 'r3900', 'r4000', 'r4400', 'r4600',
     'r4650', 'r4700', 'r6000', 'r8000', 'rm7000', 'rm9000', 'r10000',
     'r12000', 'r14000', 'r16000', 'sb1', 'sr71000', 'vr4100', 'vr4111',
     'vr4120', 'vr4130', 'vr4300', 'vr5000', 'vr5400', 'vr5500', 'xlr'
     and 'xlp'.  The special value 'from-abi' selects the most
     compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is, 'mips1' for
     32-bit ABIs and 'mips3' for 64-bit ABIs).

     The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value 'native',
     which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
     '-march=native' has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
     processor.

     In processor names, a final '000' can be abbreviated as 'k' (for
     example, '-march=r2k').  Prefixes are optional, and 'vr' may be
     written 'r'.

     Names of the form 'Nf2_1' refer to processors with FPUs clocked at
     half the rate of the core, names of the form 'Nf1_1' refer to
     processors with FPUs clocked at the same rate as the core, and
     names of the form 'Nf3_2' refer to processors with FPUs clocked a
     ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.  For compatibility reasons,
     'Nf' is accepted as a synonym for 'Nf2_1' while 'Nx' and 'Bfx' are
     accepted as synonyms for 'Nf1_1'.

     GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The
     first is '_MIPS_ARCH', which gives the name of target architecture,
     as a string.  The second has the form '_MIPS_ARCH_FOO', where FOO
     is the capitalized value of '_MIPS_ARCH'.  For example,
     '-march=r2000' sets '_MIPS_ARCH' to '"r2000"' and defines the macro
     '_MIPS_ARCH_R2000'.

     Note that the '_MIPS_ARCH' macro uses the processor names given
     above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
     abbreviate '000' as 'k'.  In the case of 'from-abi', the macro
     names the resolved architecture (either '"mips1"' or '"mips3"').
     It names the default architecture when no '-march' option is given.

'-mtune=ARCH'
     Optimize for ARCH.  Among other things, this option controls the
     way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of
     arithmetic operations.  The list of ARCH values is the same as for
     '-march'.

     When this option is not used, GCC optimizes for the processor
     specified by '-march'.  By using '-march' and '-mtune' together, it
     is possible to generate code that runs on a family of processors,
     but optimize the code for one particular member of that family.

     '-mtune' defines the macros '_MIPS_TUNE' and '_MIPS_TUNE_FOO',
     which work in the same way as the '-march' ones described above.

'-mips1'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips1'.

'-mips2'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips2'.

'-mips3'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips3'.

'-mips4'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips4'.

'-mips32'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips32'.

'-mips32r2'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips32r2'.

'-mips64'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips64'.

'-mips64r2'
     Equivalent to '-march=mips64r2'.

'-mips16'
'-mno-mips16'
     Generate (do not generate) MIPS16 code.  If GCC is targeting a
     MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture, it makes use of the MIPS16e ASE.

     MIPS16 code generation can also be controlled on a per-function
     basis by means of 'mips16' and 'nomips16' attributes.  *Note
     Function Attributes::, for more information.

'-mflip-mips16'
     Generate MIPS16 code on alternating functions.  This option is
     provided for regression testing of mixed MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code
     generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling user
     code.

'-minterlink-compressed'
'-mno-interlink-compressed'
     Require (do not require) that code using the standard
     (uncompressed) MIPS ISA be link-compatible with MIPS16 and
     microMIPS code, and vice versa.

     For example, code using the standard ISA encoding cannot jump
     directly to MIPS16 or microMIPS code; it must either use a call or
     an indirect jump.  '-minterlink-compressed' therefore disables
     direct jumps unless GCC knows that the target of the jump is not
     compressed.

'-minterlink-mips16'
'-mno-interlink-mips16'
     Aliases of '-minterlink-compressed' and
     '-mno-interlink-compressed'.  These options predate the microMIPS
     ASE and are retained for backwards compatibility.

'-mabi=32'
'-mabi=o64'
'-mabi=n32'
'-mabi=64'
'-mabi=eabi'
     Generate code for the given ABI.

     Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  GCC normally
     generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture, but
     you can use '-mgp32' to get 32-bit code instead.

     For information about the O64 ABI, see
     <http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html>.

     GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point
     registers are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this
     combination with '-mabi=32' '-mfp64'.  This ABI relies on the
     'mthc1' and 'mfhc1' instructions and is therefore only supported
     for MIPS32R2 processors.

     The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
     same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit register
     rather than a pair of 32-bit registers.  For example, scalar
     floating-point values are returned in '$f0' only, not a '$f0'/'$f1'
     pair.  The set of call-saved registers also remains the same, but
     all 64 bits are saved.

'-mabicalls'
'-mno-abicalls'
     Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for SVR4-style
     dynamic objects.  '-mabicalls' is the default for SVR4-based
     systems.

'-mshared'
'-mno-shared'
     Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent,
     and that can therefore be linked into shared libraries.  This
     option only affects '-mabicalls'.

     All '-mabicalls' code has traditionally been position-independent,
     regardless of options like '-fPIC' and '-fpic'.  However, as an
     extension, the GNU toolchain allows executables to use absolute
     accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter GP
     initialization sequences and generate direct calls to
     locally-defined functions.  This mode is selected by '-mno-shared'.

     '-mno-shared' depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
     objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker.  However, the
     option does not affect the ABI of the final executable; it only
     affects the ABI of relocatable objects.  Using '-mno-shared'
     generally makes executables both smaller and quicker.

     '-mshared' is the default.

'-mplt'
'-mno-plt'
     Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers support
     PLTs and copy relocations.  This option only affects '-mno-shared
     -mabicalls'.  For the n64 ABI, this option has no effect without
     '-msym32'.

     You can make '-mplt' the default by configuring GCC with
     '--with-mips-plt'.  The default is '-mno-plt' otherwise.

'-mxgot'
'-mno-xgot'
     Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global
     offset table.

     GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT.
     While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is
     smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker to
     report an error such as:

          relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar

     If this happens, you should recompile your code with '-mxgot'.
     This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also less
     efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the value of
     a global symbol.

     Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such
     a linker, you should only need to use '-mxgot' when a single object
     file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT entries.  Very few do.

     These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position
     independent code.

'-mgp32'
     Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.

'-mgp64'
     Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.

'-mfp32'
     Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.

'-mfp64'
     Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.

'-mhard-float'
     Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.

'-msoft-float'
     Do not use floating-point coprocessor instructions.  Implement
     floating-point calculations using library calls instead.

'-mno-float'
     Equivalent to '-msoft-float', but additionally asserts that the
     program being compiled does not perform any floating-point
     operations.  This option is presently supported only by some
     bare-metal MIPS configurations, where it may select a special set
     of libraries that lack all floating-point support (including, for
     example, the floating-point 'printf' formats).  If code compiled
     with '-mno-float' accidentally contains floating-point operations,
     it is likely to suffer a link-time or run-time failure.

'-msingle-float'
     Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports
     single-precision operations.

'-mdouble-float'
     Assume that the floating-point coprocessor supports
     double-precision operations.  This is the default.

'-mabs=2008'
'-mabs=legacy'
     These options control the treatment of the special not-a-number
     (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data with the 'abs.fmt' and 'neg.fmt'
     machine instructions.

     By default or when the '-mabs=legacy' is used the legacy treatment
     is selected.  In this case these instructions are considered
     arithmetic and avoided where correct operation is required and the
     input operand might be a NaN. A longer sequence of instructions
     that manipulate the sign bit of floating-point datum manually is
     used instead unless the '-ffinite-math-only' option has also been
     specified.

     The '-mabs=2008' option selects the IEEE 754-2008 treatment.  In
     this case these instructions are considered non-arithmetic and
     therefore operating correctly in all cases, including in particular
     where the input operand is a NaN. These instructions are therefore
     always used for the respective operations.

'-mnan=2008'
'-mnan=legacy'
     These options control the encoding of the special not-a-number
     (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data.

     The '-mnan=legacy' option selects the legacy encoding.  In this
     case quiet NaNs (qNaNs) are denoted by the first bit of their
     trailing significand field being 0, whereas signalling NaNs (sNaNs)
     are denoted by the first bit of their trailing significand field
     being 1.

     The '-mnan=2008' option selects the IEEE 754-2008 encoding.  In
     this case qNaNs are denoted by the first bit of their trailing
     significand field being 1, whereas sNaNs are denoted by the first
     bit of their trailing significand field being 0.

     The default is '-mnan=legacy' unless GCC has been configured with
     '--with-nan=2008'.

'-mllsc'
'-mno-llsc'
     Use (do not use) 'll', 'sc', and 'sync' instructions to implement
     atomic memory built-in functions.  When neither option is
     specified, GCC uses the instructions if the target architecture
     supports them.

     '-mllsc' is useful if the runtime environment can emulate the
     instructions and '-mno-llsc' can be useful when compiling for
     nonstandard ISAs.  You can make either option the default by
     configuring GCC with '--with-llsc' and '--without-llsc'
     respectively.  '--with-llsc' is the default for some
     configurations; see the installation documentation for details.

'-mdsp'
'-mno-dsp'
     Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS DSP ASE.  *Note MIPS DSP
     Built-in Functions::.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
     '__mips_dsp'.  It also defines '__mips_dsp_rev' to 1.

'-mdspr2'
'-mno-dspr2'
     Use (do not use) revision 2 of the MIPS DSP ASE.  *Note MIPS DSP
     Built-in Functions::.  This option defines the preprocessor macros
     '__mips_dsp' and '__mips_dspr2'.  It also defines '__mips_dsp_rev'
     to 2.

'-msmartmips'
'-mno-smartmips'
     Use (do not use) the MIPS SmartMIPS ASE.

'-mpaired-single'
'-mno-paired-single'
     Use (do not use) paired-single floating-point instructions.  *Note
     MIPS Paired-Single Support::.  This option requires hardware
     floating-point support to be enabled.

'-mdmx'
'-mno-mdmx'
     Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media Extension instructions.  This
     option can only be used when generating 64-bit code and requires
     hardware floating-point support to be enabled.

'-mips3d'
'-mno-mips3d'
     Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE.  *Note MIPS-3D Built-in
     Functions::.  The option '-mips3d' implies '-mpaired-single'.

'-mmicromips'
'-mno-micromips'
     Generate (do not generate) microMIPS code.

     MicroMIPS code generation can also be controlled on a per-function
     basis by means of 'micromips' and 'nomicromips' attributes.  *Note
     Function Attributes::, for more information.

'-mmt'
'-mno-mt'
     Use (do not use) MT Multithreading instructions.

'-mmcu'
'-mno-mcu'
     Use (do not use) the MIPS MCU ASE instructions.

'-meva'
'-mno-eva'
     Use (do not use) the MIPS Enhanced Virtual Addressing instructions.

'-mvirt'
'-mno-virt'
     Use (do not use) the MIPS Virtualization Application Specific
     instructions.

'-mlong64'
     Force 'long' types to be 64 bits wide.  See '-mlong32' for an
     explanation of the default and the way that the pointer size is
     determined.

'-mlong32'
     Force 'long', 'int', and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.

     The default size of 'int's, 'long's and pointers depends on the
     ABI.  All the supported ABIs use 32-bit 'int's.  The n64 ABI uses
     64-bit 'long's, as does the 64-bit EABI; the others use 32-bit
     'long's.  Pointers are the same size as 'long's, or the same size
     as integer registers, whichever is smaller.

'-msym32'
'-mno-sym32'
     Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values,
     regardless of the selected ABI.  This option is useful in
     combination with '-mabi=64' and '-mno-abicalls' because it allows
     GCC to generate shorter and faster references to symbolic
     addresses.

'-G NUM'
     Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data section
     if that data is no bigger than NUM bytes.  GCC can then generate
     more efficient accesses to the data; see '-mgpopt' for details.

     The default '-G' option depends on the configuration.

'-mlocal-sdata'
'-mno-local-sdata'
     Extend (do not extend) the '-G' behavior to local data too, such as
     to static variables in C.  '-mlocal-sdata' is the default for all
     configurations.

     If the linker complains that an application is using too much small
     data, you might want to try rebuilding the less
     performance-critical parts with '-mno-local-sdata'.  You might also
     want to build large libraries with '-mno-local-sdata', so that the
     libraries leave more room for the main program.

'-mextern-sdata'
'-mno-extern-sdata'
     Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data is in a small
     data section if the size of that data is within the '-G' limit.
     '-mextern-sdata' is the default for all configurations.

     If you compile a module MOD with '-mextern-sdata' '-G NUM'
     '-mgpopt', and MOD references a variable VAR that is no bigger than
     NUM bytes, you must make sure that VAR is placed in a small data
     section.  If VAR is defined by another module, you must either
     compile that module with a high-enough '-G' setting or attach a
     'section' attribute to VAR's definition.  If VAR is common, you
     must link the application with a high-enough '-G' setting.

     The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to compile and
     link every module with the same '-G' option.  However, you may wish
     to build a library that supports several different small data
     limits.  You can do this by compiling the library with the highest
     supported '-G' setting and additionally using '-mno-extern-sdata'
     to stop the library from making assumptions about
     externally-defined data.

'-mgpopt'
'-mno-gpopt'
     Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are known to
     be in a small data section; see '-G', '-mlocal-sdata' and
     '-mextern-sdata'.  '-mgpopt' is the default for all configurations.

     '-mno-gpopt' is useful for cases where the '$gp' register might not
     hold the value of '_gp'.  For example, if the code is part of a
     library that might be used in a boot monitor, programs that call
     boot monitor routines pass an unknown value in '$gp'.  (In such
     situations, the boot monitor itself is usually compiled with
     '-G0'.)

     '-mno-gpopt' implies '-mno-local-sdata' and '-mno-extern-sdata'.

'-membedded-data'
'-mno-embedded-data'
     Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible,
     then next in the small data section if possible, otherwise in data.
     This gives slightly slower code than the default, but reduces the
     amount of RAM required when executing, and thus may be preferred
     for some embedded systems.

'-muninit-const-in-rodata'
'-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata'
     Put uninitialized 'const' variables in the read-only data section.
     This option is only meaningful in conjunction with
     '-membedded-data'.

'-mcode-readable=SETTING'
     Specify whether GCC may generate code that reads from executable
     sections.  There are three possible settings:

     '-mcode-readable=yes'
          Instructions may freely access executable sections.  This is
          the default setting.

     '-mcode-readable=pcrel'
          MIPS16 PC-relative load instructions can access executable
          sections, but other instructions must not do so.  This option
          is useful on 4KSc and 4KSd processors when the code TLBs have
          the Read Inhibit bit set.  It is also useful on processors
          that can be configured to have a dual instruction/data SRAM
          interface and that, like the M4K, automatically redirect
          PC-relative loads to the instruction RAM.

     '-mcode-readable=no'
          Instructions must not access executable sections.  This option
          can be useful on targets that are configured to have a dual
          instruction/data SRAM interface but that (unlike the M4K) do
          not automatically redirect PC-relative loads to the
          instruction RAM.

'-msplit-addresses'
'-mno-split-addresses'
     Enable (disable) use of the '%hi()' and '%lo()' assembler
     relocation operators.  This option has been superseded by
     '-mexplicit-relocs' but is retained for backwards compatibility.

'-mexplicit-relocs'
'-mno-explicit-relocs'
     Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing with
     symbolic addresses.  The alternative, selected by
     '-mno-explicit-relocs', is to use assembler macros instead.

     '-mexplicit-relocs' is the default if GCC was configured to use an
     assembler that supports relocation operators.

'-mcheck-zero-division'
'-mno-check-zero-division'
     Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.

     The default is '-mcheck-zero-division'.

'-mdivide-traps'
'-mdivide-breaks'
     MIPS systems check for division by zero by generating either a
     conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using traps results in
     smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and later.  Also,
     some versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that prevents trap
     from generating the proper signal ('SIGFPE').  Use '-mdivide-traps'
     to allow conditional traps on architectures that support them and
     '-mdivide-breaks' to force the use of breaks.

     The default is usually '-mdivide-traps', but this can be overridden
     at configure time using '--with-divide=breaks'.  Divide-by-zero
     checks can be completely disabled using '-mno-check-zero-division'.

'-mmemcpy'
'-mno-memcpy'
     Force (do not force) the use of 'memcpy()' for non-trivial block
     moves.  The default is '-mno-memcpy', which allows GCC to inline
     most constant-sized copies.

'-mlong-calls'
'-mno-long-calls'
     Disable (do not disable) use of the 'jal' instruction.  Calling
     functions using 'jal' is more efficient but requires the caller and
     callee to be in the same 256 megabyte segment.

     This option has no effect on abicalls code.  The default is
     '-mno-long-calls'.

'-mmad'
'-mno-mad'
     Enable (disable) use of the 'mad', 'madu' and 'mul' instructions,
     as provided by the R4650 ISA.

'-mimadd'
'-mno-imadd'
     Enable (disable) use of the 'madd' and 'msub' integer instructions.
     The default is '-mimadd' on architectures that support 'madd' and
     'msub' except for the 74k architecture where it was found to
     generate slower code.

'-mfused-madd'
'-mno-fused-madd'
     Enable (disable) use of the floating-point multiply-accumulate
     instructions, when they are available.  The default is
     '-mfused-madd'.

     On the R8000 CPU when multiply-accumulate instructions are used,
     the intermediate product is calculated to infinite precision and is
     not subject to the FCSR Flush to Zero bit.  This may be undesirable
     in some circumstances.  On other processors the result is
     numerically identical to the equivalent computation using separate
     multiply, add, subtract and negate instructions.

'-nocpp'
     Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user
     assembler files (with a '.s' suffix) when assembling them.

'-mfix-24k'
'-mno-fix-24k'
     Work around the 24K E48 (lost data on stores during refill) errata.
     The workarounds are implemented by the assembler rather than by
     GCC.

'-mfix-r4000'
'-mno-fix-r4000'
     Work around certain R4000 CPU errata:
        - A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect result
          if executed immediately after starting an integer division.
        - A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect result
          if executed while an integer multiplication is in progress.
        - An integer division may give an incorrect result if started in
          a delay slot of a taken branch or a jump.

'-mfix-r4400'
'-mno-fix-r4400'
     Work around certain R4400 CPU errata:
        - A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect result
          if executed immediately after starting an integer division.

'-mfix-r10000'
'-mno-fix-r10000'
     Work around certain R10000 errata:
        - 'll'/'sc' sequences may not behave atomically on revisions
          prior to 3.0.  They may deadlock on revisions 2.6 and earlier.

     This option can only be used if the target architecture supports
     branch-likely instructions.  '-mfix-r10000' is the default when
     '-march=r10000' is used; '-mno-fix-r10000' is the default
     otherwise.

'-mfix-rm7000'
'-mno-fix-rm7000'
     Work around the RM7000 'dmult'/'dmultu' errata.  The workarounds
     are implemented by the assembler rather than by GCC.

'-mfix-vr4120'
'-mno-fix-vr4120'
     Work around certain VR4120 errata:
        - 'dmultu' does not always produce the correct result.
        - 'div' and 'ddiv' do not always produce the correct result if
          one of the operands is negative.
     The workarounds for the division errata rely on special functions
     in 'libgcc.a'.  At present, these functions are only provided by
     the 'mips64vr*-elf' configurations.

     Other VR4120 errata require a NOP to be inserted between certain
     pairs of instructions.  These errata are handled by the assembler,
     not by GCC itself.

'-mfix-vr4130'
     Work around the VR4130 'mflo'/'mfhi' errata.  The workarounds are
     implemented by the assembler rather than by GCC, although GCC
     avoids using 'mflo' and 'mfhi' if the VR4130 'macc', 'macchi',
     'dmacc' and 'dmacchi' instructions are available instead.

'-mfix-sb1'
'-mno-fix-sb1'
     Work around certain SB-1 CPU core errata.  (This flag currently
     works around the SB-1 revision 2 "F1" and "F2" floating-point
     errata.)

'-mr10k-cache-barrier=SETTING'
     Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid the
     side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.

     In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the
     outcome of a conditional branch and speculatively executes
     instructions from the "taken" branch.  It later aborts these
     instructions if the predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the
     R10K, even aborted instructions can have side effects.

     This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the
     system, kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed
     store may load the target memory into cache and mark the cache line
     as dirty, even if the store itself is later aborted.  If a DMA
     operation writes to the same area of memory before the "dirty" line
     is flushed, the cached data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the
     R10K processor manual for a full description, including other
     potential problems.

     One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every
     memory access that might be speculatively executed and that might
     have side effects even if aborted.  '-mr10k-cache-barrier=SETTING'
     controls GCC's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
     aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
     side effects:

       1. the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;

       2. the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;

       3. the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant
          address.

     It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
     accesses to these regions are indeed safe.

     If the input program contains a function declaration such as:

          void foo (void);

     then the implementation of 'foo' must allow 'j foo' and 'jal foo'
     to be executed speculatively.  GCC honors this restriction for
     functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC functions (such
     as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.

     The option has three forms:

     '-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store'
          Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
          speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
          if aborted.

     '-mr10k-cache-barrier=store'
          Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be
          speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
          if aborted.

     '-mr10k-cache-barrier=none'
          Disable the insertion of cache barriers.  This is the default
          setting.

'-mflush-func=FUNC'
'-mno-flush-func'
     Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches, or to
     not call any such function.  If called, the function must take the
     same arguments as the common '_flush_func()', that is, the address
     of the memory range for which the cache is being flushed, the size
     of the memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both caches).  The
     default depends on the target GCC was configured for, but commonly
     is either '_flush_func' or '__cpu_flush'.

'mbranch-cost=NUM'
     Set the cost of branches to roughly NUM "simple" instructions.
     This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
     consistent results across releases.  A zero cost redundantly
     selects the default, which is based on the '-mtune' setting.

'-mbranch-likely'
'-mno-branch-likely'
     Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions, regardless of
     the default for the selected architecture.  By default, Branch
     Likely instructions may be generated if they are supported by the
     selected architecture.  An exception is for the MIPS32 and MIPS64
     architectures and processors that implement those architectures;
     for those, Branch Likely instructions are not be generated by
     default because the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures specifically
     deprecate their use.

'-mfp-exceptions'
'-mno-fp-exceptions'
     Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled.  This affects how FP
     instructions are scheduled for some processors.  The default is
     that FP exceptions are enabled.

     For instance, on the SB-1, if FP exceptions are disabled, and we
     are emitting 64-bit code, then we can use both FP pipes.
     Otherwise, we can only use one FP pipe.

'-mvr4130-align'
'-mno-vr4130-align'
     The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only issue two
     instructions together if the first one is 8-byte aligned.  When
     this option is enabled, GCC aligns pairs of instructions that it
     thinks should execute in parallel.

     This option only has an effect when optimizing for the VR4130.  It
     normally makes code faster, but at the expense of making it bigger.
     It is enabled by default at optimization level '-O3'.

'-msynci'
'-mno-synci'
     Enable (disable) generation of 'synci' instructions on
     architectures that support it.  The 'synci' instructions (if
     enabled) are generated when '__builtin___clear_cache()' is
     compiled.

     This option defaults to '-mno-synci', but the default can be
     overridden by configuring with '--with-synci'.

     When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally
     safe to use 'synci'.  However, on many multi-core (SMP) systems, it
     does not invalidate the instruction caches on all cores and may
     lead to undefined behavior.

'-mrelax-pic-calls'
'-mno-relax-pic-calls'
     Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via register
     '$25' into direct calls.  This is only possible if the linker can
     resolve the destination at link-time and if the destination is
     within range for a direct call.

     '-mrelax-pic-calls' is the default if GCC was configured to use an
     assembler and a linker that support the '.reloc' assembly directive
     and '-mexplicit-relocs' is in effect.  With '-mno-explicit-relocs',
     this optimization can be performed by the assembler and the linker
     alone without help from the compiler.

'-mmcount-ra-address'
'-mno-mcount-ra-address'
     Emit (do not emit) code that allows '_mcount' to modify the calling
     function's return address.  When enabled, this option extends the
     usual '_mcount' interface with a new RA-ADDRESS parameter, which
     has type 'intptr_t *' and is passed in register '$12'.  '_mcount'
     can then modify the return address by doing both of the following:
        * Returning the new address in register '$31'.
        * Storing the new address in '*RA-ADDRESS', if RA-ADDRESS is
          nonnull.

     The default is '-mno-mcount-ra-address'.

3.17.28 MMIX Options
--------------------

These options are defined for the MMIX:

'-mlibfuncs'
'-mno-libfuncs'
     Specify that intrinsic library functions are being compiled,
     passing all values in registers, no matter the size.

'-mepsilon'
'-mno-epsilon'
     Generate floating-point comparison instructions that compare with
     respect to the 'rE' epsilon register.

'-mabi=mmixware'
'-mabi=gnu'
     Generate code that passes function parameters and return values
     that (in the called function) are seen as registers '$0' and up, as
     opposed to the GNU ABI which uses global registers '$231' and up.

'-mzero-extend'
'-mno-zero-extend'
     When reading data from memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits, use
     (do not use) zero-extending load instructions by default, rather
     than sign-extending ones.

'-mknuthdiv'
'-mno-knuthdiv'
     Make the result of a division yielding a remainder have the same
     sign as the divisor.  With the default, '-mno-knuthdiv', the sign
     of the remainder follows the sign of the dividend.  Both methods
     are arithmetically valid, the latter being almost exclusively used.

'-mtoplevel-symbols'
'-mno-toplevel-symbols'
     Prepend (do not prepend) a ':' to all global symbols, so the
     assembly code can be used with the 'PREFIX' assembly directive.

'-melf'
     Generate an executable in the ELF format, rather than the default
     'mmo' format used by the 'mmix' simulator.

'-mbranch-predict'
'-mno-branch-predict'
     Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when static
     branch prediction indicates a probable branch.

'-mbase-addresses'
'-mno-base-addresses'
     Generate (do not generate) code that uses _base addresses_.  Using
     a base address automatically generates a request (handled by the
     assembler and the linker) for a constant to be set up in a global
     register.  The register is used for one or more base address
     requests within the range 0 to 255 from the value held in the
     register.  The generally leads to short and fast code, but the
     number of different data items that can be addressed is limited.
     This means that a program that uses lots of static data may require
     '-mno-base-addresses'.

'-msingle-exit'
'-mno-single-exit'
     Force (do not force) generated code to have a single exit point in
     each function.


File: gcc.info,  Node: MN10300 Options,  Next: Moxie Options,  Prev: MMIX Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.29 MN10300 Options
-----------------------

These '-m' options are defined for Matsushita MN10300 architectures:

'-mmult-bug'
     Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the
     MN10300 processors.  This is the default.

'-mno-mult-bug'
     Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for
     the MN10300 processors.

'-mam33'
     Generate code using features specific to the AM33 processor.

'-mno-am33'
     Do not generate code using features specific to the AM33 processor.
     This is the default.

'-mam33-2'
     Generate code using features specific to the AM33/2.0 processor.

'-mam34'
     Generate code using features specific to the AM34 processor.

'-mtune=CPU-TYPE'
     Use the timing characteristics of the indicated CPU type when
     scheduling instructions.  This does not change the targeted
     processor type.  The CPU type must be one of 'mn10300', 'am33',
     'am33-2' or 'am34'.

'-mreturn-pointer-on-d0'
     When generating a function that returns a pointer, return the
     pointer in both 'a0' and 'd0'.  Otherwise, the pointer is returned
     only in 'a0', and attempts to call such functions without a
     prototype result in errors.  Note that this option is on by
     default; use '-mno-return-pointer-on-d0' to disable it.

'-mno-crt0'
     Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.

'-mrelax'
     Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation
     optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and absolute memory
     addresses.  This option only has an effect when used on the command
     line for the final link step.

     This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.

'-mliw'
     Allow the compiler to generate _Long Instruction Word_ instructions
     if the target is the 'AM33' or later.  This is the default.  This
     option defines the preprocessor macro '__LIW__'.

'-mnoliw'
     Do not allow the compiler to generate _Long Instruction Word_
     instructions.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
     '__NO_LIW__'.

'-msetlb'
     Allow the compiler to generate the _SETLB_ and _Lcc_ instructions
     if the target is the 'AM33' or later.  This is the default.  This
     option defines the preprocessor macro '__SETLB__'.

'-mnosetlb'
     Do not allow the compiler to generate _SETLB_ or _Lcc_
     instructions.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
     '__NO_SETLB__'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Moxie Options,  Next: MSP430 Options,  Prev: MN10300 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.30 Moxie Options
---------------------

'-meb'
     Generate big-endian code.  This is the default for 'moxie-*-*'
     configurations.

'-mel'
     Generate little-endian code.

'-mno-crt0'
     Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.


File: gcc.info,  Node: MSP430 Options,  Next: NDS32 Options,  Prev: Moxie Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.31 MSP430 Options
----------------------

These options are defined for the MSP430:

'-masm-hex'
     Force assembly output to always use hex constants.  Normally such
     constants are signed decimals, but this option is available for
     testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.

'-mmcu='
     Select the MCU to target.  This is used to create a C preprocessor
     symbol based upon the MCU name, converted to upper case and pre-
     and post- fixed with '__'.  This in turn will be used by the
     'msp430.h' header file to select an MCU specific supplimentary
     header file.

     The option also sets the ISA to use.  If the MCU name is one that
     is known to only support the 430 ISA then that is selected,
     otherwise the 430X ISA is selected.  A generic MCU name of 'msp430'
     can also be used to select the 430 ISA. Similarly the generic
     'msp430x' MCU name will select the 430X ISA.

     In addition an MCU specific linker script will be added to the
     linker command line.  The script's name is the name of the MCU with
     '.ld' appended.  Thus specifying '-mmcu=xxx' on the gcc command
     line will define the C preprocessor symbol '__XXX__' and cause the
     linker to search for a script called 'xxx.ld'.

     This option is also passed on to the assembler.

'-mcpu='
     Specifies the ISA to use.  Accepted values are 'msp430', 'msp430x'
     and 'msp430xv2'.  This option is deprecated.  The '-mmcu=' option
     should be used to select the ISA.

'-msim'
     Link to the simulator runtime libraries and linker script.
     Overrides any scripts that would be selected by the '-mmcu='
     option.

'-mlarge'
     Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 32-bit 'size_t').

'-msmall'
     Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit 'size_t').

'-mrelax'
     This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows the
     linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done until
     the final link.

'mhwmult='
     Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the target.
     Accepted values are 'none' for no hardware multiply, '16bit' for
     the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early MCUs.  '32bit'
     for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and 'f5series'
     for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by F5-series MCUs.  A value of
     'auto' can also be given.  This tells GCC to deduce the hardware
     multiply support based upon the MCU name provided by the '-mmcu'
     option.  If no '-mmcu' option is specified then '32bit' hardware
     multiply support is assumed.  'auto' is the default setting.

     Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a library
     routine.  This saves space in the generated code.  When compiling
     at '-O3' or higher however the hardware multiplier is invoked
     inline.  This makes for bigger, but faster code.

     The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running
     and restore the previous interrupt state when they finish.  This
     makes them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as in
     normal code.

'-minrt'
     Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static
     initializers or constructors.  This is intended for
     memory-constrained devices.  The compiler will include special
     symbols in some objects that tell the linker and runtime which code
     fragments are required.

3.17.32 NDS32 Options
---------------------

These options are defined for NDS32 implementations:

'-mbig-endian'
     Generate code in big-endian mode.

'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code in little-endian mode.

'-mreduced-regs'
     Use reduced-set registers for register allocation.

'-mfull-regs'
     Use full-set registers for register allocation.

'-mcmov'
     Generate conditional move instructions.

'-mno-cmov'
     Do not generate conditional move instructions.

'-mperf-ext'
     Generate performance extension instructions.

'-mno-perf-ext'
     Do not generate performance extension instructions.

'-mv3push'
     Generate v3 push25/pop25 instructions.

'-mno-v3push'
     Do not generate v3 push25/pop25 instructions.

'-m16-bit'
     Generate 16-bit instructions.

'-mno-16-bit'
     Do not generate 16-bit instructions.

'-mgp-direct'
     Generate GP base instructions directly.

'-mno-gp-direct'
     Do no generate GP base instructions directly.

'-misr-vector-size=NUM'
     Specify the size of each interrupt vector, which must be 4 or 16.

'-mcache-block-size=NUM'
     Specify the size of each cache block, which must be a power of 2
     between 4 and 512.

'-march=ARCH'
     Specify the name of the target architecture.

'-mforce-fp-as-gp'
     Prevent $fp being allocated during register allocation so that
     compiler is able to force performing fp-as-gp optimization.

'-mforbid-fp-as-gp'
     Forbid using $fp to access static and global variables.  This
     option strictly forbids fp-as-gp optimization regardless of
     '-mforce-fp-as-gp'.

'-mex9'
     Use special directives to guide linker doing ex9 optimization.

'-mctor-dtor'
     Enable constructor/destructor feature.

'-mrelax'

3.17.33 Nios II Options
-----------------------

These are the options defined for the Altera Nios II processor.

'-G NUM'
     Put global and static objects less than or equal to NUM bytes into
     the small data or BSS sections instead of the normal data or BSS
     sections.  The default value of NUM is 8.

'-mgpopt'
'-mno-gpopt'
     Generate (do not generate) GP-relative accesses for objects in the
     small data or BSS sections.  The default is '-mgpopt' except when
     '-fpic' or '-fPIC' is specified to generate position-independent
     code.  Note that the Nios II ABI does not permit GP-relative
     accesses from shared libraries.

     You may need to specify '-mno-gpopt' explicitly when building
     programs that include large amounts of small data, including large
     GOT data sections.  In this case, the 16-bit offset for GP-relative
     addressing may not be large enough to allow access to the entire
     small data section.

'-mel'
'-meb'
     Generate little-endian (default) or big-endian (experimental) code,
     respectively.

'-mbypass-cache'
'-mno-bypass-cache'
     Force all load and store instructions to always bypass cache by
     using I/O variants of the instructions.  The default is not to
     bypass the cache.

'-mno-cache-volatile'
'-mcache-volatile'
     Volatile memory access bypass the cache using the I/O variants of
     the load and store instructions.  The default is not to bypass the
     cache.

'-mno-fast-sw-div'
'-mfast-sw-div'
     Do not use table-based fast divide for small numbers.  The default
     is to use the fast divide at '-O3' and above.

'-mno-hw-mul'
'-mhw-mul'
'-mno-hw-mulx'
'-mhw-mulx'
'-mno-hw-div'
'-mhw-div'
     Enable or disable emitting 'mul', 'mulx' and 'div' family of
     instructions by the compiler.  The default is to emit 'mul' and not
     emit 'div' and 'mulx'.

'-mcustom-INSN=N'
'-mno-custom-INSN'
     Each '-mcustom-INSN=N' option enables use of a custom instruction
     with encoding N when generating code that uses INSN.  For example,
     '-mcustom-fadds=253' generates custom instruction 253 for
     single-precision floating-point add operations instead of the
     default behavior of using a library call.

     The following values of INSN are supported.  Except as otherwise
     noted, floating-point operations are expected to be implemented
     with normal IEEE 754 semantics and correspond directly to the C
     operators or the equivalent GCC built-in functions (*note Other
     Builtins::).

     Single-precision floating point:

     'fadds', 'fsubs', 'fdivs', 'fmuls'
          Binary arithmetic operations.

     'fnegs'
          Unary negation.

     'fabss'
          Unary absolute value.

     'fcmpeqs', 'fcmpges', 'fcmpgts', 'fcmples', 'fcmplts', 'fcmpnes'
          Comparison operations.

     'fmins', 'fmaxs'
          Floating-point minimum and maximum.  These instructions are
          only generated if '-ffinite-math-only' is specified.

     'fsqrts'
          Unary square root operation.

     'fcoss', 'fsins', 'ftans', 'fatans', 'fexps', 'flogs'
          Floating-point trigonometric and exponential functions.  These
          instructions are only generated if
          '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is also specified.

     Double-precision floating point:

     'faddd', 'fsubd', 'fdivd', 'fmuld'
          Binary arithmetic operations.

     'fnegd'
          Unary negation.

     'fabsd'
          Unary absolute value.

     'fcmpeqd', 'fcmpged', 'fcmpgtd', 'fcmpled', 'fcmpltd', 'fcmpned'
          Comparison operations.

     'fmind', 'fmaxd'
          Double-precision minimum and maximum.  These instructions are
          only generated if '-ffinite-math-only' is specified.

     'fsqrtd'
          Unary square root operation.

     'fcosd', 'fsind', 'ftand', 'fatand', 'fexpd', 'flogd'
          Double-precision trigonometric and exponential functions.
          These instructions are only generated if
          '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is also specified.

     Conversions:
     'fextsd'
          Conversion from single precision to double precision.

     'ftruncds'
          Conversion from double precision to single precision.

     'fixsi', 'fixsu', 'fixdi', 'fixdu'
          Conversion from floating point to signed or unsigned integer
          types, with truncation towards zero.

     'floatis', 'floatus', 'floatid', 'floatud'
          Conversion from signed or unsigned integer types to
          floating-point types.

     In addition, all of the following transfer instructions for
     internal registers X and Y must be provided to use any of the
     double-precision floating-point instructions.  Custom instructions
     taking two double-precision source operands expect the first
     operand in the 64-bit register X. The other operand (or only
     operand of a unary operation) is given to the custom arithmetic
     instruction with the least significant half in source register SRC1
     and the most significant half in SRC2.  A custom instruction that
     returns a double-precision result returns the most significant 32
     bits in the destination register and the other half in 32-bit
     register Y. GCC automatically generates the necessary code
     sequences to write register X and/or read register Y when
     double-precision floating-point instructions are used.

     'fwrx'
          Write SRC1 into the least significant half of X and SRC2 into
          the most significant half of X.

     'fwry'
          Write SRC1 into Y.

     'frdxhi', 'frdxlo'
          Read the most or least (respectively) significant half of X
          and store it in DEST.

     'frdy'
          Read the value of Y and store it into DEST.

     Note that you can gain more local control over generation of Nios
     II custom instructions by using the 'target("custom-INSN=N")' and
     'target("no-custom-INSN")' function attributes (*note Function
     Attributes::) or pragmas (*note Function Specific Option
     Pragmas::).

'-mcustom-fpu-cfg=NAME'

     This option enables a predefined, named set of custom instruction
     encodings (see '-mcustom-INSN' above).  Currently, the following
     sets are defined:

     '-mcustom-fpu-cfg=60-1' is equivalent to:
          -mcustom-fmuls=252
          -mcustom-fadds=253
          -mcustom-fsubs=254
          -fsingle-precision-constant

     '-mcustom-fpu-cfg=60-2' is equivalent to:
          -mcustom-fmuls=252
          -mcustom-fadds=253
          -mcustom-fsubs=254
          -mcustom-fdivs=255
          -fsingle-precision-constant

     '-mcustom-fpu-cfg=72-3' is equivalent to:
          -mcustom-floatus=243
          -mcustom-fixsi=244
          -mcustom-floatis=245
          -mcustom-fcmpgts=246
          -mcustom-fcmples=249
          -mcustom-fcmpeqs=250
          -mcustom-fcmpnes=251
          -mcustom-fmuls=252
          -mcustom-fadds=253
          -mcustom-fsubs=254
          -mcustom-fdivs=255
          -fsingle-precision-constant

     Custom instruction assignments given by individual '-mcustom-INSN='
     options override those given by '-mcustom-fpu-cfg=', regardless of
     the order of the options on the command line.

     Note that you can gain more local control over selection of a FPU
     configuration by using the 'target("custom-fpu-cfg=NAME")' function
     attribute (*note Function Attributes::) or pragma (*note Function
     Specific Option Pragmas::).

 These additional '-m' options are available for the Altera Nios II ELF
(bare-metal) target:

'-mhal'
     Link with HAL BSP. This suppresses linking with the GCC-provided C
     runtime startup and termination code, and is typically used in
     conjunction with '-msys-crt0=' to specify the location of the
     alternate startup code provided by the HAL BSP.

'-msmallc'
     Link with a limited version of the C library, '-lsmallc', rather
     than Newlib.

'-msys-crt0=STARTFILE'
     STARTFILE is the file name of the startfile (crt0) to use when
     linking.  This option is only useful in conjunction with '-mhal'.

'-msys-lib=SYSTEMLIB'
     SYSTEMLIB is the library name of the library that provides
     low-level system calls required by the C library, e.g.  'read' and
     'write'.  This option is typically used to link with a library
     provided by a HAL BSP.

3.17.34 PDP-11 Options
----------------------

These options are defined for the PDP-11:

'-mfpu'
     Use hardware FPP floating point.  This is the default.  (FIS
     floating point on the PDP-11/40 is not supported.)

'-msoft-float'
     Do not use hardware floating point.

'-mac0'
     Return floating-point results in ac0 (fr0 in Unix assembler
     syntax).

'-mno-ac0'
     Return floating-point results in memory.  This is the default.

'-m40'
     Generate code for a PDP-11/40.

'-m45'
     Generate code for a PDP-11/45.  This is the default.

'-m10'
     Generate code for a PDP-11/10.

'-mbcopy-builtin'
     Use inline 'movmemhi' patterns for copying memory.  This is the
     default.

'-mbcopy'
     Do not use inline 'movmemhi' patterns for copying memory.

'-mint16'
'-mno-int32'
     Use 16-bit 'int'.  This is the default.

'-mint32'
'-mno-int16'
     Use 32-bit 'int'.

'-mfloat64'
'-mno-float32'
     Use 64-bit 'float'.  This is the default.

'-mfloat32'
'-mno-float64'
     Use 32-bit 'float'.

'-mabshi'
     Use 'abshi2' pattern.  This is the default.

'-mno-abshi'
     Do not use 'abshi2' pattern.

'-mbranch-expensive'
     Pretend that branches are expensive.  This is for experimenting
     with code generation only.

'-mbranch-cheap'
     Do not pretend that branches are expensive.  This is the default.

'-munix-asm'
     Use Unix assembler syntax.  This is the default when configured for
     'pdp11-*-bsd'.

3.17.35 picoChip Options
------------------------

These '-m' options are defined for picoChip implementations:

'-mae=AE_TYPE'
     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
     parameters for array element type AE_TYPE.  Supported values for
     AE_TYPE are 'ANY', 'MUL', and 'MAC'.

     '-mae=ANY' selects a completely generic AE type.  Code generated
     with this option runs on any of the other AE types.  The code is
     not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific AE type,
     and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not work
     properly on all types of AE.

     '-mae=MUL' selects a MUL AE type.  This is the most useful AE type
     for compiled code, and is the default.

     '-mae=MAC' selects a DSP-style MAC AE. Code compiled with this
     option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char)
     manipulation, since the DSP AE does not provide hardware support
     for byte load/stores.

'-msymbol-as-address'
     Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in
     a load/store instruction, without first loading it into a register.
     Typically, the use of this option generates larger programs, which
     run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the results
     vary from program to program, so it is left as a user option,
     rather than being permanently enabled.

'-mno-inefficient-warnings'
     Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
     warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
     performs byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE type.  The MAC
     AE has no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all
     byte load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store
     operations.  This is inefficient and a warning is generated to
     indicate that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations,
     or to target an AE type that has the necessary hardware support.
     This option disables these warnings.

'-msim'
     Links in additional target libraries to support operation within a
     simulator.

'-mmul=none'
'-mmul=g13'
'-mmul=rl78'
     Specifies the type of hardware multiplication support to be used.
     The default is 'none', which uses software multiplication
     functions.  The 'g13' option is for the hardware multiply/divide
     peripheral only on the RL78/G13 targets.  The 'rl78' option is for
     the standard hardware multiplication defined in the RL78 software
     manual.

3.17.38 IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options
---------------------------------------

These '-m' options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:
'-mpowerpc-gpopt'
'-mno-powerpc-gpopt'
'-mpowerpc-gfxopt'
'-mno-powerpc-gfxopt'
'-mpowerpc64'
'-mno-powerpc64'
'-mmfcrf'
'-mno-mfcrf'
'-mpopcntb'
'-mno-popcntb'
'-mpopcntd'
'-mno-popcntd'
'-mfprnd'
'-mno-fprnd'
'-mcmpb'
'-mno-cmpb'
'-mmfpgpr'
'-mno-mfpgpr'
'-mhard-dfp'
'-mno-hard-dfp'
     You use these options to specify which instructions are available
     on the processor you are using.  The default value of these options
     is determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
     '-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' overrides the specification of these options.  We
     recommend you use the '-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' option rather than the
     options listed above.

     Specifying '-mpowerpc-gpopt' allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC
     architecture instructions in the General Purpose group, including
     floating-point square root.  Specifying '-mpowerpc-gfxopt' allows
     GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
     Graphics group, including floating-point select.

     The '-mmfcrf' option allows GCC to generate the move from condition
     register field instruction implemented on the POWER4 processor and
     other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01 architecture.  The
     '-mpopcntb' option allows GCC to generate the popcount and
     double-precision FP reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on
     the POWER5 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC
     V2.02 architecture.  The '-mpopcntd' option allows GCC to generate
     the popcount instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor and
     other processors that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.  The
     '-mfprnd' option allows GCC to generate the FP round to integer
     instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other
     processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.  The
     '-mcmpb' option allows GCC to generate the compare bytes
     instruction implemented on the POWER6 processor and other
     processors that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.  The
     '-mmfpgpr' option allows GCC to generate the FP move to/from
     general-purpose register instructions implemented on the POWER6X
     processor and other processors that support the extended PowerPC
     V2.05 architecture.  The '-mhard-dfp' option allows GCC to generate
     the decimal floating-point instructions implemented on some POWER
     processors.

     The '-mpowerpc64' option allows GCC to generate the additional
     64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64
     architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.
     GCC defaults to '-mno-powerpc64'.

'-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set architecture type, register usage, and instruction scheduling
     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  Supported values for
     CPU_TYPE are '401', '403', '405', '405fp', '440', '440fp', '464',
     '464fp', '476', '476fp', '505', '601', '602', '603', '603e', '604',
     '604e', '620', '630', '740', '7400', '7450', '750', '801', '821',
     '823', '860', '970', '8540', 'a2', 'e300c2', 'e300c3', 'e500mc',
     'e500mc64', 'e5500', 'e6500', 'ec603e', 'G3', 'G4', 'G5', 'titan',
     'power3', 'power4', 'power5', 'power5+', 'power6', 'power6x',
     'power7', 'power8', 'powerpc', 'powerpc64', and 'rs64'.

     '-mcpu=powerpc', and '-mcpu=powerpc64' specify pure 32-bit PowerPC
     and 64-bit PowerPC architecture machine types, with an appropriate,
     generic processor model assumed for scheduling purposes.

     The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated
     under those options runs best on that processor, and may not run at
     all on others.

     The '-mcpu' options automatically enable or disable the following
     options:

          -maltivec  -mfprnd  -mhard-float  -mmfcrf  -mmultiple
          -mpopcntb -mpopcntd  -mpowerpc64
          -mpowerpc-gpopt  -mpowerpc-gfxopt  -msingle-float -mdouble-float
          -msimple-fpu -mstring  -mmulhw  -mdlmzb  -mmfpgpr -mvsx
          -mcrypto -mdirect-move -mpower8-fusion -mpower8-vector
          -mquad-memory -mquad-memory-atomic

     The particular options set for any particular CPU varies between
     compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to produce
     optimal code for that CPU; it doesn't necessarily reflect the
     actual hardware's capabilities.  If you wish to set an individual
     option to a particular value, you may specify it after the '-mcpu'
     option, like '-mcpu=970 -mno-altivec'.

     On AIX, the '-maltivec' and '-mpowerpc64' options are not enabled
     or disabled by the '-mcpu' option at present because AIX does not
     have full support for these options.  You may still enable or
     disable them individually if you're sure it'll work in your
     environment.

'-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
     CPU_TYPE, but do not set the architecture type or register usage,
     as '-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' does.  The same values for CPU_TYPE are used
     for '-mtune' as for '-mcpu'.  If both are specified, the code
     generated uses the architecture and registers set by '-mcpu', but
     the scheduling parameters set by '-mtune'.

'-mcmodel=small'
     Generate PowerPC64 code for the small model: The TOC is limited to
     64k.

'-mcmodel=medium'
     Generate PowerPC64 code for the medium model: The TOC and other
     static data may be up to a total of 4G in size.

'-mcmodel=large'
     Generate PowerPC64 code for the large model: The TOC may be up to
     4G in size.  Other data and code is only limited by the 64-bit
     address space.

'-maltivec'
'-mno-altivec'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions, and
     also enable the use of built-in functions that allow more direct
     access to the AltiVec instruction set.  You may also need to set
     '-mabi=altivec' to adjust the current ABI with AltiVec ABI
     enhancements.

     When '-maltivec' is used, rather than '-maltivec=le' or
     '-maltivec=be', the element order for Altivec intrinsics such as
     'vec_splat', 'vec_extract', and 'vec_insert' will match array
     element order corresponding to the endianness of the target.  That
     is, element zero identifies the leftmost element in a vector
     register when targeting a big-endian platform, and identifies the
     rightmost element in a vector register when targeting a
     little-endian platform.

'-maltivec=be'
     Generate Altivec instructions using big-endian element order,
     regardless of whether the target is big- or little-endian.  This is
     the default when targeting a big-endian platform.

     The element order is used to interpret element numbers in Altivec
     intrinsics such as 'vec_splat', 'vec_extract', and 'vec_insert'.
     By default, these will match array element order corresponding to
     the endianness for the target.

'-maltivec=le'
     Generate Altivec instructions using little-endian element order,
     regardless of whether the target is big- or little-endian.  This is
     the default when targeting a little-endian platform.  This option
     is currently ignored when targeting a big-endian platform.

     The element order is used to interpret element numbers in Altivec
     intrinsics such as 'vec_splat', 'vec_extract', and 'vec_insert'.
     By default, these will match array element order corresponding to
     the endianness for the target.

'-mvrsave'
'-mno-vrsave'
     Generate VRSAVE instructions when generating AltiVec code.

'-mgen-cell-microcode'
     Generate Cell microcode instructions.

'-mwarn-cell-microcode'
     Warn when a Cell microcode instruction is emitted.  An example of a
     Cell microcode instruction is a variable shift.

'-msecure-plt'
     Generate code that allows 'ld' and 'ld.so' to build executables and
     shared libraries with non-executable '.plt' and '.got' sections.
     This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.

'-mbss-plt'
     Generate code that uses a BSS '.plt' section that 'ld.so' fills in,
     and requires '.plt' and '.got' sections that are both writable and
     executable.  This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.

'-misel'
'-mno-isel'
     This switch enables or disables the generation of ISEL
     instructions.

'-misel=YES/NO'
     This switch has been deprecated.  Use '-misel' and '-mno-isel'
     instead.

'-mspe'
'-mno-spe'
     This switch enables or disables the generation of SPE simd
     instructions.

'-mpaired'
'-mno-paired'
     This switch enables or disables the generation of PAIRED simd
     instructions.

'-mspe=YES/NO'
     This option has been deprecated.  Use '-mspe' and '-mno-spe'
     instead.

'-mvsx'
'-mno-vsx'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) vector/scalar (VSX)
     instructions, and also enable the use of built-in functions that
     allow more direct access to the VSX instruction set.

'-mcrypto'
'-mno-crypto'
     Enable the use (disable) of the built-in functions that allow
     direct access to the cryptographic instructions that were added in
     version 2.07 of the PowerPC ISA.

'-mdirect-move'
'-mno-direct-move'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the instructions to move
     data between the general purpose registers and the vector/scalar
     (VSX) registers that were added in version 2.07 of the PowerPC ISA.

'-mpower8-fusion'
'-mno-power8-fusion'
     Generate code that keeps (does not keeps) some integer operations
     adjacent so that the instructions can be fused together on power8
     and later processors.

'-mpower8-vector'
'-mno-power8-vector'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the vector and scalar
     instructions that were added in version 2.07 of the PowerPC ISA.
     Also enable the use of built-in functions that allow more direct
     access to the vector instructions.

'-mquad-memory'
'-mno-quad-memory'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the non-atomic quad word
     memory instructions.  The '-mquad-memory' option requires use of
     64-bit mode.

'-mquad-memory-atomic'
'-mno-quad-memory-atomic'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the atomic quad word memory
     instructions.  The '-mquad-memory-atomic' option requires use of
     64-bit mode.

'-mfloat-gprs=YES/SINGLE/DOUBLE/NO'
'-mfloat-gprs'
     This switch enables or disables the generation of floating-point
     operations on the general-purpose registers for architectures that
     support it.

     The argument YES or SINGLE enables the use of single-precision
     floating-point operations.

     The argument DOUBLE enables the use of single and double-precision
     floating-point operations.

     The argument NO disables floating-point operations on the
     general-purpose registers.

     This option is currently only available on the MPC854x.

'-m32'
'-m64'
     Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and SVR4
     targets (including GNU/Linux).  The 32-bit environment sets int,
     long and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any
     PowerPC variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and
     long and pointer to 64 bits, and generates code for PowerPC64, as
     for '-mpowerpc64'.

'-mfull-toc'
'-mno-fp-in-toc'
'-mno-sum-in-toc'
'-mminimal-toc'
     Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created
     for every executable file.  The '-mfull-toc' option is selected by
     default.  In that case, GCC allocates at least one TOC entry for
     each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC
     also places floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only
     16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

     If you receive a linker error message that saying you have
     overflowed the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of
     TOC space used with the '-mno-fp-in-toc' and '-mno-sum-in-toc'
     options.  '-mno-fp-in-toc' prevents GCC from putting floating-point
     constants in the TOC and '-mno-sum-in-toc' forces GCC to generate
     code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at run time
     instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one or
     both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
     slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

     If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both
     of these options, specify '-mminimal-toc' instead.  This option
     causes GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When you
     specify this option, GCC produces code that is slower and larger
     but which uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to use
     this option only on files that contain less frequently-executed
     code.

'-maix64'
'-maix32'
     Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit pointers,
     64-bit 'long' type, and the infrastructure needed to support them.
     Specifying '-maix64' implies '-mpowerpc64', while '-maix32'
     disables the 64-bit ABI and implies '-mno-powerpc64'.  GCC defaults
     to '-maix32'.

'-mxl-compat'
'-mno-xl-compat'
     Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler
     semantics when using AIX-compatible ABI.  Pass floating-point
     arguments to prototyped functions beyond the register save area
     (RSA) on the stack in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume
     that most significant double in 128-bit long double value is
     properly rounded when comparing values and converting to double.
     Use XL symbol names for long double support routines.

     The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially
     documented to handle an obscure K&R C case of calling a function
     that takes the address of its arguments with fewer arguments than
     declared.  IBM XL compilers access floating-point arguments that do
     not fit in the RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled
     without optimization.  Because always storing floating-point
     arguments on the stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this
     option is not enabled by default and only is necessary when calling
     subroutines compiled by IBM XL compilers without optimization.

'-mpe'
     Support "IBM RS/6000 SP" "Parallel Environment" (PE).  Link an
     application written to use message passing with special startup
     code to enable the application to run.  The system must have PE
     installed in the standard location ('/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/'), or the
     'specs' file must be overridden with the '-specs=' option to
     specify the appropriate directory location.  The Parallel
     Environment does not support threads, so the '-mpe' option and the
     '-pthread' option are incompatible.

'-malign-natural'
'-malign-power'
     On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the option
     '-malign-natural' overrides the ABI-defined alignment of larger
     types, such as floating-point doubles, on their natural size-based
     boundary.  The option '-malign-power' instructs GCC to follow the
     ABI-specified alignment rules.  GCC defaults to the standard
     alignment defined in the ABI.

     On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and
     '-malign-power' is not supported.

'-msoft-float'
'-mhard-float'
     Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point register
     set.  Software floating-point emulation is provided if you use the
     '-msoft-float' option, and pass the option to GCC when linking.

'-msingle-float'
'-mdouble-float'
     Generate code for single- or double-precision floating-point
     operations.  '-mdouble-float' implies '-msingle-float'.

'-msimple-fpu'
     Do not generate 'sqrt' and 'div' instructions for hardware
     floating-point unit.

'-mfpu=NAME'
     Specify type of floating-point unit.  Valid values for NAME are
     'sp_lite' (equivalent to '-msingle-float -msimple-fpu'), 'dp_lite'
     (equivalent to '-mdouble-float -msimple-fpu'), 'sp_full'
     (equivalent to '-msingle-float'), and 'dp_full' (equivalent to
     '-mdouble-float').

'-mxilinx-fpu'
     Perform optimizations for the floating-point unit on Xilinx PPC
     405/440.

'-mmultiple'
'-mno-multiple'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
     instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
     instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and not
     generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use '-mmultiple' on
     little-endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do not work
     when the processor is in little-endian mode.  The exceptions are
     PPC740 and PPC750 which permit these instructions in little-endian
     mode.

'-mstring'
'-mno-string'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string instructions
     and the store string word instructions to save multiple registers
     and do small block moves.  These instructions are generated by
     default on POWER systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems.  Do
     not use '-mstring' on little-endian PowerPC systems, since those
     instructions do not work when the processor is in little-endian
     mode.  The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit these
     instructions in little-endian mode.

'-mupdate'
'-mno-update'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store
     instructions that update the base register to the address of the
     calculated memory location.  These instructions are generated by
     default.  If you use '-mno-update', there is a small window between
     the time that the stack pointer is updated and the address of the
     previous frame is stored, which means code that walks the stack
     frame across interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.

'-mavoid-indexed-addresses'
'-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses'
     Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of indexed
     load or store instructions.  These instructions can incur a
     performance penalty on Power6 processors in certain situations,
     such as when stepping through large arrays that cross a 16M
     boundary.  This option is enabled by default when targeting Power6
     and disabled otherwise.

'-mfused-madd'
'-mno-fused-madd'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply
     and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by
     default if hardware floating point is used.  The machine-dependent
     '-mfused-madd' option is now mapped to the machine-independent
     '-ffp-contract=fast' option, and '-mno-fused-madd' is mapped to
     '-ffp-contract=off'.

'-mmulhw'
'-mno-mulhw'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply and
     multiply-accumulate instructions on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476
     processors.  These instructions are generated by default when
     targeting those processors.

'-mdlmzb'
'-mno-dlmzb'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search 'dlmzb'
     instruction on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476 processors.  This
     instruction is generated by default when targeting those
     processors.

'-mno-bit-align'
'-mbit-align'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force
     structures and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned to the
     base type of the bit-field.

     For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
     'unsigned' bit-fields of length 1 is aligned to a 4-byte boundary
     and has a size of 4 bytes.  By using '-mno-bit-align', the
     structure is aligned to a 1-byte boundary and is 1 byte in size.

'-mno-strict-align'
'-mstrict-align'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
     unaligned memory references are handled by the system.

'-mrelocatable'
'-mno-relocatable'
     Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static executable to
     be relocated to a different address at run time.  A simple embedded
     PowerPC system loader should relocate the entire contents of
     '.got2' and 4-byte locations listed in the '.fixup' section, a
     table of 32-bit addresses generated by this option.  For this to
     work, all objects linked together must be compiled with
     '-mrelocatable' or '-mrelocatable-lib'.  '-mrelocatable' code
     aligns the stack to an 8-byte boundary.

'-mrelocatable-lib'
'-mno-relocatable-lib'
     Like '-mrelocatable', '-mrelocatable-lib' generates a '.fixup'
     section to allow static executables to be relocated at run time,
     but '-mrelocatable-lib' does not use the smaller stack alignment of
     '-mrelocatable'.  Objects compiled with '-mrelocatable-lib' may be
     linked with objects compiled with any combination of the
     '-mrelocatable' options.

'-mno-toc'
'-mtoc'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume that
     register 2 contains a pointer to a global area pointing to the
     addresses used in the program.

'-mlittle'
'-mlittle-endian'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
     processor in little-endian mode.  The '-mlittle-endian' option is
     the same as '-mlittle'.

'-mbig'
'-mbig-endian'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
     processor in big-endian mode.  The '-mbig-endian' option is the
     same as '-mbig'.

'-mdynamic-no-pic'
     On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is not
     relocatable, but that its external references are relocatable.  The
     resulting code is suitable for applications, but not shared
     libraries.

'-msingle-pic-base'
     Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather
     than loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime
     system is responsible for initializing this register with an
     appropriate value before execution begins.

'-mprioritize-restricted-insns=PRIORITY'
     This option controls the priority that is assigned to dispatch-slot
     restricted instructions during the second scheduling pass.  The
     argument PRIORITY takes the value '0', '1', or '2' to assign no,
     highest, or second-highest (respectively) priority to dispatch-slot
     restricted instructions.

'-msched-costly-dep=DEPENDENCE_TYPE'
     This option controls which dependences are considered costly by the
     target during instruction scheduling.  The argument DEPENDENCE_TYPE
     takes one of the following values:

     'no'
          No dependence is costly.

     'all'
          All dependences are costly.

     'true_store_to_load'
          A true dependence from store to load is costly.

     'store_to_load'
          Any dependence from store to load is costly.

     NUMBER
          Any dependence for which the latency is greater than or equal
          to NUMBER is costly.

'-minsert-sched-nops=SCHEME'
     This option controls which NOP insertion scheme is used during the
     second scheduling pass.  The argument SCHEME takes one of the
     following values:

     'no'
          Don't insert NOPs.

     'pad'
          Pad with NOPs any dispatch group that has vacant issue slots,
          according to the scheduler's grouping.

     'regroup_exact'
          Insert NOPs to force costly dependent insns into separate
          groups.  Insert exactly as many NOPs as needed to force an
          insn to a new group, according to the estimated processor
          grouping.

     NUMBER
          Insert NOPs to force costly dependent insns into separate
          groups.  Insert NUMBER NOPs to force an insn to a new group.

'-mcall-sysv'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using
     calling conventions that adhere to the March 1995 draft of the
     System V Application Binary Interface, PowerPC processor
     supplement.  This is the default unless you configured GCC using
     'powerpc-*-eabiaix'.

'-mcall-sysv-eabi'
'-mcall-eabi'
     Specify both '-mcall-sysv' and '-meabi' options.

'-mcall-sysv-noeabi'
     Specify both '-mcall-sysv' and '-mno-eabi' options.

'-mcall-aixdesc'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the AIX
     operating system.

'-mcall-linux'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
     Linux-based GNU system.

'-mcall-freebsd'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
     FreeBSD operating system.

'-mcall-netbsd'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
     NetBSD operating system.

'-mcall-openbsd'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for the
     OpenBSD operating system.

'-maix-struct-return'
     Return all structures in memory (as specified by the AIX ABI).

'-msvr4-struct-return'
     Return structures smaller than 8 bytes in registers (as specified
     by the SVR4 ABI).

'-mabi=ABI-TYPE'
     Extend the current ABI with a particular extension, or remove such
     extension.  Valid values are ALTIVEC, NO-ALTIVEC, SPE, NO-SPE,
     IBMLONGDOUBLE, IEEELONGDOUBLE, ELFV1, ELFV2.

'-mabi=spe'
     Extend the current ABI with SPE ABI extensions.  This does not
     change the default ABI, instead it adds the SPE ABI extensions to
     the current ABI.

'-mabi=no-spe'
     Disable Book-E SPE ABI extensions for the current ABI.

'-mabi=ibmlongdouble'
     Change the current ABI to use IBM extended-precision long double.
     This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.

'-mabi=ieeelongdouble'
     Change the current ABI to use IEEE extended-precision long double.
     This is a PowerPC 32-bit Linux ABI option.

'-mabi=elfv1'
     Change the current ABI to use the ELFv1 ABI. This is the default
     ABI for big-endian PowerPC 64-bit Linux.  Overriding the default
     ABI requires special system support and is likely to fail in
     spectacular ways.

'-mabi=elfv2'
     Change the current ABI to use the ELFv2 ABI. This is the default
     ABI for little-endian PowerPC 64-bit Linux.  Overriding the default
     ABI requires special system support and is likely to fail in
     spectacular ways.

'-mprototype'
'-mno-prototype'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all calls to
     variable argument functions are properly prototyped.  Otherwise,
     the compiler must insert an instruction before every non-prototyped
     call to set or clear bit 6 of the condition code register (CR) to
     indicate whether floating-point values are passed in the
     floating-point registers in case the function takes variable
     arguments.  With '-mprototype', only calls to prototyped variable
     argument functions set or clear the bit.

'-msim'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
     called 'sim-crt0.o' and that the standard C libraries are
     'libsim.a' and 'libc.a'.  This is the default for
     'powerpc-*-eabisim' configurations.

'-mmvme'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
     called 'crt0.o' and the standard C libraries are 'libmvme.a' and
     'libc.a'.

'-mads'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
     called 'crt0.o' and the standard C libraries are 'libads.a' and
     'libc.a'.

'-myellowknife'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module is
     called 'crt0.o' and the standard C libraries are 'libyk.a' and
     'libc.a'.

'-mvxworks'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, specify that you are
     compiling for a VxWorks system.

'-memb'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, set the PPC_EMB bit in the ELF flags
     header to indicate that 'eabi' extended relocations are used.

'-meabi'
'-mno-eabi'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) adhere to
     the Embedded Applications Binary Interface (EABI), which is a set
     of modifications to the System V.4 specifications.  Selecting
     '-meabi' means that the stack is aligned to an 8-byte boundary, a
     function '__eabi' is called from 'main' to set up the EABI
     environment, and the '-msdata' option can use both 'r2' and 'r13'
     to point to two separate small data areas.  Selecting '-mno-eabi'
     means that the stack is aligned to a 16-byte boundary, no EABI
     initialization function is called from 'main', and the '-msdata'
     option only uses 'r13' to point to a single small data area.  The
     '-meabi' option is on by default if you configured GCC using one of
     the 'powerpc*-*-eabi*' options.

'-msdata=eabi'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small initialized
     'const' global and static data in the '.sdata2' section, which is
     pointed to by register 'r2'.  Put small initialized non-'const'
     global and static data in the '.sdata' section, which is pointed to
     by register 'r13'.  Put small uninitialized global and static data
     in the '.sbss' section, which is adjacent to the '.sdata' section.
     The '-msdata=eabi' option is incompatible with the '-mrelocatable'
     option.  The '-msdata=eabi' option also sets the '-memb' option.

'-msdata=sysv'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global and
     static data in the '.sdata' section, which is pointed to by
     register 'r13'.  Put small uninitialized global and static data in
     the '.sbss' section, which is adjacent to the '.sdata' section.
     The '-msdata=sysv' option is incompatible with the '-mrelocatable'
     option.

'-msdata=default'
'-msdata'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if '-meabi' is used,
     compile code the same as '-msdata=eabi', otherwise compile code the
     same as '-msdata=sysv'.

'-msdata=data'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global data
     in the '.sdata' section.  Put small uninitialized global data in
     the '.sbss' section.  Do not use register 'r13' to address small
     data however.  This is the default behavior unless other '-msdata'
     options are used.

'-msdata=none'
'-mno-sdata'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and static
     data in the '.data' section, and all uninitialized data in the
     '.bss' section.

'-mblock-move-inline-limit=NUM'
     Inline all block moves (such as calls to 'memcpy' or structure
     copies) less than or equal to NUM bytes.  The minimum value for NUM
     is 32 bytes on 32-bit targets and 64 bytes on 64-bit targets.  The
     default value is target-specific.

'-G NUM'
     On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less than
     or equal to NUM bytes into the small data or BSS sections instead
     of the normal data or BSS section.  By default, NUM is 8.  The '-G
     NUM' switch is also passed to the linker.  All modules should be
     compiled with the same '-G NUM' value.

'-mregnames'
'-mno-regnames'
     On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit
     register names in the assembly language output using symbolic
     forms.

'-mlongcall'
'-mno-longcall'
     By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and
     more expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for
     calls farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current
     location.  A short call is generated if the compiler knows the call
     cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by the
     'shortcall' function attribute, or by '#pragma longcall(0)'.

     Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and
     generating glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are
     unnecessary and generate slower code.  As of this writing, the AIX
     linker can do this, as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64.  It is
     planned to add this feature to the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC
     systems as well.

     On Darwin/PPC systems, '#pragma longcall' generates 'jbsr callee,
     L42', plus a "branch island" (glue code).  The two target addresses
     represent the callee and the branch island.  The Darwin/PPC linker
     prefers the first address and generates a 'bl callee' if the PPC
     'bl' instruction reaches the callee directly; otherwise, the linker
     generates 'bl L42' to call the branch island.  The branch island is
     appended to the body of the calling function; it computes the full
     32-bit address of the callee and jumps to it.

     On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit
     to the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides
     whether to use or discard it.

     In the future, GCC may ignore all longcall specifications when the
     linker is known to generate glue.

'-mtls-markers'
'-mno-tls-markers'
     Mark (do not mark) calls to '__tls_get_addr' with a relocation
     specifying the function argument.  The relocation allows the linker
     to reliably associate function call with argument setup
     instructions for TLS optimization, which in turn allows GCC to
     better schedule the sequence.

'-pthread'
     Adds support for multithreading with the "pthreads" library.  This
     option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.

'-mrecip'
'-mno-recip'
     This option enables use of the reciprocal estimate and reciprocal
     square root estimate instructions with additional Newton-Raphson
     steps to increase precision instead of doing a divide or square
     root and divide for floating-point arguments.  You should use the
     '-ffast-math' option when using '-mrecip' (or at least
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations', '-finite-math-only',
     '-freciprocal-math' and '-fno-trapping-math').  Note that while the
     throughput of the sequence is generally higher than the throughput
     of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence
     can be decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals
     0.99999994) for reciprocal square roots.

'-mrecip=OPT'
     This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions may be
     used.  OPT is a comma-separated list of options, which may be
     preceded by a '!' to invert the option: 'all': enable all estimate
     instructions, 'default': enable the default instructions,
     equivalent to '-mrecip', 'none': disable all estimate instructions,
     equivalent to '-mno-recip'; 'div': enable the reciprocal
     approximation instructions for both single and double precision;
     'divf': enable the single-precision reciprocal approximation
     instructions; 'divd': enable the double-precision reciprocal
     approximation instructions; 'rsqrt': enable the reciprocal square
     root approximation instructions for both single and double
     precision; 'rsqrtf': enable the single-precision reciprocal square
     root approximation instructions; 'rsqrtd': enable the
     double-precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions;

     So, for example, '-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd' enables all of the
     reciprocal estimate instructions, except for the 'FRSQRTE',
     'XSRSQRTEDP', and 'XVRSQRTEDP' instructions which handle the
     double-precision reciprocal square root calculations.

'-mrecip-precision'
'-mno-recip-precision'
     Assume (do not assume) that the reciprocal estimate instructions
     provide higher-precision estimates than is mandated by the PowerPC
     ABI. Selecting '-mcpu=power6', '-mcpu=power7' or '-mcpu=power8'
     automatically selects '-mrecip-precision'.  The double-precision
     square root estimate instructions are not generated by default on
     low-precision machines, since they do not provide an estimate that
     converges after three steps.

'-mveclibabi=TYPE'
     Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics using an
     external library.  The only type supported at present is 'mass',
     which specifies to use IBM's Mathematical Acceleration Subsystem
     (MASS) libraries for vectorizing intrinsics using external
     libraries.  GCC currently emits calls to 'acosd2', 'acosf4',
     'acoshd2', 'acoshf4', 'asind2', 'asinf4', 'asinhd2', 'asinhf4',
     'atan2d2', 'atan2f4', 'atand2', 'atanf4', 'atanhd2', 'atanhf4',
     'cbrtd2', 'cbrtf4', 'cosd2', 'cosf4', 'coshd2', 'coshf4', 'erfcd2',
     'erfcf4', 'erfd2', 'erff4', 'exp2d2', 'exp2f4', 'expd2', 'expf4',
     'expm1d2', 'expm1f4', 'hypotd2', 'hypotf4', 'lgammad2', 'lgammaf4',
     'log10d2', 'log10f4', 'log1pd2', 'log1pf4', 'log2d2', 'log2f4',
     'logd2', 'logf4', 'powd2', 'powf4', 'sind2', 'sinf4', 'sinhd2',
     'sinhf4', 'sqrtd2', 'sqrtf4', 'tand2', 'tanf4', 'tanhd2', and
     'tanhf4' when generating code for power7.  Both '-ftree-vectorize'
     and '-funsafe-math-optimizations' must also be enabled.  The MASS
     libraries must be specified at link time.

'-mfriz'
'-mno-friz'
     Generate (do not generate) the 'friz' instruction when the
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations' option is used to optimize rounding
     of floating-point values to 64-bit integer and back to floating
     point.  The 'friz' instruction does not return the same value if
     the floating-point number is too large to fit in an integer.

'-mpointers-to-nested-functions'
'-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions'
     Generate (do not generate) code to load up the static chain
     register (R11) when calling through a pointer on AIX and 64-bit
     Linux systems where a function pointer points to a 3-word
     descriptor giving the function address, TOC value to be loaded in
     register R2, and static chain value to be loaded in register R11.
     The '-mpointers-to-nested-functions' is on by default.  You cannot
     call through pointers to nested functions or pointers to functions
     compiled in other languages that use the static chain if you use
     the '-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions'.

'-msave-toc-indirect'
'-mno-save-toc-indirect'
     Generate (do not generate) code to save the TOC value in the
     reserved stack location in the function prologue if the function
     calls through a pointer on AIX and 64-bit Linux systems.  If the
     TOC value is not saved in the prologue, it is saved just before the
     call through the pointer.  The '-mno-save-toc-indirect' option is
     the default.

'-mcompat-align-parm'
'-mno-compat-align-parm'
     Generate (do not generate) code to pass structure parameters with a
     maximum alignment of 64 bits, for compatibility with older versions
     of GCC.

     Older versions of GCC (prior to 4.9.0) incorrectly did not align a
     structure parameter on a 128-bit boundary when that structure
     contained a member requiring 128-bit alignment.  This is corrected
     in more recent versions of GCC. This option may be used to generate
     code that is compatible with functions compiled with older versions
     of GCC.

     The '-mno-compat-align-parm' option is the default.


File: gcc.info,  Node: RX Options,  Next: S/390 and zSeries Options,  Prev: RS/6000 and PowerPC Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.39 RX Options
------------------

These command-line options are defined for RX targets:

'-m64bit-doubles'
'-m32bit-doubles'
     Make the 'double' data type be 64 bits ('-m64bit-doubles') or 32
     bits ('-m32bit-doubles') in size.  The default is
     '-m32bit-doubles'.  _Note_ RX floating-point hardware only works on
     32-bit values, which is why the default is '-m32bit-doubles'.

'-fpu'
'-nofpu'
     Enables ('-fpu') or disables ('-nofpu') the use of RX
     floating-point hardware.  The default is enabled for the RX600
     series and disabled for the RX200 series.

     Floating-point instructions are only generated for 32-bit
     floating-point values, however, so the FPU hardware is not used for
     doubles if the '-m64bit-doubles' option is used.

     _Note_ If the '-fpu' option is enabled then
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is also enabled automatically.  This
     is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves unsafe.

'-mcpu=NAME'
     Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three types
     are supported, the generic RX600 and RX200 series hardware and the
     specific RX610 CPU. The default is RX600.

     The only difference between RX600 and RX610 is that the RX610 does
     not support the 'MVTIPL' instruction.

     The RX200 series does not have a hardware floating-point unit and
     so '-nofpu' is enabled by default when this type is selected.

'-mbig-endian-data'
'-mlittle-endian-data'
     Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default is
     '-mlittle-endian-data', i.e. to store data in the little-endian
     format.

'-msmall-data-limit=N'
     Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
     which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
     area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
     limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
     not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the
     RX's registers (usually 'r13') is reserved for use pointing to this
     area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
     could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed
     onto the stack instead of being held in this register.

     Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized)
     and constants are not placed into the small data area as they are
     assigned to other sections in the output executable.

     The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
     feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
     ('-O2' etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
     reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
     discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See
     the description of the '-mpid' option for a description of how the
     actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.

'-msim'
'-mno-sim'
     Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss
     board-specific runtime.

'-mas100-syntax'
'-mno-as100-syntax'
     When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible
     with Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by
     the GAS assembler, but it has some restrictions so it is not
     generated by default.

'-mmax-constant-size=N'
     Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be
     used as an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX
     instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to
     be used in instructions, a longer value equates to a longer
     instruction.  Thus in some circumstances it can be beneficial to
     restrict the size of constants that are used in instructions.
     Constants that are too big are instead placed into a constant pool
     and referenced via register indirection.

     The value N can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default) or
     4 means that constants of any size are allowed.

'-mrelax'
     Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby
     the linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding
     shorter versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.

'-mint-register=N'
     Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt
     handler functions.  The value N can be between 0 and 4.  A value of
     1 means that register 'r13' is reserved for the exclusive use of
     fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves 'r13' and 'r12'.  A
     value of 3 reserves 'r13', 'r12' and 'r11', and a value of 4
     reserves 'r13' through 'r10'.  A value of 0, the default, does not
     reserve any registers.

'-msave-acc-in-interrupts'
     Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
     accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might
     use the accumulator register, for example because it performs
     64-bit multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator
     as this makes the interrupt handlers faster.

'-mpid'
'-mno-pid'
     Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled
     any access to constant data is done via an offset from a base
     address held in a register.  This allows the location of constant
     data to be determined at run time without requiring the executable
     to be relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with
     tight memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not
     affected by this option.

     Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually 'r13', for
     the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
     larger code, especially in complicated functions.

     The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
     depends upon whether the '-msmall-data-limit' and/or the
     '-mint-register' command-line options are enabled.  Starting with
     register 'r13' and proceeding downwards, registers are allocated
     first to satisfy the requirements of '-mint-register', then '-mpid'
     and finally '-msmall-data-limit'.  Thus it is possible for the
     small data area register to be 'r8' if both '-mint-register=4' and
     '-mpid' are specified on the command line.

     By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be
     restored via the '-mno-pid' command-line option.

'-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts'
'-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts'
     Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than
     one fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The
     default is to issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler
     found, as the RX only supports one such interrupt.

 _Note:_ The generic GCC command-line option '-ffixed-REG' has special
significance to the RX port when used with the 'interrupt' function
attribute.  This attribute indicates a function intended to process fast
interrupts.  GCC ensures that it only uses the registers 'r10', 'r11',
'r12' and/or 'r13' and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the '-ffixed-REG' or
'-mint-register' command-line options.


File: gcc.info,  Node: S/390 and zSeries Options,  Next: Score Options,  Prev: RX Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.40 S/390 and zSeries Options
---------------------------------

These are the '-m' options defined for the S/390 and zSeries
architecture.

'-mhard-float'
'-msoft-float'
     Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and
     registers for floating-point operations.  When '-msoft-float' is
     specified, functions in 'libgcc.a' are used to perform
     floating-point operations.  When '-mhard-float' is specified, the
     compiler generates IEEE floating-point instructions.  This is the
     default.

'-mhard-dfp'
'-mno-hard-dfp'
     Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point instructions
     for decimal-floating-point operations.  When '-mno-hard-dfp' is
     specified, functions in 'libgcc.a' are used to perform
     decimal-floating-point operations.  When '-mhard-dfp' is specified,
     the compiler generates decimal-floating-point hardware
     instructions.  This is the default for '-march=z9-ec' or higher.

'-mlong-double-64'
'-mlong-double-128'
     These switches control the size of 'long double' type.  A size of
     64 bits makes the 'long double' type equivalent to the 'double'
     type.  This is the default.

'-mbackchain'
'-mno-backchain'
     Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain
     pointer into the callee's stack frame.  A backchain may be needed
     to allow debugging using tools that do not understand DWARF 2 call
     frame information.  When '-mno-packed-stack' is in effect, the
     backchain pointer is stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when
     '-mpacked-stack' is in effect, the backchain is placed into the
     topmost word of the 96/160 byte register save area.

     In general, code compiled with '-mbackchain' is call-compatible
     with code compiled with '-mmo-backchain'; however, use of the
     backchain for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole
     binary is built with '-mbackchain'.  Note that the combination of
     '-mbackchain', '-mpacked-stack' and '-mhard-float' is not
     supported.  In order to build a linux kernel use '-msoft-float'.

     The default is to not maintain the backchain.

'-mpacked-stack'
'-mno-packed-stack'
     Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When '-mno-packed-stack'
     is specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte
     register save area only for their default purpose; unused fields
     still take up stack space.  When '-mpacked-stack' is specified,
     register save slots are densely packed at the top of the register
     save area; unused space is reused for other purposes, allowing for
     more efficient use of the available stack space.  However, when
     '-mbackchain' is also in effect, the topmost word of the save area
     is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
     register is always saved two words below the backchain.

     As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated
     with '-mpacked-stack' is call-compatible with code generated with
     '-mno-packed-stack'.  Note that some non-FSF releases of GCC 2.95
     for S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame
     backchain at run time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code
     is not call-compatible with code compiled with '-mpacked-stack'.
     Also, note that the combination of '-mbackchain', '-mpacked-stack'
     and '-mhard-float' is not supported.  In order to build a linux
     kernel use '-msoft-float'.

     The default is to not use the packed stack layout.

'-msmall-exec'
'-mno-small-exec'
     Generate (or do not generate) code using the 'bras' instruction to
     do subroutine calls.  This only works reliably if the total
     executable size does not exceed 64k.  The default is to use the
     'basr' instruction instead, which does not have this limitation.

'-m64'
'-m31'
     When '-m31' is specified, generate code compliant to the GNU/Linux
     for S/390 ABI.  When '-m64' is specified, generate code compliant
     to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI.  This allows GCC in particular to
     generate 64-bit instructions.  For the 's390' targets, the default
     is '-m31', while the 's390x' targets default to '-m64'.

'-mzarch'
'-mesa'
     When '-mzarch' is specified, generate code using the instructions
     available on z/Architecture.  When '-mesa' is specified, generate
     code using the instructions available on ESA/390.  Note that
     '-mesa' is not possible with '-m64'.  When generating code
     compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI, the default is '-mesa'.
     When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI,
     the default is '-mzarch'.

'-mmvcle'
'-mno-mvcle'
     Generate (or do not generate) code using the 'mvcle' instruction to
     perform block moves.  When '-mno-mvcle' is specified, use a 'mvc'
     loop instead.  This is the default unless optimizing for size.

'-mdebug'
'-mno-debug'
     Print (or do not print) additional debug information when
     compiling.  The default is to not print debug information.

'-march=CPU-TYPE'
     Generate code that runs on CPU-TYPE, which is the name of a system
     representing a certain processor type.  Possible values for
     CPU-TYPE are 'g5', 'g6', 'z900', 'z990', 'z9-109', 'z9-ec' and
     'z10'.  When generating code using the instructions available on
     z/Architecture, the default is '-march=z900'.  Otherwise, the
     default is '-march=g5'.

'-mtune=CPU-TYPE'
     Tune to CPU-TYPE everything applicable about the generated code,
     except for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  The list
     of CPU-TYPE values is the same as for '-march'.  The default is the
     value used for '-march'.

'-mtpf-trace'
'-mno-tpf-trace'
     Generate code that adds (does not add) in TPF OS specific branches
     to trace routines in the operating system.  This option is off by
     default, even when compiling for the TPF OS.

'-mfused-madd'
'-mno-fused-madd'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply
     and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by
     default if hardware floating point is used.

'-mwarn-framesize=FRAMESIZE'
     Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame
     size.  Because this is a compile-time check it doesn't need to be a
     real problem when the program runs.  It is intended to identify
     functions that most probably cause a stack overflow.  It is useful
     to be used in an environment with limited stack size e.g. the linux
     kernel.

'-mwarn-dynamicstack'
     Emit a warning if the function calls 'alloca' or uses
     dynamically-sized arrays.  This is generally a bad idea with a
     limited stack size.

'-mstack-guard=STACK-GUARD'
'-mstack-size=STACK-SIZE'
     If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits additional
     instructions in the function prologue that trigger a trap if the
     stack size is STACK-GUARD bytes above the STACK-SIZE (remember that
     the stack on S/390 grows downward).  If the STACK-GUARD option is
     omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than the frame size of the
     compiled function is chosen.  These options are intended to be used
     to help debugging stack overflow problems.  The additionally
     emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be used
     in production-like systems without greater performance degradation.
     The given values have to be exact powers of 2 and STACK-SIZE has to
     be greater than STACK-GUARD without exceeding 64k.  In order to be
     efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
     at an address aligned to the value given by STACK-SIZE.  The
     STACK-GUARD option can only be used in conjunction with STACK-SIZE.

'-mhotpatch[=HALFWORDS]'
'-mno-hotpatch'
     If the hotpatch option is enabled, a "hot-patching" function
     prologue is generated for all functions in the compilation unit.
     The funtion label is prepended with the given number of two-byte
     Nop instructions (HALFWORDS, maximum 1000000) or 12 Nop
     instructions if no argument is present.  Functions with a
     hot-patching prologue are never inlined automatically, and a
     hot-patching prologue is never generated for functions functions
     that are explicitly inline.

     This option can be overridden for individual functions with the
     'hotpatch' attribute.

     Generate 64-bit code for SHmedia.

'-m5-64media-nofpu'

     Compile code for the processor in big-endian mode.

'-ml'
     Compile code for the processor in little-endian mode.

'-mdalign'
     Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries.  Note that this changes the
     calling conventions, and thus some functions from the standard C
     library do not work unless you recompile it first with '-mdalign'.

'-mrelax'
     Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses
     the linker option '-relax'.

'-mbigtable'
     Use 32-bit offsets in 'switch' tables.  The default is to use
     16-bit offsets.

'-mbitops'
     Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on SH2A.

'-mfmovd'
     Enable the use of the instruction 'fmovd'.  Check '-mdalign' for

'-mrenesas'
     Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.

'-mno-renesas'
     Comply with the calling conventions defined for GCC before the
     Renesas conventions were available.  This option is the default for
     all targets of the SH toolchain.

'-mnomacsave'
     Mark the 'MAC' register as call-clobbered, even if '-mrenesas' is
     given.

'-mieee'
'-mno-ieee'
     Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons, which
     affects the handling of cases where the result of a comparison is
     unordered.  By default '-mieee' is implicitly enabled.  If
     '-ffinite-math-only' is enabled '-mno-ieee' is implicitly set,
     which results in faster floating-point greater-equal and less-equal
     comparisons.  The implcit settings can be overridden by specifying
     either '-mieee' or '-mno-ieee'.

'-minline-ic_invalidate'
     Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after setting
     up nested function trampolines.  This option has no effect if
     '-musermode' is in effect and the selected code generation option
     (e.g.  '-m4') does not allow the use of the 'icbi' instruction.  If
     the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the
     'icbi' instruction, and '-musermode' is not in effect, the inlined
     code manipulates the instruction cache address array directly with
     an associative write.  This not only requires privileged mode at
     run time, but it also fails if the cache line had been mapped via
     the TLB and has become unmapped.

'-misize'
     Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.

'-mpadstruct'
     This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4
     bytes, which is incompatible with the SH ABI.

'-matomic-model=MODEL'
     Sets the model of atomic operations and additional parameters as a
     comma separated list.  For details on the atomic built-in functions
     see *note __atomic Builtins::.  The following models and parameters
     are supported:

     'none'
          Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library
          calls for atomic operations.  This is the default if the
          target is not 'sh*-*-linux*'.

     'soft-gusa'
          Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences
          for the atomic built-in functions.  The generated atomic
          sequences require additional support from the
          interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
          suitable for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option
          is enabled by default when the target is 'sh*-*-linux*' and
          SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is SH4A, this option will also
          partially utilize the hardware atomic instructions 'movli.l'
          and 'movco.l' to create more efficient code, unless 'strict'
          is specified.

     'soft-tcb'
          Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the
          thread control block.  This is a variation of the gUSA
          sequences which can also be used on SH1* and SH2* targets.
          The generated atomic sequences require additional support from
          the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are
          only suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model,
          the 'gbr-offset=' parameter has to be specified as well.

     'soft-imask'
          Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable
          interrupts by setting 'SR.IMASK = 1111'.  This model works
          only when the program runs in privileged mode and is only
          suitable for single-core systems.  Additional support from the
          interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
          required.  This model is enabled by default when the target is
          'sh*-*-linux*' and SH1* or SH2*.

     'hard-llcs'
          Generate hardware atomic sequences using the 'movli.l' and
          'movco.l' instructions only.  This is only available on SH4A
          and is suitable for multi-core systems.  Since the hardware
          instructions support only 32 bit atomic variables access to 8
          or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.  Code
          compiled with this option will also be compatible with other
          software atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if
          executed on an SH4A system.  Additional support from the
          interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
          required for this model.

     'gbr-offset='
          This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable
          in the thread control block structure that should be used by
          the generated atomic sequences when the 'soft-tcb' model has
          been selected.  For other models this parameter is ignored.
          The specified value must be an integer multiple of four and in
          the range 0-1020.

     'strict'
          This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic models,
          even though they would be compatible, and will make the
          compiler generate atomic sequences of the specified model
          only.

'-mtas'
     Generate the 'tas.b' opcode for '__atomic_test_and_set'.  Notice
     that depending on the particular hardware and software
     configuration this can degrade overall performance due to the
     operand cache line flushes that are implied by the 'tas.b'
     instruction.  On multi-core SH4A processors the 'tas.b' instruction
     must be used with caution since it can result in data corruption
     for certain cache configurations.

'-mprefergot'
     When generating position-independent code, emit function calls
     using the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage
     Table.

'-musermode'
'-mno-usermode'
     Don't allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode code.
     Specifying '-musermode' also implies '-mno-inline-ic_invalidate' if
     the inlined code would not work in user mode.  '-musermode' is the
     default when the target is 'sh*-*-linux*'.  If the target is SH1*
     or SH2* '-musermode' has no effect, since there is no user mode.

'-multcost=NUMBER'
     Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.

'-mdiv=STRATEGY'
     Set the division strategy to be used for integer division
     operations.  For SHmedia STRATEGY can be one of:

     'fp'
          Performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very
          high latency, but needs only a few instructions, so it might
          be a good choice if your code has enough easily-exploitable
          ILP to allow the compiler to schedule the floating-point
          instructions together with other instructions.  Division by
          zero causes a floating-point exception.

     'inv'
          Uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the
          divisor, and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.
          This strategy allows CSE and hoisting of the inverse
          calculation.  Division by zero calculates an unspecified
          result, but does not trap.

     'inv:minlat'
          A variant of 'inv' where, if no CSE or hoisting opportunities
          have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted
          to the same place, the last stages of the inverse calculation
          are intertwined with the final multiply to reduce the overall
          latency, at the expense of using a few more instructions, and
          thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with other code.

     'call'
          Calls a library function that usually implements the
          'inv:minlat' strategy.  This gives high code density for
          'm5-*media-nofpu' compilations.

     'call2'
          Uses a different entry point of the same library function,
          where it assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has already
          been set up, which exposes the pointer load to CSE and code
          hoisting optimizations.

     'inv:call'
     'inv:call2'
     'inv:fp'
          Use the 'inv' algorithm for initial code generation, but if
          the code stays unoptimized, revert to the 'call', 'call2', or
          'fp' strategies, respectively.  Note that the
          potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is
          carried by a separate instruction, so it is possible that all
          the integer instructions are hoisted out, but the marker for
          the side effect stays where it is.  A recombination to
          floating-point operations or a call is not possible in that
          case.

     'inv20u'
     'inv20l'
          Variants of the 'inv:minlat' strategy.  In the case that the
          inverse calculation is not separated from the multiply, they
          speed up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus
          sign where applicable) by inserting a test to skip a number of
          operations in this case; this test slows down the case of
          larger dividends.  'inv20u' assumes the case of a such a small
          dividend to be unlikely, and 'inv20l' assumes it to be likely.

     For targets other than SHmedia STRATEGY can be one of:

     'call-div1'
          Calls a library function that uses the single-step division
          instruction 'div1' to perform the operation.  Division by zero
          calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is
          the default except for SH4, SH2A and SHcompact.

     'call-fp'
          Calls a library function that performs the operation in double
          precision floating point.  Division by zero causes a
          floating-point exception.  This is the default for SHcompact
          with FPU. Specifying this for targets that do not have a
          double precision FPU will default to 'call-div1'.

     'call-table'
          Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small
          divisors and the 'div1' instruction with case distinction for
          larger divisors.  Division by zero calculates an unspecified
          result and does not trap.  This is the default for SH4.
          Specifying this for targets that do not have dynamic shift
          instructions will default to 'call-div1'.

     When a division strategy has not been specified the default
     strategy will be selected based on the current target.  For SH2A
     the default strategy is to use the 'divs' and 'divu' instructions
     instead of library function calls.

'-maccumulate-outgoing-args'
     Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue
     rather than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance
     and size.  Also needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack
     frame around conditional code.

'-mdivsi3_libfunc=NAME'
     Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed
     division to NAME.  This only affects the name used in the 'call'
     and 'inv:call' division strategies, and the compiler still expects
     the same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option
     were not present.

'-mfixed-range=REGISTER-RANGE'
     Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
     A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
     specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register
     ranges can be specified separated by a comma.

'-mindexed-addressing'
     Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for
     SHmedia32/SHcompact.  This is only safe if the hardware and/or OS
     implement 32-bit wrap-around semantics for the indexed addressing
     mode.  The architecture allows the implementation of processors
     with 64-bit MMU, which the OS could use to get 32-bit addressing,
     but since no current hardware implementation supports this or any
     other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in the
     32-bit ABI, the default is '-mno-indexed-addressing'.

'-mgettrcost=NUMBER'
     Set the cost assumed for the 'gettr' instruction to NUMBER.  The
     default is 2 if '-mpt-fixed' is in effect, 100 otherwise.

'-mpt-fixed'
     Assume 'pt*' instructions won't trap.  This generally generates
     better-scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.  The
     current architecture definition says that 'ptabs' and 'ptrel' trap
     when the target anded with 3 is 3.  This has the unintentional
     effect of making it unsafe to schedule these instructions before a
     branch, or hoist them out of a loop.  For example,
     '__do_global_ctors', a part of 'libgcc' that runs constructors at
     program startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by
     -1.  With the '-mpt-fixed' option, the 'ptabs' is done before
     testing against -1.  That means that all the constructors run a bit
     more quickly, but when the loop comes to the end of the list, the
     program crashes because 'ptabs' loads -1 into a target register.

     Since this option is unsafe for any hardware implementing the
     current architecture specification, the default is '-mno-pt-fixed'.
     Unless specified explicitly with '-mgettrcost', '-mno-pt-fixed'
     also implies '-mgettrcost=100'; this deters register allocation
     from using target registers for storing ordinary integers.

'-minvalid-symbols'
     Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols
     generated by the compiler are always valid to load with
     'movi'/'shori'/'ptabs' or 'movi'/'shori'/'ptrel', but with
     assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible to generate symbols
     that cause 'ptabs' or 'ptrel' to trap.  This option is only
     meaningful when '-mno-pt-fixed' is in effect.  It prevents
     cross-basic-block CSE, hoisting and most scheduling of symbol
     loads.  The default is '-mno-invalid-symbols'.

'-mbranch-cost=NUM'
     Assume NUM to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers
     make the compiler try to generate more branch-free code if
     possible.  If not specified the value is selected depending on the
     processor type that is being compiled for.

'-mzdcbranch'
'-mno-zdcbranch'
     Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional branch
     instructions 'bt' and 'bf' are fast.  If '-mzdcbranch' is
     specified, the compiler will try to prefer zero displacement branch
     code sequences.  This is enabled by default when generating code
     for SH4 and SH4A. It can be explicitly disabled by specifying
     '-mno-zdcbranch'.

'-mfused-madd'
'-mno-fused-madd'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply
     and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by
     default if hardware floating point is used.  The machine-dependent
     '-mfused-madd' option is now mapped to the machine-independent
     '-ffp-contract=fast' option, and '-mno-fused-madd' is mapped to
     '-ffp-contract=off'.

'-mfsca'
'-mno-fsca'
     Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the 'fsca' instruction for
     sine and cosine approximations.  The option '-mfsca' must be used
     in combination with '-funsafe-math-optimizations'.  It is enabled
     by default when generating code for SH4A. Using '-mno-fsca'
     disables sine and cosine approximations even if
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is in effect.

'-mfsrra'
'-mno-fsrra'
     Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the 'fsrra' instruction for
     reciprocal square root approximations.  The option '-mfsrra' must
     be used in combination with '-funsafe-math-optimizations' and
     '-ffinite-math-only'.  It is enabled by default when generating
     code for SH4A. Using '-mno-fsrra' disables reciprocal square root
     approximations even if '-funsafe-math-optimizations' and
     '-ffinite-math-only' are in effect.

'-mpretend-cmove'
     Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for conditional move
     instruction patterns.  This can result in faster code on the SH4
     processor.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Solaris 2 Options,  Next: SPARC Options,  Prev: SH Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.43 Solaris 2 Options
-------------------------

These '-m' options are supported on Solaris 2:

'-mclear-hwcap'
     '-mclear-hwcap' tells the compiler to remove the hardware
     capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler.  This is only
     necessary when object files use ISA extensions not supported by the
     current machine, but check at runtime whether or not to use them.

'-mimpure-text'
     '-mimpure-text', used in addition to '-shared', tells the compiler
     to not pass '-z text' to the linker when linking a shared object.
     Using this option, you can link position-dependent code into a
     shared object.

     '-mimpure-text' suppresses the "relocations remain against
     allocatable but non-writable sections" linker error message.
     However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
     shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
     using '-mimpure-text', you should compile all source code with
     '-fpic' or '-fPIC'.

 These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:

'-pthreads'
     Add support for multithreading using the POSIX threads library.
     This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.  This
     option does not affect the thread safety of object code produced by
     the compiler or that of libraries supplied with it.

'-pthread'
     This is a synonym for '-pthreads'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: SPARC Options,  Next: SPU Options,  Prev: Solaris 2 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.44 SPARC Options
---------------------

These '-m' options are supported on the SPARC:

'-mno-app-regs'
'-mapp-regs'
     Specify '-mapp-regs' to generate output using the global registers
     2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.
     Like the global register 1, each global register 2 through 4 is
     then treated as an allocable register that is clobbered by function
     calls.  This is the default.

     To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance
     loss, specify '-mno-app-regs'.  You should compile libraries and
     system software with this option.

'-mflat'
'-mno-flat'
     With '-mflat', the compiler does not generate save/restore
     instructions and uses a "flat" or single register window model.
     This model is compatible with the regular register window model.
     The local registers and the input registers (0-5) are still treated
     as "call-saved" registers and are saved on the stack as needed.

     With '-mno-flat' (the default), the compiler generates save/restore
     instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal
     operating mode.

'-mfpu'
'-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This is
     the default.

'-mno-fpu'
'-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler
     are used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.
     You must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded targets
     'sparc-*-aout' and 'sparclite-*-*' do provide software
     floating-point support.

     '-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile _all_ of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile 'libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GCC, with '-msoft-float' in order for this
     to work.

'-mhard-quad-float'
     Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
     instructions.

'-msoft-quad-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
     double) floating-point instructions.  The functions called are
     those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

     As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have
     hardware support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.
     They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and
     then the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.
     Because of the trap handler overhead, this is much slower than
     calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the '-msoft-quad-float'
     option is the default.

'-mno-unaligned-doubles'
'-munaligned-doubles'
     Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the default.

     With '-munaligned-doubles', GCC assumes that doubles have 8-byte
     alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they
     have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4-byte
     alignment.  Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility
     problems with code generated by other compilers.  It is not the
     default because it results in a performance loss, especially for
     floating-point code.

'-muser-mode'
'-mno-user-mode'
     Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.  This is
     relevant only for the 'casa' instruction emitted for the LEON3
     processor.  The default is '-mno-user-mode'.

'-mno-faster-structs'
'-mfaster-structs'
     With '-mfaster-structs', the compiler assumes that structures
     should have 8-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
     'ldd' and 'std' instructions for copies in structure assignment, in
     place of twice as many 'ld' and 'st' pairs.  However, the use of
     this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC ABI.  Thus, it's
     intended only for use on targets where the developer acknowledges
     that their resulting code is not directly in line with the rules of
     the ABI.

'-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  Supported values for
     CPU_TYPE are 'v7', 'cypress', 'v8', 'supersparc', 'hypersparc',
     'leon', 'leon3', 'sparclite', 'f930', 'f934', 'sparclite86x',
     'sparclet', 'tsc701', 'v9', 'ultrasparc', 'ultrasparc3', 'niagara',
     'niagara2', 'niagara3' and 'niagara4'.

     Native Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains also support the value
     'native', which selects the best architecture option for the host
     processor.  '-mcpu=native' has no effect if GCC does not recognize
     the processor.

     Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that
     select an architecture and not an implementation.  These are 'v7',
     'v8', 'sparclite', 'sparclet', 'v9'.

     Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported
     implementations.

     v7
          cypress

     v8
          supersparc, hypersparc, leon, leon3

     sparclite
          f930, f934, sparclite86x

     sparclet
          tsc701

     v9
          ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4

     By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code for
     the V7 variant of the SPARC architecture.  With '-mcpu=cypress',
     the compiler additionally optimizes it for the Cypress CY7C602
     chip, as used in the SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series.  This is
     also appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

     With '-mcpu=v8', GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the SPARC
     architecture.  The only difference from V7 code is that the
     compiler emits the integer multiply and integer divide instructions
     which exist in SPARC-V8 but not in SPARC-V7.  With
     '-mcpu=supersparc', the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
     SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000
     series.

     With '-mcpu=sparclite', GCC generates code for the SPARClite
     variant of the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply,
     integer divide step and scan ('ffs') instructions which exist in
     SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7.  With '-mcpu=f930', the compiler
     additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is
     the original SPARClite, with no FPU.  With '-mcpu=f934', the
     compiler additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip,
     which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.

     With '-mcpu=sparclet', GCC generates code for the SPARClet variant
     of the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer multiply,
     multiply/accumulate, integer divide step and scan ('ffs')
     instructions which exist in SPARClet but not in SPARC-V7.  With
     '-mcpu=tsc701', the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
     TEMIC SPARClet chip.

     With '-mcpu=v9', GCC generates code for the V9 variant of the SPARC
     architecture.  This adds 64-bit integer and floating-point move
     instructions, 3 additional floating-point condition code registers
     and conditional move instructions.  With '-mcpu=ultrasparc', the
     compiler additionally optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi
     chips.  With '-mcpu=ultrasparc3', the compiler additionally
     optimizes it for the Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+
     chips.  With '-mcpu=niagara', the compiler additionally optimizes
     it for Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips.  With '-mcpu=niagara2', the
     compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2 chips.
     With '-mcpu=niagara3', the compiler additionally optimizes it for
     Sun UltraSPARC T3 chips.  With '-mcpu=niagara4', the compiler
     additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips.

'-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
     CPU_TYPE, but do not set the instruction set or register set that
     the option '-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' does.

     The same values for '-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' can be used for
     '-mtune=CPU_TYPE', but the only useful values are those that select
     a particular CPU implementation.  Those are 'cypress',
     'supersparc', 'hypersparc', 'leon', 'leon3', 'f930', 'f934',
     'sparclite86x', 'tsc701', 'ultrasparc', 'ultrasparc3', 'niagara',
     'niagara2', 'niagara3' and 'niagara4'.  With native Solaris and
     GNU/Linux toolchains, 'native' can also be used.

'-mv8plus'
'-mno-v8plus'
     With '-mv8plus', GCC generates code for the SPARC-V8+ ABI.  The
     difference from the V8 ABI is that the global and out registers are
     considered 64 bits wide.  This is enabled by default on Solaris in
     32-bit mode for all SPARC-V9 processors.

'-mvis'
'-mno-vis'
     With '-mvis', GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
     UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions.  The default is
     '-mno-vis'.

'-mvis2'
'-mno-vis2'
     With '-mvis2', GCC generates code that takes advantage of version
     2.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions.  The
     default is '-mvis2' when targeting a cpu that supports such
     instructions, such as UltraSPARC-III and later.  Setting '-mvis2'
     also sets '-mvis'.

'-mvis3'
'-mno-vis3'
     With '-mvis3', GCC generates code that takes advantage of version
     3.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions.  The
     default is '-mvis3' when targeting a cpu that supports such
     instructions, such as niagara-3 and later.  Setting '-mvis3' also
     sets '-mvis2' and '-mvis'.

'-mcbcond'
'-mno-cbcond'
     With '-mcbcond', GCC generates code that takes advantage of
     compare-and-branch instructions, as defined in the Sparc
     Architecture 2011.  The default is '-mcbcond' when targeting a cpu
     that supports such instructions, such as niagara-4 and later.

'-mpopc'
'-mno-popc'
     With '-mpopc', GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
     UltraSPARC population count instruction.  The default is '-mpopc'
     when targeting a cpu that supports such instructions, such as
     Niagara-2 and later.

'-mfmaf'
'-mno-fmaf'
     With '-mfmaf', GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
     UltraSPARC Fused Multiply-Add Floating-point extensions.  The
     default is '-mfmaf' when targeting a cpu that supports such
     instructions, such as Niagara-3 and later.

'-mfix-at697f'
     Enable the documented workaround for the single erratum of the
     Atmel AT697F processor (which corresponds to erratum #13 of the
     AT697E processor).

'-mfix-ut699'
     Enable the documented workarounds for the floating-point errata and
     the data cache nullify errata of the UT699 processor.

 These '-m' options are supported in addition to the above on SPARC-V9
processors in 64-bit environments:

'-m32'
'-m64'
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit
     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

'-mcmodel=WHICH'
     Set the code model to one of

     'medlow'
          The Medium/Low code model: 64-bit addresses, programs must be
          linked in the low 32 bits of memory.  Programs can be
          statically or dynamically linked.

     'medmid'
          The Medium/Middle code model: 64-bit addresses, programs must
          be linked in the low 44 bits of memory, the text and data
          segments must be less than 2GB in size and the data segment
          must be located within 2GB of the text segment.

     'medany'
          The Medium/Anywhere code model: 64-bit addresses, programs may
          be linked anywhere in memory, the text and data segments must
          be less than 2GB in size and the data segment must be located
          within 2GB of the text segment.

     'embmedany'
          The Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems: 64-bit
          addresses, the text and data segments must be less than 2GB in
          size, both starting anywhere in memory (determined at link
          time).  The global register %g4 points to the base of the data
          segment.  Programs are statically linked and PIC is not
          supported.

'-mmemory-model=MEM-MODEL'
     Set the memory model in force on the processor to one of

     'default'
          The default memory model for the processor and operating
          system.

     'rmo'

     'tso'
          Total Store Order

          Sequential Consistency

     These memory models are formally defined in Appendix D of the Sparc
     V9 architecture manual, as set in the processor's 'PSTATE.MM'
     field.

'-mstack-bias'
'-mno-stack-bias'
     With '-mstack-bias', GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and frame
     pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back
     when making stack frame references.  This is the default in 64-bit
     mode.  Otherwise, assume no such offset is present.


File: gcc.info,  Node: SPU Options,  Next: System V Options,  Prev: SPARC Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.45 SPU Options
-------------------

These '-m' options are supported on the SPU:

'-mwarn-reloc'
'-merror-reloc'

     The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations.  By
     default, GCC gives an error when it generates code that requires a
     dynamic relocation.  '-mno-error-reloc' disables the error,
     '-mwarn-reloc' generates a warning instead.

'-msafe-dma'
'-munsafe-dma'

     Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must not be
     reordered with respect to loads and stores of the memory that is
     being accessed.  With '-munsafe-dma' you must use the 'volatile'
     keyword to protect memory accesses, but that can lead to
     inefficient code in places where the memory is known to not change.
     Rather than mark the memory as volatile, you can use '-msafe-dma'
     to tell the compiler to treat the DMA instructions as potentially
     affecting all memory.

'-mbranch-hints'

     By default, GCC generates a branch hint instruction to avoid
     pipeline stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches.  A
     hint is not generated closer than 8 instructions away from its
     branch.  There is little reason to disable them, except for
     debugging purposes, or to make an object a little bit smaller.

'-msmall-mem'
'-mlarge-mem'

     By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are never
     larger than 18 bits.  With '-mlarge-mem' code is generated that
     assumes a full 32-bit address.

'-mstdmain'

     By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the
     SPU-style main function interface (which has an unconventional
     parameter list).  With '-mstdmain', GCC links your program against
     startup code that assumes a C99-style interface to 'main',
     including a local copy of 'argv' strings.

'-mfixed-range=REGISTER-RANGE'
     Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
     A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.
     This is useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is
     specified as two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register
     ranges can be specified separated by a comma.

'-mea32'
'-mea64'
     Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space
     accessed via the '__ea' named address space qualifier are either 32
     or 64 bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this is an
     ABI-changing option, all object code in an executable must be
     compiled with the same setting.

'-maddress-space-conversion'
'-mno-address-space-conversion'
     Allow/disallow treating the '__ea' address space as superset of the
     generic address space.  This enables explicit type casts between
     '__ea' and generic pointer as well as implicit conversions of
     generic pointers to '__ea' pointers.  The default is to allow
     address space pointer conversions.

'-mcache-size=CACHE-SIZE'
     This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links
     to an executable and selects a software-managed cache for accessing
     variables in the '__ea' address space with a particular cache size.
     Possible options for CACHE-SIZE are '8', '16', '32', '64' and
     '128'.  The default cache size is 64KB.

'-matomic-updates'
'-mno-atomic-updates'
     This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links
     to an executable and selects whether atomic updates to the
     software-managed cache of PPU-side variables are used.  If you use
     atomic updates, changes to a PPU variable from SPU code using the
     '__ea' named address space qualifier do not interfere with changes
     to other PPU variables residing in the same cache line from PPU
     code.  If you do not use atomic updates, such interference may
     occur; however, writing back cache lines is more efficient.  The
     default behavior is to use atomic updates.

'-mdual-nops'
'-mdual-nops=N'
     By default, GCC inserts nops to increase dual issue when it expects
     it to increase performance.  N can be a value from 0 to 10.  A
     smaller N inserts fewer nops.  10 is the default, 0 is the same as
     '-mno-dual-nops'.  Disabled with '-Os'.

'-mhint-max-nops=N'
     Maximum number of nops to insert for a branch hint.  A branch hint
     must be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it is
     affecting.  GCC inserts up to N nops to enforce this, otherwise it
     does not generate the branch hint.

'-mhint-max-distance=N'
     The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint to be
     within 256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.  By default,
     GCC makes sure it is within 125.

'-msafe-hints'
     Work around a hardware bug that causes the SPU to stall
     indefinitely.  By default, GCC inserts the 'hbrp' instruction to
     make sure this stall won't happen.

3.17.46 Options for System V
----------------------------

These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
compatibility with other compilers on those systems:

'-G'
     Create a shared object.  It is recommended that '-symbolic' or
     '-shared' be used instead.

'-Qy'
     Identify the versions of each tool used by the compiler, in a
     '.ident' assembler directive in the output.

'-Qn'
     Refrain from adding '.ident' directives to the output file (this is
     the default).

'-YP,DIRS'
     Search the directories DIRS, and no others, for libraries specified
     with '-l'.

'-Ym,DIR'
     Look in the directory DIR to find the M4 preprocessor.  The
     assembler uses this option.


File: gcc.info,  Node: TILE-Gx Options,  Next: TILEPro Options,  Prev: System V Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.47 TILE-Gx Options
-----------------------

These '-m' options are supported on the TILE-Gx:

'-mcmodel=small'
     Generate code for the small model.  The distance for direct calls
     is limited to 500M in either direction.  PC-relative addresses are
     32 bits.  Absolute addresses support the full address range.

'-mcmodel=large'
     Generate code for the large model.  There is no limitation on call
     distance, pc-relative addresses, or absolute addresses.

'-mcpu=NAME'
     Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only
     supported type is 'tilegx'.

'-m32'
'-m64'
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
     environment sets int, long, and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit
     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

'-mbig-endian'
'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code in big/little endian mode, respectively.

3.17.48 TILEPro Options
-----------------------

These '-m' options are supported on the TILEPro:

'-mcpu=NAME'
     Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only
     supported type is 'tilepro'.

'-m32'
     Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int, long, and
     pointer to 32 bits.  This is the only supported behavior so the
     flag is essentially ignored.


File: gcc.info,  Node: V850 Options,  Next: VAX Options,  Prev: TILEPro Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.49 V850 Options
--------------------

These '-m' options are defined for V850 implementations:

'-mlong-calls'
'-mno-long-calls'
     Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to
     be far away, the compiler always loads the function's address into
     a register, and calls indirect through the pointer.

'-mno-ep'
'-mep'
     Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index
     pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the 'ep' register, and
     use the shorter 'sld' and 'sst' instructions.  The '-mep' option is
     on by default if you optimize.

'-mno-prolog-function'
'-mprolog-function'
     Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore
     registers at the prologue and epilogue of a function.  The external
     functions are slower, but use less code space if more than one
     function saves the same number of registers.  The
     '-mprolog-function' option is on by default if you optimize.

'-mspace'
     Try to make the code as small as possible.  At present, this just
     turns on the '-mep' and '-mprolog-function' options.

'-mtda=N'
     Put static or global variables whose size is N bytes or less into
     the tiny data area that register 'ep' points to.  The tiny data
     area can hold up to 256 bytes in total (128 bytes for byte
     references).

'-msda=N'
     Put static or global variables whose size is N bytes or less into
     the small data area that register 'gp' points to.  The small data
     area can hold up to 64 kilobytes.

'-mzda=N'
     Put static or global variables whose size is N bytes or less into
     the first 32 kilobytes of memory.

'-mv850'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850.

'-mv850e3v5'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850E3V5.  The
     preprocessor constant '__v850e3v5__' is defined if this option is
     used.

'-mv850e2v4'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850E3V5.  This is an
     alias for the '-mv850e3v5' option.

'-mv850e2v3'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850E2V3.  The
     preprocessor constant '__v850e2v3__' is defined if this option is
     used.

'-mv850e2'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850E2.  The preprocessor
     constant '__v850e2__' is defined if this option is used.

'-mv850e1'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850E1.  The preprocessor
     constants '__v850e1__' and '__v850e__' are defined if this option
     is used.

'-mv850es'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850ES. This is an alias
     for the '-mv850e1' option.

'-mv850e'
     Specify that the target processor is the V850E.  The preprocessor
     constant '__v850e__' is defined if this option is used.

     If neither '-mv850' nor '-mv850e' nor '-mv850e1' nor '-mv850e2' nor
     '-mv850e2v3' nor '-mv850e3v5' are defined then a default target
     processor is chosen and the relevant '__v850*__' preprocessor
     constant is defined.

     The preprocessor constants '__v850' and '__v851__' are always
     defined, regardless of which processor variant is the target.

'-mdisable-callt'
'-mno-disable-callt'
     This option suppresses generation of the 'CALLT' instruction for
     the v850e, v850e1, v850e2, v850e2v3 and v850e3v5 flavors of the
     v850 architecture.

     This option is enabled by default when the RH850 ABI is in use (see
     '-mrh850-abi'), and disabled by default when the GCC ABI is in use.
     If 'CALLT' instructions are being generated then the C preprocessor
     symbol '__V850_CALLT__' will be defined.

'-mrelax'
'-mno-relax'
     Pass on (or do not pass on) the '-mrelax' command line option to
     the assembler.

'-mlong-jumps'
'-mno-long-jumps'
     Disable (or re-enable) the generation of PC-relative jump
     instructions.

'-msoft-float'
'-mhard-float'
     Disable (or re-enable) the generation of hardware floating point
     instructions.  This option is only significant when the target
     architecture is 'V850E2V3' or higher.  If hardware floating point
     instructions are being generated then the C preprocessor symbol
     '__FPU_OK__' will be defined, otherwise the symbol '__NO_FPU__'
     will be defined.

'-mloop'
     Enables the use of the e3v5 LOOP instruction.  The use of this
     instruction is not enabled by default when the e3v5 architecture is
     selected because its use is still experimental.

'-mrh850-abi'
'-mghs'
     Enables support for the RH850 version of the V850 ABI. This is the
     default.  With this version of the ABI the following rules apply:

        * Integer sized structures and unions are returned via a memory
          pointer rather than a register.

        * Large structures and unions (more than 8 bytes in size) are
          passed by value.

        * Functions are aligned to 16-bit boundaries.

        * The '-m8byte-align' command line option is supported.

        * The '-mdisable-callt' command line option is enabled by
          default.  The '-mno-disable-callt' command line option is not
          supported.

     When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol
     '__V850_RH850_ABI__' is defined.

'-mgcc-abi'
     Enables support for the old GCC version of the V850 ABI. With this
     version of the ABI the following rules apply:

        * Integer sized structures and unions are returned in register
          'r10'.

        * Large structures and unions (more than 8 bytes in size) are
          passed by reference.

        * Functions are aligned to 32-bit boundaries, unless optimizing
          for size.

        * The '-m8byte-align' command line option is not supported.

        * The '-mdisable-callt' command line option is supported but not
          enabled by default.

     When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol
     '__V850_GCC_ABI__' is defined.

'-m8byte-align'
'-mno-8byte-align'
     Enables support for 'doubles' and 'long long' types to be aligned
     on 8-byte boundaries.  The default is to restrict the alignment of
     all objects to at most 4-bytes.  When '-m8byte-align' is in effect
     the C preprocessor symbol '__V850_8BYTE_ALIGN__' will be defined.

'-mbig-switch'
     Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only
     if the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within
     a switch table.

'-mapp-regs'
     This option causes r2 and r5 to be used in the code generated by
     the compiler.  This setting is the default.

'-mno-app-regs'
     This option causes r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed registers.

'-mdebug-main=PREFIX'
     Flag the first routine whose name starts with PREFIX as the main
     routine for the debugger.

'-mmalloc64'
     Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.

'-mpointer-size=SIZE'
     Set the default size of pointers.  Possible options for SIZE are
     '32' or 'short' for 32 bit pointers, '64' or 'long' for 64 bit
     pointers, and 'no' for supporting only 32 bit pointers.  The later
     option disables 'pragma pointer_size'.

3.17.52 VxWorks Options
-----------------------

The options in this section are defined for all VxWorks targets.
Options specific to the target hardware are listed with the other
options for that target.

'-mrtp'
     GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time
     processes (RTPs).  This option switches from the former to the
     latter.  It also defines the preprocessor macro '__RTP__'.

'-non-static'
     Link an RTP executable against shared libraries rather than static
     libraries.  The options '-static' and '-shared' can also be used
     for RTPs (*note Link Options::); '-static' is the default.

'-Bstatic'
'-Bdynamic'
     These options are passed down to the linker.  They are defined for
     compatibility with Diab.

'-Xbind-lazy'
     Enable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is equivalent
     to '-Wl,-z,now' and is defined for compatibility with Diab.

'-Xbind-now'
     Disable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is the default
     and is defined for compatibility with Diab.

     Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Xtensa Options,  Next: zSeries Options,  Prev: Xstormy16 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

3.17.55 Xtensa Options
----------------------

These options are supported for Xtensa targets:

'-mconst16'
'-mno-const16'
     Enable or disable use of 'CONST16' instructions for loading
     constant values.  The 'CONST16' instruction is currently not a
     standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, 'CONST16'
     instructions are always used in place of the standard 'L32R'
     instructions.  The use of 'CONST16' is enabled by default only if
     the 'L32R' instruction is not available.

'-mfused-madd'
'-mno-fused-madd'
     Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
     instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if
     the floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused
     multiply/add and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler
     to use separate instructions for the multiply and add/subtract
     operations.  This may be desirable in some cases where strict IEEE
     754-compliant results are required: the fused multiply add/subtract
     instructions do not round the intermediate result, thereby
     producing results with _more_ bits of precision than specified by
     the IEEE standard.  Disabling fused multiply add/subtract
     instructions also ensures that the program output is not sensitive
     to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
     operations.

'-mserialize-volatile'
'-mno-serialize-volatile'
     When this option is enabled, GCC inserts 'MEMW' instructions before
     'volatile' memory references to guarantee sequential consistency.
     The default is '-mserialize-volatile'.  Use
     '-mno-serialize-volatile' to omit the 'MEMW' instructions.

'-mforce-no-pic'
     For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must
     be position-independent code (PIC), this option disables PIC for
     compiling kernel code.

'-mtext-section-literals'
'-mno-text-section-literals'
     Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
     '-mno-text-section-literals', which places literals in a separate
     section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
     placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine
     literal pools from separate object files to remove redundant
     literals and improve code size.  With '-mtext-section-literals',
     the literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep
     them as close as possible to their references.  This may be
     necessary for large assembly files.

'-mtarget-align'
'-mno-target-align'
     When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
     automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
     expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen
     density instructions to align branch targets and the instructions
     following call instructions.  If there are not enough preceding
     safe density instructions to align a target, no widening is
     performed.  The default is '-mtarget-align'.  These options do not
     affect the treatment of auto-aligned instructions like 'LOOP',
     which the assembler always aligns, either by widening density
     instructions or by inserting NOP instructions.

'-mlongcalls'
'-mno-longcalls'
     When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
     translate direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine
     that the target of a direct call is in the range allowed by the
     call instruction.  This translation typically occurs for calls to
     functions in other source files.  Specifically, the assembler
     translates a direct 'CALL' instruction into an 'L32R' followed by a
     'CALLX' instruction.  The default is '-mno-longcalls'.  This option
     should be used in programs where the call target can potentially be
     out of range.  This option is implemented in the assembler, not the
     compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC still shows direct
     call instructions--look at the disassembled object code to see the
     actual instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call
     for every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of
     range.

3.18 Options for Code Generation Conventions
============================================

These machine-independent options control the interface conventions used
in code generation.

 Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of '-ffoo' is '-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms is
listed--the one that is not the default.  You can figure out the other
form by either removing 'no-' or adding it.

'-fbounds-check'
     For front ends that support it, generate additional code to check
     that indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.
     This is currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front
     ends, where this option defaults to true and false respectively.

'-fstack-reuse=REUSE-LEVEL'
     This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto
     variables and compiler generated temporaries.  REUSE_LEVEL can be
     'all', 'named_vars', or 'none'.  'all' enables stack reuse for all
     local variables and temporaries, 'named_vars' enables the reuse
     only for user defined local variables with names, and 'none'
     disables stack reuse completely.  The default value is 'all'.  The
     option is needed when the program extends the lifetime of a scoped
     local variable or a compiler generated temporary beyond the end
     point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of a variable ends,
     and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has
     the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or
     scoped local variables whose live range does not overlap with it.
     Legacy code extending local lifetime will likely to break with the
     stack reuse optimization.

     For example,

             int *p;
             {
               int local1;

               p = &local1;
               local1 = 10;
               ....
             }
             {
                int local2;
                local2 = 20;
                ...
             }

             if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
               {

               }

     Another example:

             struct A
             {
                 A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
                 int i;
                 int j;
             };

             A *ap;

             void foo(const A& ar)
             {
                ap = &ar;
             }

             void bar()
             {
                foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns

                {
                  A a(20);
                  ....
                }
                ap->i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                             // is reused with a. What is the value of ap->i?
             }


     The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by
     the C++ standard.  When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the
     temporary lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom
     to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped local
     variables whose live range does not overlap with it.  However some
     of the legacy code relies on the behavior of older compilers in
     which temporaries' stack space is not reused, the aggressive stack
     reuse can lead to runtime errors.  This option is used to control
     the temporary stack reuse optimization.

'-ftrapv'
     This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition,
     subtraction, multiplication operations.

'-fwrapv'
     This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
     overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
     using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some
     optimizations and disables others.  This option is enabled by
     default for the Java front end, as required by the Java language
     specification.

'-fexceptions'
     Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to
     propagate exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC generates
     frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce
     significant data size overhead, although it does not affect
     execution.  If you do not specify this option, GCC enables it by
     default for languages like C++ that normally require exception
     handling, and disables it for languages like C that do not normally
     require it.  However, you may need to enable this option when
     compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception
     handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to disable this option
     if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't use exception
     handling.

'-fnon-call-exceptions'
     Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw
     exceptions.  Note that this requires platform-specific runtime
     support that does not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows
     _trapping_ instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references
     or floating-point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be
     thrown from arbitrary signal handlers such as 'SIGALRM'.

'-fdelete-dead-exceptions'
     Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't
     otherwise contribute to the execution of the program can be
     optimized away.  This option is enabled by default for the Ada
     front end, as permitted by the Ada language specification.
     Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are
     enabled independently at different optimization levels.

'-funwind-tables'
     Similar to '-fexceptions', except that it just generates any needed
     static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other
     way.  You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a
     language processor that needs this handling enables it on your
     behalf.

'-fasynchronous-unwind-tables'
     Generate unwind table in DWARF 2 format, if supported by target
     machine.  The table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it
     can be used for stack unwinding from asynchronous events (such as
     debugger or garbage collector).

'-fno-gnu-unique'
     On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++
     compiler uses the 'STB_GNU_UNIQUE' binding to make sure that
     definitions of template static data members and static local
     variables in inline functions are unique even in the presence of
     'RTLD_LOCAL'; this is necessary to avoid problems with a library
     used by two different 'RTLD_LOCAL' plugins depending on a
     definition in one of them and therefore disagreeing with the other
     one about the binding of the symbol.  But this causes 'dlclose' to
     be ignored for affected DSOs; if your program relies on
     reinitialization of a DSO via 'dlclose' and 'dlopen', you can use
     '-fno-gnu-unique'.

'-fpcc-struct-return'
     Return "short" 'struct' and 'union' values in memory like longer
     ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less efficient,
     but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
     GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers,
     particularly the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

     The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
     on the target configuration macros.

     Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment
     match that of some integer type.

     *Warning:* code compiled with the '-fpcc-struct-return' switch is
     not binary compatible with code compiled with the
     '-freg-struct-return' switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default
     application binary interface.

'-freg-struct-return'
     Return 'struct' and 'union' values in registers when possible.
     This is more efficient for small structures than
     '-fpcc-struct-return'.

     If you specify neither '-fpcc-struct-return' nor
     '-freg-struct-return', GCC defaults to whichever convention is
     standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
     defaults to '-fpcc-struct-return', except on targets where GCC is
     the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the
     standard, and we chose the more efficient register return
     alternative.

     *Warning:* code compiled with the '-freg-struct-return' switch is
     not binary compatible with code compiled with the
     '-fpcc-struct-return' switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default
     application binary interface.

'-fshort-enums'
     Allocate to an 'enum' type only as many bytes as it needs for the
     declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the 'enum' type
     is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.

     *Warning:* the '-fshort-enums' switch causes GCC to generate code
     that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
     switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
     interface.

'-fshort-double'
     Use the same size for 'double' as for 'float'.

     *Warning:* the '-fshort-double' switch causes GCC to generate code
     that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
     switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
     interface.

'-fshort-wchar'
     Override the underlying type for 'wchar_t' to be 'short unsigned
     int' instead of the default for the target.  This option is useful
     for building programs to run under WINE.

     *Warning:* the '-fshort-wchar' switch causes GCC to generate code
     that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
     switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
     interface.

'-fno-common'
     In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global
     variables.  Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple
     definitions of such variables in different compilation units by
     placing the variables in a common block.  This is the behavior
     specified by '-fcommon', and is the default for GCC on most
     targets.  On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO
     C, and on some targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on
     variable references.  The '-fno-common' option specifies that the
     compiler should place uninitialized global variables in the data
     section of the object file, rather than generating them as common
     blocks.  This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
     (without 'extern') in two different compilations, you get a
     multiple-definition error when you link them.  In this case, you
     must compile with '-fcommon' instead.  Compiling with '-fno-common'
     is useful on targets for which it provides better performance, or
     if you wish to verify that the program will work on other systems
     that always treat uninitialized variable declarations this way.

'-fno-ident'
     Ignore the '#ident' directive.

'-finhibit-size-directive'
     Don't output a '.size' assembler directive, or anything else that
     would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
     two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This
     option is used when compiling 'crtstuff.c'; you should not need to
     use it for anything else.

'-fverbose-asm'
     Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
     make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to
     those who actually need to read the generated assembly code
     (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).

     '-fno-verbose-asm', the default, causes the extra information to be
     omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler files.

'-frecord-gcc-switches'
     This switch causes the command line used to invoke the compiler to
     be recorded into the object file that is being created.  This
     switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format of
     the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
     usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
     switch is related to the '-fverbose-asm' switch, but that switch
     only records information in the assembler output file as comments,
     so it never reaches the object file.  See also
     '-grecord-gcc-switches' for another way of storing compiler options
     into the object file.

'-fpic'
     Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a
     shared library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code
     accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table
     (GOT).  The dynamic loader resolves the GOT entries when the
     program starts (the dynamic loader is not part of GCC; it is part
     of the operating system).  If the GOT size for the linked
     executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum size, you get an
     error message from the linker indicating that '-fpic' does not
     work; in that case, recompile with '-fPIC' instead.  (These
     maximums are 8k on the SPARC and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The
     386 has no such limit.)

     Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
     works only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for
     System V but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM
     RS/6000 is always position-independent.

     When this flag is set, the macros '__pic__' and '__PIC__' are
     defined to 1.

'-fPIC'
     If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent
     code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the
     size of the global offset table.  This option makes a difference on
     the m68k, PowerPC and SPARC.

     Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
     works only on certain machines.

     When this flag is set, the macros '__pic__' and '__PIC__' are
     defined to 2.

'-fpie'
'-fPIE'
     These options are similar to '-fpic' and '-fPIC', but generated
     position independent code can be only linked into executables.
     Usually these options are used when '-pie' GCC option is used
     during linking.

     '-fpie' and '-fPIE' both define the macros '__pie__' and '__PIE__'.
     The macros have the value 1 for '-fpie' and 2 for '-fPIE'.

'-fno-jump-tables'
     Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
     more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option
     is of use in conjunction with '-fpic' or '-fPIC' for building code
     that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot reference the
     address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables do not
     require a GOT and this option is not needed.

'-ffixed-REG'
     Treat the register named REG as a fixed register; generated code
     should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
     pointer or in some other fixed role).

     REG must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
     are machine-specific and are defined in the 'REGISTER_NAMES' macro
     in the machine description macro file.

     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
     three-way choice.

'-fcall-used-REG'
     Treat the register named REG as an allocable register that is
     clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries
     or variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled
     this way do not save and restore the register REG.

     It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack
     pointer.  Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed
     pervasive roles in the machine's execution model produces
     disastrous results.

     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
     three-way choice.

'-fcall-saved-REG'
     Treat the register named REG as an allocable register saved by
     functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables
     that live across a call.  Functions compiled this way save and
     restore the register REG if they use it.

     It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack
     pointer.  Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed
     pervasive roles in the machine's execution model produces
     disastrous results.

     A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for
     a register in which function values may be returned.

     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
     three-way choice.

'-fpack-struct[=N]'
     Without a value specified, pack all structure members together
     without holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small
     power of two), pack structure members according to this value,
     representing the maximum alignment (that is, objects with default
     alignment requirements larger than this are output potentially
     unaligned at the next fitting location.

     *Warning:* the '-fpack-struct' switch causes GCC to generate code
     that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
     switch.  Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.  Use it to
     conform to a non-default application binary interface.

'-finstrument-functions'
     Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.
     Just after function entry and just before function exit, the
     following profiling functions are called with the address of the
     current function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
     '__builtin_return_address' does not work beyond the current
     function, so the call site information may not be available to the
     profiling functions otherwise.)

          void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
          void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);

     The first argument is the address of the start of the current
     function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

     This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in
     other functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually,
     the inline function is entered and exited.  This means that
     addressable versions of such functions must be available.  If all
     your uses of a function are expanded inline, this may mean an
     additional expansion of code size.  If you use 'extern inline' in
     your C code, an addressable version of such functions must be
     provided.  (This is normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky
     and the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you might
     have gotten away without providing static copies.)

     A function may be given the attribute 'no_instrument_function', in
     which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
     example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
     interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling
     functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the
     profiling routines generate output or allocate memory).

'-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=FILE,FILE,...'

     Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation
     (see the description of '-finstrument-functions').  If the file
     that contains a function definition matches with one of FILE, then
     that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on
     substrings: if the FILE parameter is a substring of the file name,
     it is considered to be a match.

     For example:

          -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys

     excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
     contain '/bits/stl' or 'include/sys'.

     If, for some reason, you want to include letter '','' in one of
     SYM, write ''\,''.  For example,
     '-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list='\,\,tmp'' (note the
     single quote surrounding the option).

'-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=SYM,SYM,...'

     This is similar to '-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list', but
     this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
     instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its
     user-visible name, such as 'vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)',
     not the internal mangled name (e.g., '_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE').
     The match is done on substrings: if the SYM parameter is a
     substring of the function name, it is considered to be a match.
     For C99 and C++ extended identifiers, the function name must be
     given in UTF-8, not using universal character names.

'-fstack-check'
     Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of
     the stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
     environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to
     specify it in a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is
     automatically detected on nearly all systems if there is only one
     stack.

     Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done;
     the operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The
     switch causes generation of code to ensure that they see the stack
     being extended.

     You can additionally specify a string parameter: 'no' means no
     checking, 'generic' means force the use of old-style checking,
     'specific' means use the best checking method and is equivalent to
     bare '-fstack-check'.

     Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
     target support in the compiler but comes with the following
     drawbacks:

       1. Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are
          always allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed
          threshold.

       2. Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when
          it is topped by a particular function, stack checking is not
          reliable and a warning is issued by the compiler.

       3. Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy
          and the generic implementation, code performance is hampered.

     Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
     'specific' if no target support has been added in the compiler.

'-fstack-limit-register=REG'
'-fstack-limit-symbol=SYM'
'-fno-stack-limit'
     Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a
     certain value, either the value of a register or the address of a
     symbol.  If a larger stack is required, a signal is raised at run
     time.  For most targets, the signal is raised before the stack
     overruns the boundary, so it is possible to catch the signal
     without taking special precautions.

     For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address '0x80000000'
     and grows downwards, you can use the flags
     '-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit' and
     '-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000' to enforce a stack limit of
     128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.

'-fsplit-stack'
     Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
     The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
     overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.
     This is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no
     longer necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each
     thread.  This is currently only implemented for the i386 and x86_64
     back ends running GNU/Linux.

     When code compiled with '-fsplit-stack' calls code compiled without
     '-fsplit-stack', there may not be much stack space available for
     the latter code to run.  If compiling all code, including library
     code, with '-fsplit-stack' is not an option, then the linker can
     fix up these calls so that the code compiled without
     '-fsplit-stack' always has a large stack.  Support for this is
     implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21 and
     later.

'-fleading-underscore'
     This option and its counterpart, '-fno-leading-underscore',
     forcibly change the way C symbols are represented in the object
     file.  One use is to help link with legacy assembly code.

     *Warning:* the '-fleading-underscore' switch causes GCC to generate
     code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
     switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
     interface.  Not all targets provide complete support for this
     switch.

'-ftls-model=MODEL'
     Alter the thread-local storage model to be used (*note
     Thread-Local::).  The MODEL argument should be one of
     'global-dynamic', 'local-dynamic', 'initial-exec' or 'local-exec'.
     Note that the choice is subject to optimization: the compiler may
     use a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the
     translation unit, or if '-fpic' is not given on the command line.

     The default without '-fpic' is 'initial-exec'; with '-fpic' the
     default is 'global-dynamic'.

'-fvisibility=DEFAULT|INTERNAL|HIDDEN|PROTECTED'
     Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified
     option--all symbols are marked with this unless overridden within
     the code.  Using this feature can very substantially improve
     linking and load times of shared object libraries, produce more
     optimized code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol
     clashes.  It is *strongly* recommended that you use this in any
     shared objects you distribute.

     Despite the nomenclature, 'default' always means public; i.e.,
     available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
     'protected' and 'internal' are pretty useless in real-world usage
     so the only other commonly used option is 'hidden'.  The default if
     '-fvisibility' isn't specified is 'default', i.e., make every
     symbol public--this causes the same behavior as previous versions
     of GCC.

     A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols
     have the correct visibility is given by "How To Write Shared
     Libraries" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
     <http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/>)--however a superior solution
     made possible by this option to marking things hidden when the
     default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
     public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with
     '-fvisibility=hidden' and '__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))'
     instead of '__declspec(dllexport)' you get almost identical
     semantics with identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those
     working with cross-platform projects.

     For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
     '#pragma GCC visibility' of use.  This works by you enclosing the
     declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
     '#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)' and '#pragma GCC visibility
     pop'.  Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed *as
     part of the API interface contract* and thus all new code should
     always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e.,
     declarations only for use within the local DSO should *always* be
     marked explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection
     overheads--making this abundantly clear also aids readability and
     self-documentation of the code.  Note that due to ISO C++
     specification requirements, 'operator new' and 'operator delete'
     must always be of default visibility.

     Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular
     system headers and headers from any other library you use, may not
     be expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.
     You may need to explicitly say '#pragma GCC visibility
     push(default)' before including any such headers.

     'extern' declarations are not affected by '-fvisibility', so a lot
     of code can be recompiled with '-fvisibility=hidden' with no
     modifications.  However, this means that calls to 'extern'
     functions with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more
     effective to use '__attribute ((visibility))' and/or '#pragma GCC
     visibility' to tell the compiler which 'extern' declarations should
     be treated as hidden.

     Note that '-fvisibility' does affect C++ vague linkage entities.
     This means that, for instance, an exception class that is be thrown
     between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default visibility so
     that the 'type_info' nodes are unified between the DSOs.

     An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
     is at <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility>.

'-fstrict-volatile-bitfields'
     This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or
     other structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those
     types anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
     field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
     example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might
     require all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you
     can declare all peripheral bit-fields as 'unsigned short' (assuming
     short is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit
     accesses instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.

     If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
     instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
     instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
     any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated
     to the one being updated.

     In some cases, such as when the 'packed' attribute is applied to a
     structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a
     single read or write that is correctly aligned for the target
     machine.  In this case GCC falls back to generating multiple
     accesses rather than code that will fault or truncate the result at
     run time.

     Note: Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write
     accesses are not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is
     therefore recommended to define all bits of the field's type as
     bit-field members.

     The default value of this option is determined by the application
     binary interface for the target processor.

'-fsync-libcalls'
     This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the
     '__sync' family of functions may be used to implement the C++11
     '__atomic' family of functions.

     The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful
     form of the option is '-fno-sync-libcalls'.  This option is used in
     the implementation of the 'libatomic' runtime library.

3.19 Environment Variables Affecting GCC
========================================

This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to
use when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify
other aspects of the compilation environment.

 Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
'-B', '-I' and '-L' (*note Directory Options::).  These take precedence
over places specified using environment variables, which in turn take
precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC.  *Note
Controlling the Compilation Driver 'gcc': (gccint)Driver.

'LANG'
'LC_CTYPE'
'LC_MESSAGES'
'LC_ALL'
     These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
     localization information which allows GCC to work with different
     national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
     'LC_CTYPE' and 'LC_MESSAGES' if it has been configured to do so.
     These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
     installation.  A typical value is 'en_GB.UTF-8' for English in the
     United Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.

     The 'LC_CTYPE' environment variable specifies character
     classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries
     in a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that
     contain quote and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted
     as a string end or escape.

     The 'LC_MESSAGES' environment variable specifies the language to
     use in diagnostic messages.

     If the 'LC_ALL' environment variable is set, it overrides the value
     of 'LC_CTYPE' and 'LC_MESSAGES'; otherwise, 'LC_CTYPE' and
     'LC_MESSAGES' default to the value of the 'LANG' environment
     variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC defaults to
     traditional C English behavior.

'TMPDIR'
     If 'TMPDIR' is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
     files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
     compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for
     example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the
     compiler proper.

'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG'
     Setting 'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' is nearly equivalent to passing
     '-fcompare-debug' to the compiler driver.  See the documentation of
     this option for more details.

'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'
     If 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
     names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is
     added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram,
     but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

     If 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is not set, GCC attempts to figure out an
     appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.

     If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
     tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

     The default value of 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is 'PREFIX/lib/gcc/' where
     PREFIX is the prefix to the installed compiler.  In many cases
     PREFIX is the value of 'prefix' when you ran the 'configure'
     script.

     Other prefixes specified with '-B' take precedence over this
     prefix.

     This prefix is also used for finding files such as 'crt0.o' that
     are used for linking.

     In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
     directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
     directories whose name normally begins with '/usr/local/lib/gcc'
     (more precisely, with the value of 'GCC_INCLUDE_DIR'), GCC tries
     replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
     alternate directory name.  Thus, with '-Bfoo/', GCC searches
     'foo/bar' just before it searches the standard directory
     '/usr/local/lib/bar'.  If a standard directory begins with the
     configured PREFIX then the value of PREFIX is replaced by
     'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' when looking for header files.

'COMPILER_PATH'
     The value of 'COMPILER_PATH' is a colon-separated list of
     directories, much like 'PATH'.  GCC tries the directories thus
     specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
     subprograms using 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.

'LIBRARY_PATH'
     The value of 'LIBRARY_PATH' is a colon-separated list of
     directories, much like 'PATH'.  When configured as a native
     compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching
     for special linker files, if it can't find them using
     'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  Linking using GCC also uses these directories
     when searching for ordinary libraries for the '-l' option (but
     directories specified with '-L' come first).

'LANG'
     This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.
     One way in which this information is used is to determine the
     character set to be used when character literals, string literals
     and comments are parsed in C and C++.  When the compiler is
     configured to allow multibyte characters, the following values for
     'LANG' are recognized:

     'C-JIS'
          Recognize JIS characters.
     'C-SJIS'
          Recognize SJIS characters.
     'C-EUCJP'
          Recognize EUCJP characters.

     If 'LANG' is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
     compiler uses 'mblen' and 'mbtowc' as defined by the default locale
     to recognize and translate multibyte characters.

Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.

'CPATH'
'C_INCLUDE_PATH'
'CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH'
'OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH'
     Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a
     special character, much like 'PATH', in which to look for header
     files.  The special character, 'PATH_SEPARATOR', is
     target-dependent and determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft
     Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other
     targets it is a colon.

     'CPATH' specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
     specified with '-I', but after any paths given with '-I' options on
     the command line.  This environment variable is used regardless of
     which language is being preprocessed.

     The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing
     the particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of
     directories to be searched as if specified with '-isystem', but
     after any paths given with '-isystem' options on the command line.

     In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
     search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at
     the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
     'CPATH' is ':/special/include', that has the same effect as
     '-I. -I/special/include'.

'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT'
     If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
     dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files
     processed by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the
     dependency output.

     The value of 'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' can be just a file name, in
     which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the
     target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the
     form 'FILE TARGET', in which case the rules are written to file
     FILE using TARGET as the target name.

     In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to
     combining the options '-MM' and '-MF' (*note Preprocessor
     Options::), with an optional '-MT' switch too.

'SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES'
     This variable is the same as 'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' (see above),
     except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies '-M'
     rather than '-MM'.  However, the dependence on the main input file
     is omitted.  *Note Preprocessor Options::.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Precompiled Headers,  Prev: Environment Variables,  Up: Invoking GCC

3.20 Using Precompiled Headers
==============================

Often large projects have many header files that are included in every
source file.  The time the compiler takes to process these header files
over and over again can account for nearly all of the time required to
build the project.  To make builds faster, GCC allows you to
"precompile" a header file.

 To create a precompiled header file, simply compile it as you would any
other file, if necessary using the '-x' option to make the driver treat
it as a C or C++ header file.  You may want to use a tool like 'make' to
keep the precompiled header up-to-date when the headers it contains
change.

 A precompiled header file is searched for when '#include' is seen in
the compilation.  As it searches for the included file (*note Search
Path: (cpp)Search Path.) the compiler looks for a precompiled header in
each directory just before it looks for the include file in that
directory.  The name searched for is the name specified in the
'#include' with '.gch' appended.  If the precompiled header file can't
be used, it is ignored.

 For instance, if you have '#include "all.h"', and you have 'all.h.gch'
in the same directory as 'all.h', then the precompiled header file is
used if possible, and the original header is used otherwise.

 Alternatively, you might decide to put the precompiled header file in a
directory and use '-I' to ensure that directory is searched before (or
instead of) the directory containing the original header.  Then, if you
want to check that the precompiled header file is always used, you can
put a file of the same name as the original header in this directory
containing an '#error' command.

 This also works with '-include'.  So yet another way to use precompiled
headers, good for projects not designed with precompiled header files in
mind, is to simply take most of the header files used by a project,
include them from another header file, precompile that header file, and
'-include' the precompiled header.  If the header files have guards
against multiple inclusion, they are skipped because they've already
been included (in the precompiled header).

 If you need to precompile the same header file for different languages,
targets, or compiler options, you can instead make a _directory_ named
like 'all.h.gch', and put each precompiled header in the directory,
perhaps using '-o'.  It doesn't matter what you call the files in the
directory; every precompiled header in the directory is considered.  The
first precompiled header encountered in the directory that is valid for
this compilation is used; they're searched in no particular order.

 There are many other possibilities, limited only by your imagination,
good sense, and the constraints of your build system.

 A precompiled header file can be used only when these conditions apply:

   * Only one precompiled header can be used in a particular
     compilation.

   * A precompiled header can't be used once the first C token is seen.
     You can have preprocessor directives before a precompiled header;
     you cannot include a precompiled header from inside another header.

   * The precompiled header file must be produced for the same language
     as the current compilation.  You can't use a C precompiled header
     for a C++ compilation.

   * The precompiled header file must have been produced by the same
     compiler binary as the current compilation is using.

   * Any macros defined before the precompiled header is included must
     either be defined in the same way as when the precompiled header
     was generated, or must not affect the precompiled header, which
     usually means that they don't appear in the precompiled header at
     all.

     The '-D' option is one way to define a macro before a precompiled
     header is included; using a '#define' can also do it.  There are
     also some options that define macros implicitly, like '-O' and
     '-Wdeprecated'; the same rule applies to macros defined this way.

   * If debugging information is output when using the precompiled
     header, using '-g' or similar, the same kind of debugging
     information must have been output when building the precompiled
     header.  However, a precompiled header built using '-g' can be used
     in a compilation when no debugging information is being output.

   * The same '-m' options must generally be used when building and
     using the precompiled header.  *Note Submodel Options::, for any
     cases where this rule is relaxed.

   * Each of the following options must be the same when building and
     using the precompiled header:

          -fexceptions

   * Some other command-line options starting with '-f', '-p', or '-O'
     must be defined in the same way as when the precompiled header was
     generated.  At present, it's not clear which options are safe to
     change and which are not; the safest choice is to use exactly the
     same options when generating and using the precompiled header.  The
     following are known to be safe:

          -fmessage-length=  -fpreprocessed  -fsched-interblock
          -fsched-spec  -fsched-spec-load  -fsched-spec-load-dangerous
          -fsched-verbose=NUMBER  -fschedule-insns  -fvisibility=
          -pedantic-errors

 For all of these except the last, the compiler automatically ignores
the precompiled header if the conditions aren't met.  If you find an
option combination that doesn't work and doesn't cause the precompiled
header to be ignored, please consider filing a bug report, see *note
Bugs::.

 If you do use differing options when generating and using the
precompiled header, the actual behavior is a mixture of the behavior for
the options.  For instance, if you use '-g' to generate the precompiled
header but not when using it, you may or may not get debugging
information for routines in the precompiled header.

4 C Implementation-defined behavior
***********************************

A conforming implementation of ISO C is required to document its choice
of behavior in each of the areas that are designated "implementation
defined".  The following lists all such areas, along with the section
numbers from the ISO/IEC 9899:1990, ISO/IEC 9899:1999 and ISO/IEC
9899:2011 standards.  Some areas are only implementation-defined in one
version of the standard.

 Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform
(including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are
listed as "determined by ABI" below.  *Note Binary Compatibility:
Compatibility, and <http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html>.  Some choices are
documented in the preprocessor manual.  *Note Implementation-defined
behavior: (cpp)Implementation-defined behavior.  Some choices are made
by the library and operating system (or other environment when compiling
for a freestanding environment); refer to their documentation for
details.

     For internal names, all characters are significant.  For external
     names, the number of significant characters are defined by the
     linker; for almost all targets, all characters are significant.

   * 'Whether case distinctions are significant in an identifier with
     external linkage (C90 6.1.2).'

     This is a property of the linker.  C99 and C11 require that case
     distinctions are always significant in identifiers with external
     linkage and systems without this property are not supported by GCC.

4.5 Integers
============

   * 'Any extended integer types that exist in the implementation (C99
     and C11 6.2.5).'

     GCC does not support any extended integer types.

   * 'Whether signed integer types are represented using sign and
     magnitude, two's complement, or one's complement, and whether the
     extraordinary value is a trap representation or an ordinary value
     (C99 and C11 6.2.6.2).'

     GCC supports only two's complement integer types, and all bit
     patterns are ordinary values.

   * 'The rank of any extended integer type relative to another extended
     integer type with the same precision (C99 and C11 6.3.1.1).'

     GCC does not support any extended integer types.

   * 'The result of, or the signal raised by, converting an integer to a
     signed integer type when the value cannot be represented in an
     object of that type (C90 6.2.1.2, C99 and C11 6.3.1.3).'

     For conversion to a type of width N, the value is reduced modulo
     2^N to be within range of the type; no signal is raised.

   * 'The results of some bitwise operations on signed integers (C90
     6.3, C99 and C11 6.5).'

     Bitwise operators act on the representation of the value including
     both the sign and value bits, where the sign bit is considered
     immediately above the highest-value value bit.  Signed '>>' acts on
     negative numbers by sign extension.

     GCC does not use the latitude given in C99 and C11 only to treat
     certain aspects of signed '<<' as undefined, but this is subject to
     change.

   * 'The sign of the remainder on integer division (C90 6.3.5).'

     GCC always follows the C99 and C11 requirement that the result of
     division is truncated towards zero.

     functions in '<math.h>' and '<complex.h>' that return
     floating-point results (C90, C99 and C11 5.2.4.2.2).'

     The accuracy is unknown.

     C99 Annex F is followed.

   * 'How the nearest representable value or the larger or smaller
     representable value immediately adjacent to the nearest
     representable value is chosen for certain floating constants (C90

     C99 Annex F is followed.

   * 'Whether and how floating expressions are contracted when not
     disallowed by the 'FP_CONTRACT' pragma (C99 and C11 6.5).'

     Expressions are currently only contracted if '-ffp-contract=fast',

4.7 Arrays and pointers
=======================

   * 'The result of converting a pointer to an integer or vice versa
     (C90 6.3.4, C99 and C11 6.3.2.3).'

     A cast from pointer to integer discards most-significant bits if
     the pointer representation is larger than the integer type,
     sign-extends(1) if the pointer representation is smaller than the
     integer type, otherwise the bits are unchanged.

     A cast from integer to pointer discards most-significant bits if
     the pointer representation is smaller than the integer type,
     extends according to the signedness of the integer type if the
     pointer representation is larger than the integer type, otherwise
     the bits are unchanged.

     When casting from pointer to integer and back again, the resulting
     pointer must reference the same object as the original pointer,
     otherwise the behavior is undefined.  That is, one may not use
     integer arithmetic to avoid the undefined behavior of pointer
     arithmetic as proscribed in C99 and C11 6.5.6/8.

   * 'The size of the result of subtracting two pointers to elements of
     the same array (C90 6.3.6, C99 and C11 6.5.6).'

     The value is as specified in the standard and the type is
     determined by the ABI.

'ptr_extend' pattern.  Do not rely on sign extension.

4.8 Hints
=========

   * 'The extent to which suggestions made by using the 'register'
     storage-class specifier are effective (C90 6.5.1, C99 and C11
     6.7.1).'

     The 'register' specifier affects code generation only in these
     ways:

        * When used as part of the register variable extension, see
          *note Explicit Reg Vars::.

        * When '-O0' is in use, the compiler allocates distinct stack
          memory for all variables that do not have the 'register'
          storage-class specifier; if 'register' is specified, the
          variable may have a shorter lifespan than the code would
          indicate and may never be placed in memory.

        * On some rare x86 targets, 'setjmp' doesn't save the registers
          in all circumstances.  In those cases, GCC doesn't allocate
          any variables in registers unless they are marked 'register'.

   * 'The extent to which suggestions made by using the inline function
     specifier are effective (C99 and C11 6.7.4).'

     GCC will not inline any functions if the '-fno-inline' option is
     used or if '-O0' is used.  Otherwise, GCC may still be unable to
     inline a function for many reasons; the '-Winline' option may be
     used to determine if a function has not been inlined and why not.

4.9 Structures, unions, enumerations, and bit-fields
====================================================

   * 'A member of a union object is accessed using a member of a
     different type (C90 6.3.2.3).'

     The relevant bytes of the representation of the object are treated
     as an object of the type used for the access.  *Note
     Type-punning::.  This may be a trap representation.

   * 'Whether a "plain" 'int' bit-field is treated as a 'signed int'
     bit-field or as an 'unsigned int' bit-field (C90 6.5.2, C90
     6.5.2.1, C99 and C11 6.7.2, C99 and C11 6.7.2.1).'

     By default it is treated as 'signed int' but this may be changed by
     the '-funsigned-bitfields' option.

   * 'Allowable bit-field types other than '_Bool', 'signed int', and
     'unsigned int' (C99 and C11 6.7.2.1).'

     Other integer types, such as 'long int', and enumerated types are
     permitted even in strictly conforming mode.

   * 'Whether atomic types are permitted for bit-fields (C11 6.7.2.1).'

     Atomic types are not permitted for bit-fields.

   * 'Whether a bit-field can straddle a storage-unit boundary (C90
     6.5.2.1, C99 and C11 6.7.2.1).'

     Determined by ABI.

   * 'The order of allocation of bit-fields within a unit (C90 6.5.2.1,
     C99 and C11 6.7.2.1).'

     Determined by ABI.

   * 'The alignment of non-bit-field members of structures (C90 6.5.2.1,
     C99 and C11 6.7.2.1).'

     Determined by ABI.

   * 'The integer type compatible with each enumerated type (C90
     6.5.2.2, C99 and C11 6.7.2.2).'

     Normally, the type is 'unsigned int' if there are no negative
     values in the enumeration, otherwise 'int'.  If '-fshort-enums' is
     specified, then if there are negative values it is the first of
     'signed char', 'short' and 'int' that can represent all the values,
     otherwise it is the first of 'unsigned char', 'unsigned short' and
     'unsigned int' that can represent all the values.

     On some targets, '-fshort-enums' is the default; this is determined
     by the ABI.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Qualifiers implementation,  Next: Declarators implementation,  Prev: Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation,  Up: C Implementation

4.10 Qualifiers
===============

   * 'What constitutes an access to an object that has
     volatile-qualified type (C90 6.5.3, C99 and C11 6.7.3).'

     Such an object is normally accessed by pointers and used for
     accessing hardware.  In most expressions, it is intuitively obvious
     what is a read and what is a write.  For example

          volatile int *dst = SOMEVALUE;
          volatile int *src = SOMEOTHERVALUE;
          *dst = *src;

     will cause a read of the volatile object pointed to by SRC and
     store the value into the volatile object pointed to by DST.  There
     is no guarantee that these reads and writes are atomic, especially
     for objects larger than 'int'.

     However, if the volatile storage is not being modified, and the
     value of the volatile storage is not used, then the situation is
     less obvious.  For example

          volatile int *src = SOMEVALUE;
          *src;

     According to the C standard, such an expression is an rvalue whose
     type is the unqualified version of its original type, i.e.  'int'.
     Whether GCC interprets this as a read of the volatile object being
     pointed to or only as a request to evaluate the expression for its
     side-effects depends on this type.

     If it is a scalar type, or on most targets an aggregate type whose
     only member object is of a scalar type, or a union type whose
     member objects are of scalar types, the expression is interpreted
     by GCC as a read of the volatile object; in the other cases, the
     expression is only evaluated for its side-effects.

choice of behavior in each of the areas that are designated
"implementation defined".  The following lists all such areas, along
with the section numbers from the ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and ISO/IEC
14882:2003 standards.  Some areas are only implementation-defined in one
version of the standard.

 Some choices depend on the externally determined ABI for the platform
(including standard character encodings) which GCC follows; these are
listed as "determined by ABI" below.  *Note Binary Compatibility:

6.1 Statements and Declarations in Expressions
==============================================

A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.

 Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:

     ({ int y = foo (); int z;
        if (y > 0) z = y;
        else z = - y;
        z; })

is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression for
the absolute value of 'foo ()'.

 The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type 'void', and thus
effectively no value.)

 This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe"
(so that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:

     #define max(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

But this definition computes either A or B twice, with bad results if
the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the type of the
operands (here taken as 'int'), you can define the macro safely as
follows:

     #define maxint(a,b) \
       ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a > _b ? _a : _b; })

 Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit-field, or the
initial value of a static variable.

 If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but
you must use 'typeof' or '__auto_type' (*note Typeof::).

 In G++, the result value of a statement expression undergoes array and
function pointer decay, and is returned by value to the enclosing
expression.  For instance, if 'A' is a class, then

             A a;

             ({a;}).Foo ()

constructs a temporary 'A' object to hold the result of the statement
expression, and that is used to invoke 'Foo'.  Therefore the 'this'
pointer observed by 'Foo' is not the address of 'a'.

 In a statement expression, any temporaries created within a statement
are destroyed at that statement's end.  This makes statement expressions
inside macros slightly different from function calls.  In the latter
case temporaries introduced during argument evaluation are destroyed at
the end of the statement that includes the function call.  In the
statement expression case they are destroyed during the statement
expression.  For instance,

     #define macro(a)  ({__typeof__(a) b = (a); b + 3; })
     template<typename T> T function(T a) { T b = a; return b + 3; }

     void foo ()
     {
       macro (X ());
       function (X ());
     }

has different places where temporaries are destroyed.  For the 'macro'
case, the temporary 'X' is destroyed just after the initialization of
'b'.  In the 'function' case that temporary is destroyed when the
function returns.

 These considerations mean that it is probably a bad idea to use
statement expressions of this form in header files that are designed to
work with C++.  (Note that some versions of the GNU C Library contained
header files using statement expressions that lead to precisely this
bug.)

 Jumping into a statement expression with 'goto' or using a 'switch'
statement outside the statement expression with a 'case' or 'default'
label inside the statement expression is not permitted.  Jumping into a
statement expression with a computed 'goto' (*note Labels as Values::)
has undefined behavior.  Jumping out of a statement expression is
permitted, but if the statement expression is part of a larger
expression then it is unspecified which other subexpressions of that
expression have been evaluated except where the language definition
requires certain subexpressions to be evaluated before or after the
statement expression.  In any case, as with a function call, the
evaluation of a statement expression is not interleaved with the
evaluation of other parts of the containing expression.  For example,

       foo (), (({ bar1 (); goto a; 0; }) + bar2 ()), baz();

calls 'foo' and 'bar1' and does not call 'baz' but may or may not call
'bar2'.  If 'bar2' is called, it is called after 'foo' and before
'bar1'.

6.2 Locally Declared Labels
===========================

GCC allows you to declare "local labels" in any nested block scope.  A
local label is just like an ordinary label, but you can only reference
it (with a 'goto' statement, or by taking its address) within the block
in which it is declared.

 A local label declaration looks like this:

     __label__ LABEL;

or

     __label__ LABEL1, LABEL2, /* ... */;

 Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the block,
before any ordinary declarations or statements.

 The label declaration defines the label _name_, but does not define the
label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with 'LABEL:', within
the statements of the statement expression.

 The local label feature is useful for complex macros.  If a macro
contains nested loops, a 'goto' can be useful for breaking out of them.
However, an ordinary label whose scope is the whole function cannot be
used: if the macro can be expanded several times in one function, the
label is multiply defined in that function.  A local label avoids this
problem.  For example:

     #define SEARCH(value, array, target)              \
     do {                                              \
       __label__ found;                                \
       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
       int i, j;                                       \
       int value;                                      \
       for (i = 0; i < max; i++)                       \
         for (j = 0; j < max; j++)                     \
           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
             { (value) = i; goto found; }              \
       (value) = -1;                                   \
      found:;                                          \
     } while (0)

 This could also be written using a statement expression:

     #define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
     ({                                                \
       __label__ found;                                \
       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
       int i, j;                                       \
       int value;                                      \
       for (i = 0; i < max; i++)                       \
         for (j = 0; j < max; j++)                     \
           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
             { value = i; goto found; }                \
       value = -1;                                     \
      found:                                           \
       value;                                          \
     })

 Local label declarations also make the labels they declare visible to
nested functions, if there are any.  *Note Nested Functions::, for
details.

6.3 Labels as Values
====================

You can get the address of a label defined in the current function (or a
containing function) with the unary operator '&&'.  The value has type
'void *'.  This value is a constant and can be used wherever a constant
of that type is valid.  For example:

     void *ptr;
     /* ... */
     ptr = &&foo;

 To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement(1), 'goto *EXP;'.  For example,

     goto *ptr;

Any expression of type 'void *' is allowed.

 One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
serves as a jump table:

     static void *array[] = { &&foo, &&bar, &&hack };

Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:

     goto *array[i];

Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds--array
indexing in C never does that.

 Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
'switch' statement.  The 'switch' statement is cleaner, so use that
rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a 'switch'
statement very well.

 Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code.
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the threaded
code for super-fast dispatching.

 You may not use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.
If you do that, totally unpredictable things happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.

 An alternate way to write the above example is

     static const int array[] = { &&foo - &&foo, &&bar - &&foo,
                                  &&hack - &&foo };
     goto *(&&foo + array[i]);

This is more friendly to code living in shared libraries, as it reduces
the number of dynamic relocations that are needed, and by consequence,
allows the data to be read-only.  This alternative with label
differences is not supported for the AVR target, please use the first
approach for AVR programs.

 The '&&foo' expressions for the same label might have different values
if the containing function is inlined or cloned.  If a program relies on
them being always the same, '__attribute__((__noinline__,__noclone__))'
should be used to prevent inlining and cloning.  If '&&foo' is used in a
static variable initializer, inlining and cloning is forbidden.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The analogous feature in Fortran is called an assigned goto, but
that name seems inappropriate in C, where one can do more than simply
store label addresses in label variables.

6.4 Nested Functions
====================

A "nested function" is a function defined inside another function.
Nested functions are supported as an extension in GNU C, but are not
supported by GNU C++.

 The nested function's name is local to the block where it is defined.
For example, here we define a nested function named 'square', and call
it twice:

     foo (double a, double b)
     {
       double square (double z) { return z * z; }

       return square (a) + square (b);
     }

 The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called "lexical scoping".  For example, here we show a nested function
which uses an inherited variable named 'offset':

     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       int access (int *array, int index)
         { return array[index + offset]; }
       int i;
       /* ... */
       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
         /* ... */ access (array, i) /* ... */
     }

 Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the
places where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block,
mixed with the other declarations and statements in the block.

 It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of
its name by storing its address or passing the address to another
function:

     hack (int *array, int size)
     {
       void store (int index, int value)
         { array[index] = value; }

       intermediate (store, size);
     }

 Here, the function 'intermediate' receives the address of 'store' as an
argument.  If 'intermediate' calls 'store', the arguments given to
'store' are used to store into 'array'.  But this technique works only
so long as the containing function ('hack', in this example) does not
exit.

 If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function exits, all hell breaks loose.  If you try to call it
after a containing scope level exits, and if it refers to some of the
variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky, but it's not
wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function does not refer
to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be safe.

 GCC implements taking the address of a nested function using a
technique called "trampolines".  This technique was described in
'Lexical Closures for C++' (Thomas M. Breuel, USENIX C++ Conference
Proceedings, October 17-21, 1988).

 A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label is explicitly declared in the containing
function (*note Local Labels::).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function that did the 'goto' and
any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:

     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       __label__ failure;
       int access (int *array, int index)
         {
           if (index > size)
             goto failure;
           return array[index + offset];
         }
       int i;
       /* ... */
       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
         /* ... */ access (array, i) /* ... */
       /* ... */
       return 0;

      /* Control comes here from 'access'
         if it detects an error.  */
      failure:
       return -1;
     }

 A nested function always has no linkage.  Declaring one with 'extern'
or 'static' is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
before its definition, use 'auto' (which is otherwise meaningless for
function declarations).

     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       __label__ failure;
       auto int access (int *, int);
       /* ... */
       int access (int *array, int index)
         {
           if (index > size)
             goto failure;
           return array[index + offset];
         }
       /* ... */
     }

6.5 Constructing Function Calls
===============================

Using the built-in functions described below, you can record the
arguments a function received, and call another function with the same
arguments, without knowing the number or types of the arguments.

 You can also record the return value of that function call, and later
return that value, without knowing what data type the function tried to
return (as long as your caller expects that data type).

 However, these built-in functions may interact badly with some
sophisticated features or other extensions of the language.  It is,
therefore, not recommended to use them outside very simple functions
acting as mere forwarders for their arguments.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_apply_args ()
     This built-in function returns a pointer to data describing how to
     perform a call with the same arguments as are passed to the current
     function.

     The function saves the arg pointer register, structure value
     address, and all registers that might be used to pass arguments to
     a function into a block of memory allocated on the stack.  Then it
     returns the address of that block.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_apply (void (*FUNCTION)(), void
          *ARGUMENTS, size_t SIZE)
     This built-in function invokes FUNCTION with a copy of the
     parameters described by ARGUMENTS and SIZE.

     The value of ARGUMENTS should be the value returned by
     '__builtin_apply_args'.  The argument SIZE specifies the size of
     the stack argument data, in bytes.

     This function returns a pointer to data describing how to return
     whatever value is returned by FUNCTION.  The data is saved in a
     block of memory allocated on the stack.

     It is not always simple to compute the proper value for SIZE.  The
     value is used by '__builtin_apply' to compute the amount of data
     that should be pushed on the stack and copied from the incoming
     argument area.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_return (void *RESULT)
     This built-in function returns the value described by RESULT from
     the containing function.  You should specify, for RESULT, a value
     returned by '__builtin_apply'.

 -- Built-in Function: __builtin_va_arg_pack ()
     This built-in function represents all anonymous arguments of an
     inline function.  It can be used only in inline functions that are
     always inlined, never compiled as a separate function, such as
     those using '__attribute__ ((__always_inline__))' or '__attribute__
     ((__gnu_inline__))' extern inline functions.  It must be only
     passed as last argument to some other function with variable
     arguments.  This is useful for writing small wrapper inlines for
     variable argument functions, when using preprocessor macros is
     undesirable.  For example:
          extern int myprintf (FILE *f, const char *format, ...);
          extern inline __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)) int
          myprintf (FILE *f, const char *format, ...)
          {
            int r = fprintf (f, "myprintf: ");
            if (r < 0)
              return r;
            int s = fprintf (f, format, __builtin_va_arg_pack ());
            if (s < 0)
              return s;
            return r + s;
          }

 -- Built-in Function: size_t __builtin_va_arg_pack_len ()
     This built-in function returns the number of anonymous arguments of
     an inline function.  It can be used only in inline functions that
     are always inlined, never compiled as a separate function, such as
     those using '__attribute__ ((__always_inline__))' or '__attribute__
     ((__gnu_inline__))' extern inline functions.  For example following
     does link- or run-time checking of open arguments for optimized
     code:
          #ifdef __OPTIMIZE__
          extern inline __attribute__((__gnu_inline__)) int
          myopen (const char *path, int oflag, ...)
          {
            if (__builtin_va_arg_pack_len () > 1)
              warn_open_too_many_arguments ();

            if (__builtin_constant_p (oflag))
              {
                if ((oflag & O_CREAT) != 0 && __builtin_va_arg_pack_len () < 1)
                  {
                    warn_open_missing_mode ();
                    return __open_2 (path, oflag);
                  }
                return open (path, oflag, __builtin_va_arg_pack ());
              }

            if (__builtin_va_arg_pack_len () < 1)
              return __open_2 (path, oflag);

            return open (path, oflag, __builtin_va_arg_pack ());
          }
          #endif

6.6 Referring to a Type with 'typeof'
=====================================

Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with 'typeof'.  The
syntax of using of this keyword looks like 'sizeof', but the construct
acts semantically like a type name defined with 'typedef'.

 There are two ways of writing the argument to 'typeof': with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:

     typeof (x[0](1))

This assumes that 'x' is an array of pointers to functions; the type
described is that of the values of the functions.

 Here is an example with a typename as the argument:

     typeof (int *)

Here the type described is that of pointers to 'int'.

 If you are writing a header file that must work when included in ISO C
programs, write '__typeof__' instead of 'typeof'.  *Note Alternate
Keywords::.

 A 'typeof' construct can be used anywhere a typedef name can be used.
For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside of
'sizeof' or 'typeof'.

 The operand of 'typeof' is evaluated for its side effects if and only
if it is an expression of variably modified type or the name of such a
type.

 'typeof' is often useful in conjunction with statement expressions
(*note Statement Exprs::).  Here is how the two together can be used to
define a safe "maximum" macro which operates on any arithmetic type and
evaluates each of its arguments exactly once:

     #define max(a,b) \
       ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); \
           typeof (b) _b = (b); \
         _a > _b ? _a : _b; })

 The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within
the expressions that are substituted for 'a' and 'b'.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to
declare variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this
will be a more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.

Some more examples of the use of 'typeof':

   * This declares 'y' with the type of what 'x' points to.

          typeof (*x) y;

   * This declares 'y' as an array of such values.

          typeof (*x) y[4];

   * This declares 'y' as an array of pointers to characters:

          typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;

     It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:

          char *y[4];

     To see the meaning of the declaration using 'typeof', and why it
     might be a useful way to write, rewrite it with these macros:

          #define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
          #define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])

     Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:

          array (pointer (char), 4) y;

     Thus, 'array (pointer (char), 4)' is the type of arrays of 4
     pointers to 'char'.

 In GNU C, but not GNU C++, you may also declare the type of a variable
as '__auto_type'.  In that case, the declaration must declare only one
variable, whose declarator must just be an identifier, the declaration
must be initialized, and the type of the variable is determined by the
initializer; the name of the variable is not in scope until after the
initializer.  (In C++, you should use C++11 'auto' for this purpose.)
Using '__auto_type', the "maximum" macro above could be written as:

     #define max(a,b) \
       ({ __auto_type _a = (a); \
           __auto_type _b = (b); \
         _a > _b ? _a : _b; })

 Using '__auto_type' instead of 'typeof' has two advantages:

   * Each argument to the macro appears only once in the expansion of
     the macro.  This prevents the size of the macro expansion growing
     exponentially when calls to such macros are nested inside arguments
     of such macros.

   * If the argument to the macro has variably modified type, it is
     evaluated only once when using '__auto_type', but twice if 'typeof'
     is used.

 _Compatibility Note:_ In addition to 'typeof', GCC 2 supported a more
limited extension that permitted one to write

     typedef T = EXPR;

with the effect of declaring T to have the type of the expression EXPR.
This extension does not work with GCC 3 (versions between 3.0 and 3.2
crash; 3.2.1 and later give an error).  Code that relies on it should be
rewritten to use 'typeof':

     typedef typeof(EXPR) T;

This works with all versions of GCC.

6.7 Conditionals with Omitted Operands
======================================

The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then if
the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the conditional
expression.

 Therefore, the expression

     x ? : y

has the value of 'x' if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of 'y'.

 This example is perfectly equivalent to

     x ? x : y

In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand
does, or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then
repeating the operand in the middle would perform the side effect twice.
Omitting the middle operand uses the value already computed without the
undesirable effects of recomputing it.

6.8 128-bit integers
====================

As an extension the integer scalar type '__int128' is supported for
targets which have an integer mode wide enough to hold 128 bits.  Simply
write '__int128' for a signed 128-bit integer, or 'unsigned __int128'
for an unsigned 128-bit integer.  There is no support in GCC for
expressing an integer constant of type '__int128' for targets with 'long
long' integer less than 128 bits wide.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Long Long,  Next: Complex,  Prev: __int128,  Up: C Extensions

6.9 Double-Word Integers
========================

ISO C99 supports data types for integers that are at least 64 bits wide,
and as an extension GCC supports them in C90 mode and in C++.  Simply
write 'long long int' for a signed integer, or 'unsigned long long int'
for an unsigned integer.  To make an integer constant of type 'long long
int', add the suffix 'LL' to the integer.  To make an integer constant
of type 'unsigned long long int', add the suffix 'ULL' to the integer.

 You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types.
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types are
open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded if
the machine supports a fullword-to-doubleword widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GCC.

 There may be pitfalls when you use 'long long' types for function
arguments without function prototypes.  If a function expects type 'int'
for its argument, and you pass a value of type 'long long int',
confusion results because the caller and the subroutine disagree about
the number of bytes for the argument.  Likewise, if the function expects
'long long int' and you pass 'int'.  The best way to avoid such problems
is to use prototypes.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Complex,  Next: Floating Types,  Prev: Long Long,  Up: C Extensions

6.10 Complex Numbers
====================

ISO C99 supports complex floating data types, and as an extension GCC
supports them in C90 mode and in C++.  GCC also supports complex integer
data types which are not part of ISO C99.  You can declare complex types
using the keyword '_Complex'.  As an extension, the older GNU keyword
'__complex__' is also supported.

 For example, '_Complex double x;' declares 'x' as a variable whose real
part and imaginary part are both of type 'double'.  '_Complex short int
y;' declares 'y' to have real and imaginary parts of type 'short int';
this is not likely to be useful, but it shows that the set of complex
types is complete.

 To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix 'i' or 'j'
(either one; they are equivalent).  For example, '2.5fi' has type
'_Complex float' and '3i' has type '_Complex int'.  Such a constant
always has a pure imaginary value, but you can form any complex value
you like by adding one to a real constant.  This is a GNU extension; if
you have an ISO C99 conforming C library (such as the GNU C Library),
and want to construct complex constants of floating type, you should
include '<complex.h>' and use the macros 'I' or '_Complex_I' instead.

 To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression EXP, write
'__real__ EXP'.  Likewise, use '__imag__' to extract the imaginary part.
This is a GNU extension; for values of floating type, you should use the
ISO C99 functions 'crealf', 'creal', 'creall', 'cimagf', 'cimag' and
'cimagl', declared in '<complex.h>' and also provided as built-in
functions by GCC.

 The operator '~' performs complex conjugation when used on a value with
a complex type.  This is a GNU extension; for values of floating type,
you should use the ISO C99 functions 'conjf', 'conj' and 'conjl',
declared in '<complex.h>' and also provided as built-in functions by
GCC.

 GCC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice versa).  Only the DWARF 2
debug info format can represent this, so use of DWARF 2 is recommended.
If you are using the stabs debug info format, GCC describes a
noncontiguous complex variable as if it were two separate variables of
noncomplex type.  If the variable's actual name is 'foo', the two
fictitious variables are named 'foo$real' and 'foo$imag'.  You can
examine and set these two fictitious variables with your debugger.

6.11 Additional Floating Types
==============================

As an extension, GNU C supports additional floating types, '__float80'
and '__float128' to support 80-bit ('XFmode') and 128-bit ('TFmode')
floating types.  Support for additional types includes the arithmetic
operators: add, subtract, multiply, divide; unary arithmetic operators;
relational operators; equality operators; and conversions to and from
integer and other floating types.  Use a suffix 'w' or 'W' in a literal
constant of type '__float80' and 'q' or 'Q' for '_float128'.  You can
declare complex types using the corresponding internal complex type,
'XCmode' for '__float80' type and 'TCmode' for '__float128' type:

     typedef _Complex float __attribute__((mode(TC))) _Complex128;
     typedef _Complex float __attribute__((mode(XC))) _Complex80;

 Not all targets support additional floating-point types.  '__float80'
and '__float128' types are supported on i386, x86_64 and IA-64 targets.
The '__float128' type is supported on hppa HP-UX targets.

6.12 Half-Precision Floating Point
==================================

On ARM targets, GCC supports half-precision (16-bit) floating point via
the '__fp16' type.  You must enable this type explicitly with the
'-mfp16-format' command-line option in order to use it.

 ARM supports two incompatible representations for half-precision
floating-point values.  You must choose one of the representations and
use it consistently in your program.

 Specifying '-mfp16-format=ieee' selects the IEEE 754-2008 format.  This
format can represent normalized values in the range of 2^{-14} to 65504.
There are 11 bits of significand precision, approximately 3 decimal
digits.

 Specifying '-mfp16-format=alternative' selects the ARM alternative
format.  This representation is similar to the IEEE format, but does not
support infinities or NaNs.  Instead, the range of exponents is
extended, so that this format can represent normalized values in the
range of 2^{-14} to 131008.

 The '__fp16' type is a storage format only.  For purposes of arithmetic
and other operations, '__fp16' values in C or C++ expressions are
automatically promoted to 'float'.  In addition, you cannot declare a
function with a return value or parameters of type '__fp16'.

 Note that conversions from 'double' to '__fp16' involve an intermediate
conversion to 'float'.  Because of rounding, this can sometimes produce
a different result than a direct conversion.

 ARM provides hardware support for conversions between '__fp16' and
'float' values as an extension to VFP and NEON (Advanced SIMD). GCC
generates code using these hardware instructions if you compile with
options to select an FPU that provides them; for example,
'-mfpu=neon-fp16 -mfloat-abi=softfp', in addition to the '-mfp16-format'
option to select a half-precision format.

 Language-level support for the '__fp16' data type is independent of
whether GCC generates code using hardware floating-point instructions.
In cases where hardware support is not specified, GCC implements
conversions between '__fp16' and 'float' values as library calls.

6.13 Decimal Floating Types
===========================

As an extension, GNU C supports decimal floating types as defined in the
N1312 draft of ISO/IEC WDTR24732.  Support for decimal floating types in
GCC will evolve as the draft technical report changes.  Calling
conventions for any target might also change.  Not all targets support
decimal floating types.

 The decimal floating types are '_Decimal32', '_Decimal64', and
'_Decimal128'.  They use a radix of ten, unlike the floating types
'float', 'double', and 'long double' whose radix is not specified by the
C standard but is usually two.

 Support for decimal floating types includes the arithmetic operators
add, subtract, multiply, divide; unary arithmetic operators; relational
operators; equality operators; and conversions to and from integer and
other floating types.  Use a suffix 'df' or 'DF' in a literal constant
of type '_Decimal32', 'dd' or 'DD' for '_Decimal64', and 'dl' or 'DL'
for '_Decimal128'.

 GCC support of decimal float as specified by the draft technical report
is incomplete:

   * When the value of a decimal floating type cannot be represented in
     the integer type to which it is being converted, the result is
     undefined rather than the result value specified by the draft
     technical report.

   * GCC does not provide the C library functionality associated with
     'math.h', 'fenv.h', 'stdio.h', 'stdlib.h', and 'wchar.h', which
     must come from a separate C library implementation.  Because of
     this the GNU C compiler does not define macro '__STDC_DEC_FP__' to
     indicate that the implementation conforms to the technical report.

 Types '_Decimal32', '_Decimal64', and '_Decimal128' are supported by
the DWARF 2 debug information format.

6.14 Hex Floats
===============

ISO C99 supports floating-point numbers written not only in the usual
decimal notation, such as '1.55e1', but also numbers such as '0x1.fp3'
written in hexadecimal format.  As a GNU extension, GCC supports this in
C90 mode (except in some cases when strictly conforming) and in C++.  In
that format the '0x' hex introducer and the 'p' or 'P' exponent field
are mandatory.  The exponent is a decimal number that indicates the
power of 2 by which the significant part is multiplied.  Thus '0x1.f' is
1 15/16, 'p3' multiplies it by 8, and the value of '0x1.fp3' is the same
as '1.55e1'.

 Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the exponent
is always required in the hexadecimal notation.  Otherwise the compiler
would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., '0x1.f'.  This
could mean '1.0f' or '1.9375' since 'f' is also the extension for
floating-point constants of type 'float'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Fixed-Point,  Next: Named Address Spaces,  Prev: Hex Floats,  Up: C Extensions

6.15 Fixed-Point Types
======================

As an extension, GNU C supports fixed-point types as defined in the
N1169 draft of ISO/IEC DTR 18037.  Support for fixed-point types in GCC
will evolve as the draft technical report changes.  Calling conventions
for any target might also change.  Not all targets support fixed-point
types.

 The fixed-point types are 'short _Fract', '_Fract', 'long _Fract',
'long long _Fract', 'unsigned short _Fract', 'unsigned _Fract',
'unsigned long _Fract', 'unsigned long long _Fract', '_Sat short
_Fract', '_Sat _Fract', '_Sat long _Fract', '_Sat long long _Fract',
'_Sat unsigned short _Fract', '_Sat unsigned _Fract', '_Sat unsigned
long _Fract', '_Sat unsigned long long _Fract', 'short _Accum',
'_Accum', 'long _Accum', 'long long _Accum', 'unsigned short _Accum',
'unsigned _Accum', 'unsigned long _Accum', 'unsigned long long _Accum',
'_Sat short _Accum', '_Sat _Accum', '_Sat long _Accum', '_Sat long long
_Accum', '_Sat unsigned short _Accum', '_Sat unsigned _Accum', '_Sat
unsigned long _Accum', '_Sat unsigned long long _Accum'.

 Fixed-point data values contain fractional and optional integral parts.
The format of fixed-point data varies and depends on the target machine.

 Support for fixed-point types includes:
   * prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators ('++', '--')
   * unary arithmetic operators ('+', '-', '!')
   * binary arithmetic operators ('+', '-', '*', '/')
   * binary shift operators ('<<', '>>')
   * relational operators ('<', '<=', '>=', '>')
   * equality operators ('==', '!=')
   * assignment operators ('+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '<<=', '>>=')
   * conversions to and from integer, floating-point, or fixed-point
     types

 Use a suffix in a fixed-point literal constant:
   * 'hr' or 'HR' for 'short _Fract' and '_Sat short _Fract'
   * 'r' or 'R' for '_Fract' and '_Sat _Fract'
   * 'lr' or 'LR' for 'long _Fract' and '_Sat long _Fract'
   * 'llr' or 'LLR' for 'long long _Fract' and '_Sat long long _Fract'
   * 'uhr' or 'UHR' for 'unsigned short _Fract' and '_Sat unsigned short
     _Fract'
   * 'ur' or 'UR' for 'unsigned _Fract' and '_Sat unsigned _Fract'
   * 'ulr' or 'ULR' for 'unsigned long _Fract' and '_Sat unsigned long
     _Fract'
   * 'ullr' or 'ULLR' for 'unsigned long long _Fract' and '_Sat unsigned
     long long _Fract'
   * 'hk' or 'HK' for 'short _Accum' and '_Sat short _Accum'
   * 'k' or 'K' for '_Accum' and '_Sat _Accum'
   * 'lk' or 'LK' for 'long _Accum' and '_Sat long _Accum'
   * 'llk' or 'LLK' for 'long long _Accum' and '_Sat long long _Accum'
   * 'uhk' or 'UHK' for 'unsigned short _Accum' and '_Sat unsigned short
     _Accum'
   * 'uk' or 'UK' for 'unsigned _Accum' and '_Sat unsigned _Accum'
   * 'ulk' or 'ULK' for 'unsigned long _Accum' and '_Sat unsigned long
     _Accum'
   * 'ullk' or 'ULLK' for 'unsigned long long _Accum' and '_Sat unsigned
     long long _Accum'

 GCC support of fixed-point types as specified by the draft technical
report is incomplete:

   * Pragmas to control overflow and rounding behaviors are not
     implemented.

 Fixed-point types are supported by the DWARF 2 debug information
format.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Named Address Spaces,  Next: Zero Length,  Prev: Fixed-Point,  Up: C Extensions

6.16 Named Address Spaces
=========================

As an extension, GNU C supports named address spaces as defined in the
N1275 draft of ISO/IEC DTR 18037.  Support for named address spaces in
GCC will evolve as the draft technical report changes.  Calling
conventions for any target might also change.  At present, only the AVR,
SPU, M32C, and RL78 targets support address spaces other than the
generic address space.

 Address space identifiers may be used exactly like any other C type
qualifier (e.g., 'const' or 'volatile').  See the N1275 document for
more details.

6.16.1 AVR Named Address Spaces
-------------------------------

On the AVR target, there are several address spaces that can be used in
order to put read-only data into the flash memory and access that data
by means of the special instructions 'LPM' or 'ELPM' needed to read from
flash.

 Per default, any data including read-only data is located in RAM (the
generic address space) so that non-generic address spaces are needed to
locate read-only data in flash memory _and_ to generate the right
instructions to access this data without using (inline) assembler code.

'__flash'
     The '__flash' qualifier locates data in the '.progmem.data'
     section.  Data is read using the 'LPM' instruction.  Pointers to
     this address space are 16 bits wide.

'__flash1'
'__flash2'
'__flash3'
'__flash4'
'__flash5'
     These are 16-bit address spaces locating data in section
     '.progmemN.data' where N refers to address space '__flashN'.  The
     compiler sets the 'RAMPZ' segment register appropriately before
     reading data by means of the 'ELPM' instruction.

'__memx'
     This is a 24-bit address space that linearizes flash and RAM: If
     the high bit of the address is set, data is read from RAM using the
     lower two bytes as RAM address.  If the high bit of the address is
     clear, data is read from flash with 'RAMPZ' set according to the
     high byte of the address.  *Note '__builtin_avr_flash_segment': AVR
     Built-in Functions.

     Objects in this address space are located in '.progmemx.data'.

 Example

     char my_read (const __flash char ** p)
     {
         /* p is a pointer to RAM that points to a pointer to flash.
            The first indirection of p reads that flash pointer
            from RAM and the second indirection reads a char from this
            flash address.  */

         return **p;
     }

     /* Locate array[] in flash memory */
     const __flash int array[] = { 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 };

     int i = 1;

     int main (void)
     {
        /* Return 17 by reading from flash memory */
        return array[array[i]];
     }

For each named address space supported by avr-gcc there is an equally
named but uppercase built-in macro defined.  The purpose is to
facilitate testing if respective address space support is available or
not:

     #ifdef __FLASH
     const __flash int var = 1;

     int read_var (void)
     {
         return var;
     }
     #else
     #include <avr/pgmspace.h> /* From AVR-LibC */

     const int var PROGMEM = 1;

     int read_var (void)
     {
         return (int) pgm_read_word (&var);
     }
     #endif /* __FLASH */

Notice that attribute *note 'progmem': AVR Variable Attributes. locates
data in flash but accesses to these data read from generic address
space, i.e. from RAM, so that you need special accessors like
'pgm_read_byte' from AVR-LibC (http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/)
together with attribute 'progmem'.

Limitations and caveats

   * Reading across the 64 KiB section boundary of the '__flash' or
     '__flashN' address spaces shows undefined behavior.  The only
     address space that supports reading across the 64 KiB flash segment
     boundaries is '__memx'.

   * If you use one of the '__flashN' address spaces you must arrange
     your linker script to locate the '.progmemN.data' sections
     according to your needs.

   * Any data or pointers to the non-generic address spaces must be
     qualified as 'const', i.e. as read-only data.  This still applies
     if the data in one of these address spaces like software version
     number or calibration lookup table are intended to be changed after
     load time by, say, a boot loader.  In this case the right
     qualification is 'const' 'volatile' so that the compiler must not
     optimize away known values or insert them as immediates into
     operands of instructions.

   * The following code initializes a variable 'pfoo' located in static
     storage with a 24-bit address:
          extern const __memx char foo;
          const __memx void *pfoo = &foo;

     Such code requires at least binutils 2.23, see
     PR13503 (http://sourceware.org/PR13503).

6.16.2 M32C Named Address Spaces
--------------------------------

On the M32C target, with the R8C and M16C CPU variants, variables
qualified with '__far' are accessed using 32-bit addresses in order to
access memory beyond the first 64 Ki bytes.  If '__far' is used with the
M32CM or M32C CPU variants, it has no effect.

6.16.3 RL78 Named Address Spaces
--------------------------------

On the RL78 target, variables qualified with '__far' are accessed with
32-bit pointers (20-bit addresses) rather than the default 16-bit
addresses.  Non-far variables are assumed to appear in the topmost
64 KiB of the address space.

6.16.4 SPU Named Address Spaces
-------------------------------

On the SPU target variables may be declared as belonging to another
address space by qualifying the type with the '__ea' address space
identifier:

     extern int __ea i;

The compiler generates special code to access the variable 'i'.  It may
use runtime library support, or generate special machine instructions to
access that address space.

6.17 Arrays of Length Zero
==========================

Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as the
last element of a structure that is really a header for a
variable-length object:

     struct line {
       int length;
       char contents[0];
     };

     struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
       malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
     thisline->length = this_length;

 In ISO C90, you would have to give 'contents' a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to 'malloc'.

 In ISO C99, you would use a "flexible array member", which is slightly
different in syntax and semantics:

   * Flexible array members are written as 'contents[]' without the '0'.

   * Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the 'sizeof'
     operator may not be applied.  As a quirk of the original
     implementation of zero-length arrays, 'sizeof' evaluates to zero.

   * Flexible array members may only appear as the last member of a
     'struct' that is otherwise non-empty.

   * A structure containing a flexible array member, or a union
     containing such a structure (possibly recursively), may not be a
     member of a structure or an element of an array.  (However, these
     uses are permitted by GCC as extensions.)

 GCC versions before 3.0 allowed zero-length arrays to be statically
initialized, as if they were flexible arrays.  In addition to those
cases that were useful, it also allowed initializations in situations
that would corrupt later data.  Non-empty initialization of zero-length
arrays is now treated like any case where there are more initializer
elements than the array holds, in that a suitable warning about "excess
elements in array" is given, and the excess elements (all of them, in
this case) are ignored.

 Instead GCC allows static initialization of flexible array members.
This is equivalent to defining a new structure containing the original
structure followed by an array of sufficient size to contain the data.
E.g. in the following, 'f1' is constructed as if it were declared like
'f2'.

     struct f1 {
       int x; int y[];
     } f1 = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };

     struct f2 {
       struct f1 f1; int data[3];
     } f2 = { { 1 }, { 2, 3, 4 } };

The convenience of this extension is that 'f1' has the desired type,
eliminating the need to consistently refer to 'f2.f1'.

 This has symmetry with normal static arrays, in that an array of
unknown size is also written with '[]'.

 Of course, this extension only makes sense if the extra data comes at
the end of a top-level object, as otherwise we would be overwriting data
at subsequent offsets.  To avoid undue complication and confusion with
initialization of deeply nested arrays, we simply disallow any non-empty
initialization except when the structure is the top-level object.  For
example:

     struct foo { int x; int y[]; };
     struct bar { struct foo z; };

     struct foo a = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };        // Valid.
     struct bar b = { { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } } };    // Invalid.
     struct bar c = { { 1, { } } };            // Valid.
     struct foo d[1] = { { 1 { 2, 3, 4 } } };  // Invalid.

6.18 Structures With No Members
===============================

GCC permits a C structure to have no members:

     struct empty {
     };

 The structure has size zero.  In C++, empty structures are part of the
language.  G++ treats empty structures as if they had a single member of
type 'char'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Variable Length,  Next: Variadic Macros,  Prev: Empty Structures,  Up: C Extensions

6.19 Arrays of Variable Length
==============================

Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in ISO C99, and as an
extension GCC accepts them in C90 mode and in C++.  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the block scope containing the
declaration exits.  For example:

     FILE *
     concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
     {
       char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
       strcpy (str, s1);
       strcat (str, s2);
       return fopen (str, mode);
     }

 Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.

 As an extension, GCC accepts variable-length arrays as a member of a
structure or a union.  For example:

     void
     foo (int n)
     {
       struct S { int x[n]; };
     }

 You can use the function 'alloca' to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function 'alloca' is available in many
other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.

 There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with 'alloca' exists until the containing _function_ returns.  The space
for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array name's
scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and 'alloca' in the
same function, deallocation of a variable-length array also deallocates
anything more recently allocated with 'alloca'.)

 You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:

     struct entry
     tester (int len, char data[len][len])
     {
       /* ... */
     }

 The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
'sizeof'.

 If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.

     struct entry
     tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
     {
       /* ... */
     }

 The 'int len' before the semicolon is a "parameter forward
declaration", and it serves the purpose of making the name 'len' known
when the declaration of 'data' is parsed.

 You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
declaration in parameter name and data type.  ISO C99 does not support
parameter forward declarations.

6.20 Macros with a Variable Number of Arguments.
================================================

In the ISO C standard of 1999, a macro can be declared to accept a
variable number of arguments much as a function can.  The syntax for
defining the macro is similar to that of a function.  Here is an
example:

     #define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)

Here '...' is a "variable argument".  In the invocation of such a macro,
it represents the zero or more tokens until the closing parenthesis that
ends the invocation, including any commas.  This set of tokens replaces
the identifier '__VA_ARGS__' in the macro body wherever it appears.  See
the CPP manual for more information.

 GCC has long supported variadic macros, and used a different syntax
that allowed you to give a name to the variable arguments just like any
other argument.  Here is an example:

     #define debug(format, args...) fprintf (stderr, format, args)

This is in all ways equivalent to the ISO C example above, but arguably
more readable and descriptive.

 GNU CPP has two further variadic macro extensions, and permits them to
be used with either of the above forms of macro definition.

 In standard C, you are not allowed to leave the variable argument out
entirely; but you are allowed to pass an empty argument.  For example,
this invocation is invalid in ISO C, because there is no comma after the
string:

     debug ("A message")

 GNU CPP permits you to completely omit the variable arguments in this
way.  In the above examples, the compiler would complain, though since
the expansion of the macro still has the extra comma after the format
string.

 To help solve this problem, CPP behaves specially for variable
arguments used with the token paste operator, '##'.  If instead you
write

     #define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, ## __VA_ARGS__)

and if the variable arguments are omitted or empty, the '##' operator
causes the preprocessor to remove the comma before it.  If you do
provide some variable arguments in your macro invocation, GNU CPP does
not complain about the paste operation and instead places the variable
arguments after the comma.  Just like any other pasted macro argument,
these arguments are not macro expanded.

6.21 Slightly Looser Rules for Escaped Newlines
===============================================

Recently, the preprocessor has relaxed its treatment of escaped
newlines.  Previously, the newline had to immediately follow a
backslash.  The current implementation allows whitespace in the form of
spaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, and form feeds between the
backslash and the subsequent newline.  The preprocessor issues a
warning, but treats it as a valid escaped newline and combines the two
lines to form a single logical line.  This works within comments and
tokens, as well as between tokens.  Comments are _not_ treated as
whitespace for the purposes of this relaxation, since they have not yet
been replaced with spaces.

6.22 Non-Lvalue Arrays May Have Subscripts
==========================================

In ISO C99, arrays that are not lvalues still decay to pointers, and may
be subscripted, although they may not be modified or used after the next
sequence point and the unary '&' operator may not be applied to them.
As an extension, GNU C allows such arrays to be subscripted in C90 mode,
though otherwise they do not decay to pointers outside C99 mode.  For
example, this is valid in GNU C though not valid in C90:

     struct foo {int a[4];};

     struct foo f();

6.23 Arithmetic on 'void'- and Function-Pointers
================================================

In GNU C, addition and subtraction operations are supported on pointers
to 'void' and on pointers to functions.  This is done by treating the
size of a 'void' or of a function as 1.

 A consequence of this is that 'sizeof' is also allowed on 'void' and on
function types, and returns 1.

 The option '-Wpointer-arith' requests a warning if these extensions are
used.

6.24 Non-Constant Initializers
==============================

As in standard C++ and ISO C99, the elements of an aggregate initializer
for an automatic variable are not required to be constant expressions in
GNU C.  Here is an example of an initializer with run-time varying
elements:

     foo (float f, float g)
     {
       float beat_freqs[2] = { f-g, f+g };
       /* ... */
     }


File: gcc.info,  Node: Compound Literals,  Next: Designated Inits,  Prev: Initializers,  Up: C Extensions

6.25 Compound Literals
======================

ISO C99 supports compound literals.  A compound literal looks like a
cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the type
specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in the
initializer; it is an lvalue.  As an extension, GCC supports compound
literals in C90 mode and in C++, though the semantics are somewhat
different in C++.

 Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that 'struct foo'
and 'structure' are declared as shown:

     struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;

Here is an example of constructing a 'struct foo' with a compound
literal:

     structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});

This is equivalent to writing the following:

     {
       struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
       structure = temp;
     }

 You can also construct an array, though this is dangerous in C++, as
explained below.  If all the elements of the compound literal are (made
up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for use in initializers of
objects of static storage duration, then the compound literal can be
coerced to a pointer to its first element and used in such an
initializer, as shown here:

     char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };

 Compound literals for scalar types and union types are also allowed,
but then the compound literal is equivalent to a cast.

 As a GNU extension, GCC allows initialization of objects with static
storage duration by compound literals (which is not possible in ISO C99,
because the initializer is not a constant).  It is handled as if the
object is initialized only with the bracket enclosed list if the types
of the compound literal and the object match.  The initializer list of
the compound literal must be constant.  If the object being initialized
has array type of unknown size, the size is determined by compound
literal size.

     static struct foo x = (struct foo) {1, 'a', 'b'};
     static int y[] = (int []) {1, 2, 3};
     static int z[] = (int [3]) {1};

The above lines are equivalent to the following:
     static struct foo x = {1, 'a', 'b'};
     static int y[] = {1, 2, 3};
     static int z[] = {1, 0, 0};

 In C, a compound literal designates an unnamed object with static or
automatic storage duration.  In C++, a compound literal designates a
temporary object, which only lives until the end of its full-expression.
As a result, well-defined C code that takes the address of a subobject
of a compound literal can be undefined in C++.  For instance, if the
array compound literal example above appeared inside a function, any
subsequent use of 'foo' in C++ has undefined behavior because the
lifetime of the array ends after the declaration of 'foo'.  As a result,
the C++ compiler now rejects the conversion of a temporary array to a
pointer.

 As an optimization, the C++ compiler sometimes gives array compound
literals longer lifetimes: when the array either appears outside a
function or has const-qualified type.  If 'foo' and its initializer had
elements of 'char *const' type rather than 'char *', or if 'foo' were a
global variable, the array would have static storage duration.  But it
is probably safest just to avoid the use of array compound literals in
code compiled as C++.

6.26 Designated Initializers
============================

Standard C90 requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a
fixed order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or
structure being initialized.

 In ISO C99 you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to, and GNU C allows this as
an extension in C90 mode as well.  This extension is not implemented in
GNU C++.

 To specify an array index, write '[INDEX] =' before the element value.
For example,

     int a[6] = { [4] = 29, [2] = 15 };

is equivalent to

     int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };

The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.

 An alternative syntax for this that has been obsolete since GCC 2.5 but
GCC still accepts is to write '[INDEX]' before the element value, with
no '='.

 To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write '[FIRST ...
LAST] = VALUE'.  This is a GNU extension.  For example,

     int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };

If the value in it has side-effects, the side-effects happen only once,
not for each initialized field by the range initializer.

Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified plus
one.

 In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with '.FIELDNAME =' before the element value.  For example, given the
following structure,

     struct point { int x, y; };

the following initialization

     struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };

is equivalent to

     struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };

 Another syntax that has the same meaning, obsolete since GCC 2.5, is
'FIELDNAME:', as shown here:

     struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };

 Omitted field members are implicitly initialized the same as objects
that have static storage duration.

 The '[INDEX]' or '.FIELDNAME' is known as a "designator".  You can also
use a designator (or the obsolete colon syntax) when initializing a
union, to specify which element of the union should be used.  For
example,

     union foo { int i; double d; };

     union foo f = { .d = 4 };

converts 4 to a 'double' to store it in the union using the second
element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type 'union foo' stores it into the
union as the integer 'i', since it is an integer.  (*Note Cast to
Union::.)

 You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a designator applies to the next consecutive element of
the array or structure.  For example,

     int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };

is equivalent to

     int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };

 Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful when
the indices are characters or belong to an 'enum' type.  For example:

     int whitespace[256]
       = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
           ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };

 You can also write a series of '.FIELDNAME' and '[INDEX]' designators
before an '=' to specify a nested subobject to initialize; the list is
taken relative to the subobject corresponding to the closest surrounding
brace pair.  For example, with the 'struct point' declaration above:

     struct point ptarray[10] = { [2].y = yv2, [2].x = xv2, [0].x = xv0 };

If the same field is initialized multiple times, it has the value from
the last initialization.  If any such overridden initialization has
side-effect, it is unspecified whether the side-effect happens or not.
Currently, GCC discards them and issues a warning.

6.27 Case Ranges
================

You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single 'case' label,
like this:

     case LOW ... HIGH:

This has the same effect as the proper number of individual 'case'
labels, one for each integer value from LOW to HIGH, inclusive.

 This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character codes:

     case 'A' ... 'Z':

 *Be careful:* Write spaces around the '...', for otherwise it may be
parsed wrong when you use it with integer values.  For example, write
this:

     case 1 ... 5:

rather than this:

     case 1...5:

6.28 Cast to a Union Type
=========================

A cast to union type is similar to other casts, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with 'union
TAG' or with a typedef name.  A cast to union is actually a constructor,
not a cast, and hence does not yield an lvalue like normal casts.
(*Note Compound Literals::.)

 The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:

     union foo { int i; double d; };
     int x;
     double y;

both 'x' and 'y' can be cast to type 'union foo'.

 Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable of
union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:

     union foo u;
     /* ... */
     u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
     u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y

 You can also use the union cast as a function argument:

     void hack (union foo);
     /* ... */
     hack ((union foo) x);


File: gcc.info,  Node: Mixed Declarations,  Next: Function Attributes,  Prev: Cast to Union,  Up: C Extensions

6.29 Mixed Declarations and Code
================================

ISO C99 and ISO C++ allow declarations and code to be freely mixed
within compound statements.  As an extension, GNU C also allows this in
C90 mode.  For example, you could do:

     int i;
     /* ... */
     i++;
     int j = i + 2;

 Each identifier is visible from where it is declared until the end of
the enclosing block.

6.30 Declaring Attributes of Functions
======================================

In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your
program which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your
code more carefully.

 The keyword '__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes
when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an attribute
specification inside double parentheses.  The following attributes are
currently defined for functions on all targets: 'aligned', 'alloc_size',
'alloc_align', 'assume_aligned', 'noreturn', 'returns_twice',
'noinline', 'noclone', 'always_inline', 'flatten', 'pure', 'const',
'nothrow', 'sentinel', 'format', 'format_arg', 'no_instrument_function',
'no_split_stack', 'section', 'constructor', 'destructor', 'used',
'unused', 'deprecated', 'weak', 'malloc', 'alias', 'ifunc',
'warn_unused_result', 'nonnull', 'returns_nonnull', 'gnu_inline',
'externally_visible', 'hot', 'cold', 'artificial',
'no_sanitize_address', 'no_address_safety_analysis',
'no_sanitize_undefined', 'error' and 'warning'.  Several other
attributes are defined for functions on particular target systems.
Other attributes, including 'section' are supported for variables
declarations (*note Variable Attributes::) and for types (*note Type
Attributes::).

 GCC plugins may provide their own attributes.

 You may also specify attributes with '__' preceding and following each
keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without being
concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example, you may
use '__noreturn__' instead of 'noreturn'.

 *Note Attribute Syntax::, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

'alias ("TARGET")'
     The 'alias' attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
     alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,

          void __f () { /* Do something. */; }
          void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));

     defines 'f' to be a weak alias for '__f'.  In C++, the mangled name
     for the target must be used.  It is an error if '__f' is not
     defined in the same translation unit.

     Not all target machines support this attribute.

'aligned (ALIGNMENT)'
     This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the function,
     measured in bytes.

     You cannot use this attribute to decrease the alignment of a
     function, only to increase it.  However, when you explicitly
     specify a function alignment this overrides the effect of the
     '-falign-functions' (*note Optimize Options::) option for this
     function.

     Note that the effectiveness of 'aligned' attributes may be limited
     by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
     linker is only able to arrange for functions to be aligned up to a
     certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum
     supported alignment may be very very small.)  See your linker
     documentation for further information.

     The 'aligned' attribute can also be used for variables and fields
     (*note Variable Attributes::.)

'alloc_size'
     The 'alloc_size' attribute is used to tell the compiler that the
     function return value points to memory, where the size is given by
     one or two of the functions parameters.  GCC uses this information
     to improve the correctness of '__builtin_object_size'.

     The function parameter(s) denoting the allocated size are specified
     by one or two integer arguments supplied to the attribute.  The
     allocated size is either the value of the single function argument
     specified or the product of the two function arguments specified.
     Argument numbering starts at one.

     For instance,

          void* my_calloc(size_t, size_t) __attribute__((alloc_size(1,2)))
          void* my_realloc(void*, size_t) __attribute__((alloc_size(2)))

     declares that 'my_calloc' returns memory of the size given by the
     product of parameter 1 and 2 and that 'my_realloc' returns memory
     of the size given by parameter 2.

'alloc_align'
     The 'alloc_align' attribute is used to tell the compiler that the
     function return value points to memory, where the returned pointer
     minimum alignment is given by one of the functions parameters.  GCC
     uses this information to improve pointer alignment analysis.

     The function parameter denoting the allocated alignment is
     specified by one integer argument, whose number is the argument of
     the attribute.  Argument numbering starts at one.

     For instance,

          void* my_memalign(size_t, size_t) __attribute__((alloc_align(1)))

     declares that 'my_memalign' returns memory with minimum alignment
     given by parameter 1.

'assume_aligned'
     The 'assume_aligned' attribute is used to tell the compiler that
     the function return value points to memory, where the returned
     pointer minimum alignment is given by the first argument.  If the
     attribute has two arguments, the second argument is misalignment
     offset.

     For instance

          void* my_alloc1(size_t) __attribute__((assume_aligned(16)))
          void* my_alloc2(size_t) __attribute__((assume_aligned(32, 8)))

     declares that 'my_alloc1' returns 16-byte aligned pointer and that
     'my_alloc2' returns a pointer whose value modulo 32 is equal to 8.

'always_inline'
     Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is
     specified.  For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines
     the function even if no optimization level is specified.

'gnu_inline'
     This attribute should be used with a function that is also declared
     with the 'inline' keyword.  It directs GCC to treat the function as
     if it were defined in gnu90 mode even when compiling in C99 or
     gnu99 mode.

     If the function is declared 'extern', then this definition of the
     function is used only for inlining.  In no case is the function
     compiled as a standalone function, not even if you take its address
     explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as if
     you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.  This
     has almost the effect of a macro.  The way to use this is to put a
     function definition in a header file with this attribute, and put
     another copy of the function, without 'extern', in a library file.
     The definition in the header file causes most calls to the function
     to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they refer to
     the single copy in the library.  Note that the two definitions of
     the functions need not be precisely the same, although if they do
     not have the same effect your program may behave oddly.

     In C, if the function is neither 'extern' nor 'static', then the
     function is compiled as a standalone function, as well as being
     inlined where possible.

     This is how GCC traditionally handled functions declared 'inline'.
     Since ISO C99 specifies a different semantics for 'inline', this
     function attribute is provided as a transition measure and as a
     useful feature in its own right.  This attribute is available in
     GCC 4.1.3 and later.  It is available if either of the preprocessor
     macros '__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__' or '__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__' are defined.
     *Note An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro: Inline.

     In C++, this attribute does not depend on 'extern' in any way, but
     it still requires the 'inline' keyword to enable its special
     behavior.

'artificial'
     This attribute is useful for small inline wrappers that if possible
     should appear during debugging as a unit.  Depending on the debug
     info format it either means marking the function as artificial or
     using the caller location for all instructions within the inlined
     body.

'bank_switch'
     When added to an interrupt handler with the M32C port, causes the
     prologue and epilogue to use bank switching to preserve the
     registers rather than saving them on the stack.

'flatten'
     Generally, inlining into a function is limited.  For a function
     marked with this attribute, every call inside this function is
     inlined, if possible.  Whether the function itself is considered
     for inlining depends on its size and the current inlining
     parameters.

'error ("MESSAGE")'
     If this attribute is used on a function declaration and a call to
     such a function is not eliminated through dead code elimination or
     other optimizations, an error that includes MESSAGE is diagnosed.
     This is useful for compile-time checking, especially together with
     '__builtin_constant_p' and inline functions where checking the
     inline function arguments is not possible through 'extern char
     [(condition) ? 1 : -1];' tricks.  While it is possible to leave the
     function undefined and thus invoke a link failure, when using this
     attribute the problem is diagnosed earlier and with exact location
     of the call even in presence of inline functions or when not
     emitting debugging information.

'warning ("MESSAGE")'
     If this attribute is used on a function declaration and a call to
     such a function is not eliminated through dead code elimination or
     other optimizations, a warning that includes MESSAGE is diagnosed.
     This is useful for compile-time checking, especially together with
     '__builtin_constant_p' and inline functions.  While it is possible
     to define the function with a message in '.gnu.warning*' section,
     when using this attribute the problem is diagnosed earlier and with
     exact location of the call even in presence of inline functions or
     when not emitting debugging information.

'cdecl'
     On the Intel 386, the 'cdecl' attribute causes the compiler to
     assume that the calling function pops off the stack space used to
     pass arguments.  This is useful to override the effects of the
     '-mrtd' switch.

'const'
     Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments,
     and have no effects except the return value.  Basically this is
     just slightly more strict class than the 'pure' attribute below,
     since function is not allowed to read global memory.

     Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the
     data pointed to must _not_ be declared 'const'.  Likewise, a
     function that calls a non-'const' function usually must not be
     'const'.  It does not make sense for a 'const' function to return
     'void'.

     The attribute 'const' is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
     than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no
     side effects, which works in the current version and in some older
     versions, is as follows:

          typedef int intfn ();

          extern const intfn square;

     This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the
     language specifies that the 'const' must be attached to the return
     value.

'constructor'
'destructor'
'constructor (PRIORITY)'
'destructor (PRIORITY)'
     The 'constructor' attribute causes the function to be called
     automatically before execution enters 'main ()'.  Similarly, the
     'destructor' attribute causes the function to be called
     automatically after 'main ()' completes or 'exit ()' is called.
     Functions with these attributes are useful for initializing data
     that is used implicitly during the execution of the program.

     You may provide an optional integer priority to control the order
     in which constructor and destructor functions are run.  A
     constructor with a smaller priority number runs before a
     constructor with a larger priority number; the opposite
     relationship holds for destructors.  So, if you have a constructor
     that allocates a resource and a destructor that deallocates the
     same resource, both functions typically have the same priority.
     The priorities for constructor and destructor functions are the
     same as those specified for namespace-scope C++ objects (*note C++
     Attributes::).

     These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective-C.

'deprecated'
'deprecated (MSG)'
     The 'deprecated' attribute results in a warning if the function is
     used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
     functions that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
     program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
     of the deprecated function, to enable users to easily find further
     information about why the function is deprecated, or what they
     should do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:

          int old_fn () __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          int old_fn ();
          int (*fn_ptr)() = old_fn;

     results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.  The optional MSG
     argument, which must be a string, is printed in the warning if
     present.

     The 'deprecated' attribute can also be used for variables and types
     (*note Variable Attributes::, *note Type Attributes::.)

'disinterrupt'
     On Epiphany and MeP targets, this attribute causes the compiler to
     emit instructions to disable interrupts for the duration of the
     given function.

'dllexport'
     On Microsoft Windows targets and Symbian OS targets the 'dllexport'
     attribute causes the compiler to provide a global pointer to a
     pointer in a DLL, so that it can be referenced with the 'dllimport'
     attribute.  On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer name is
     formed by combining '_imp__' and the function or variable name.

     You can use '__declspec(dllexport)' as a synonym for '__attribute__
     ((dllexport))' for compatibility with other compilers.

     On systems that support the 'visibility' attribute, this attribute
     also implies "default" visibility.  It is an error to explicitly
     specify any other visibility.

     In previous versions of GCC, the 'dllexport' attribute was ignored
     for inlined functions, unless the '-fkeep-inline-functions' flag
     had been used.  The default behavior now is to emit all dllexported
     inline functions; however, this can cause object file-size bloat,
     in which case the old behavior can be restored by using
     '-fno-keep-inline-dllexport'.

     The attribute is also ignored for undefined symbols.

     When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks defined
     non-inlined member functions and static data members as exports.
     Static consts initialized in-class are not marked unless they are
     also defined out-of-class.

     For Microsoft Windows targets there are alternative methods for
     including the symbol in the DLL's export table such as using a
     '.def' file with an 'EXPORTS' section or, with GNU ld, using the
     '--export-all' linker flag.

'dllimport'
     On Microsoft Windows and Symbian OS targets, the 'dllimport'
     attribute causes the compiler to reference a function or variable
     via a global pointer to a pointer that is set up by the DLL
     exporting the symbol.  The attribute implies 'extern'.  On
     Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer name is formed by combining
     '_imp__' and the function or variable name.

     You can use '__declspec(dllimport)' as a synonym for '__attribute__
     ((dllimport))' for compatibility with other compilers.

     On systems that support the 'visibility' attribute, this attribute
     also implies "default" visibility.  It is an error to explicitly
     specify any other visibility.

     Currently, the attribute is ignored for inlined functions.  If the
     attribute is applied to a symbol _definition_, an error is
     reported.  If a symbol previously declared 'dllimport' is later
     defined, the attribute is ignored in subsequent references, and a
     warning is emitted.  The attribute is also overridden by a
     subsequent declaration as 'dllexport'.

     When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks non-inlined member
     functions and static data members as imports.  However, the
     attribute is ignored for virtual methods to allow creation of
     vtables using thunks.

     On the SH Symbian OS target the 'dllimport' attribute also has
     another affect--it can cause the vtable and run-time type
     information for a class to be exported.  This happens when the
     class has a dllimported constructor or a non-inline, non-pure
     virtual function and, for either of those two conditions, the class
     also has an inline constructor or destructor and has a key function
     that is defined in the current translation unit.

     For Microsoft Windows targets the use of the 'dllimport' attribute
     on functions is not necessary, but provides a small performance
     benefit by eliminating a thunk in the DLL.  The use of the
     'dllimport' attribute on imported variables was required on older
     versions of the GNU linker, but can now be avoided by passing the
     '--enable-auto-import' switch to the GNU linker.  As with
     functions, using the attribute for a variable eliminates a thunk in
     the DLL.

     One drawback to using this attribute is that a pointer to a
     _variable_ marked as 'dllimport' cannot be used as a constant
     address.  However, a pointer to a _function_ with the 'dllimport'
     attribute can be used as a constant initializer; in this case, the
     address of a stub function in the import lib is referenced.  On
     Microsoft Windows targets, the attribute can be disabled for
     functions by setting the '-mnop-fun-dllimport' flag.

'eightbit_data'
     Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that
     the specified variable should be placed into the eight-bit data
     section.  The compiler generates more efficient code for certain
     operations on data in the eight-bit data area.  Note the eight-bit
     data area is limited to 256 bytes of data.

     You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
     this attribute to work correctly.

'exception'
     Use this attribute on the NDS32 target to indicate that the
     specified function is an exception handler.  The compiler will
     generate corresponding sections for use in an exception handler.

'exception_handler'
     Use this attribute on the Blackfin to indicate that the specified
     function is an exception handler.  The compiler generates function
     entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an exception handler
     when this attribute is present.

'externally_visible'
     This attribute, attached to a global variable or function,
     nullifies the effect of the '-fwhole-program' command-line option,
     so the object remains visible outside the current compilation unit.

     If '-fwhole-program' is used together with '-flto' and 'gold' is
     used as the linker plugin, 'externally_visible' attributes are
     automatically added to functions (not variable yet due to a current
     'gold' issue) that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to
     resolution file produced by 'gold'.  For other linkers that cannot
     generate resolution file, explicit 'externally_visible' attributes
     are still necessary.

'far'
     On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the 'far' attribute causes the compiler to use
     a calling convention that takes care of switching memory banks when
     entering and leaving a function.  This calling convention is also
     the default when using the '-mlong-calls' option.

     On 68HC12 the compiler uses the 'call' and 'rtc' instructions to
     call and return from a function.

     On 68HC11 the compiler generates a sequence of instructions to
     invoke a board-specific routine to switch the memory bank and call
     the real function.  The board-specific routine simulates a 'call'.
     At the end of a function, it jumps to a board-specific routine
     instead of using 'rts'.  The board-specific return routine
     simulates the 'rtc'.

     On MeP targets this causes the compiler to use a calling convention
     that assumes the called function is too far away for the built-in
     addressing modes.

'fast_interrupt'
     Use this attribute on the M32C and RX ports to indicate that the
     specified function is a fast interrupt handler.  This is just like
     the 'interrupt' attribute, except that 'freit' is used to return
     instead of 'reit'.

'fastcall'
     On the Intel 386, the 'fastcall' attribute causes the compiler to
     pass the first argument (if of integral type) in the register ECX
     and the second argument (if of integral type) in the register EDX.
     Subsequent and other typed arguments are passed on the stack.  The
     called function pops the arguments off the stack.  If the number of
     arguments is variable all arguments are pushed on the stack.

'thiscall'
     On the Intel 386, the 'thiscall' attribute causes the compiler to
     pass the first argument (if of integral type) in the register ECX.
     Subsequent and other typed arguments are passed on the stack.  The
     called function pops the arguments off the stack.  If the number of
     arguments is variable all arguments are pushed on the stack.  The
     'thiscall' attribute is intended for C++ non-static member
     functions.  As a GCC extension, this calling convention can be used
     for C functions and for static member methods.

'format (ARCHETYPE, STRING-INDEX, FIRST-TO-CHECK)'
     The 'format' attribute specifies that a function takes 'printf',
     'scanf', 'strftime' or 'strfmon' style arguments that should be
     type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
     declaration:

          extern int
          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));

     causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to 'my_printf'
     for consistency with the 'printf' style format string argument
     'my_format'.

     The parameter ARCHETYPE determines how the format string is
     interpreted, and should be 'printf', 'scanf', 'strftime',
     'gnu_printf', 'gnu_scanf', 'gnu_strftime' or 'strfmon'.  (You can
     also use '__printf__', '__scanf__', '__strftime__' or
     '__strfmon__'.)  On MinGW targets, 'ms_printf', 'ms_scanf', and
     'ms_strftime' are also present.  ARCHETYPE values such as 'printf'
     refer to the formats accepted by the system's C runtime library,
     while values prefixed with 'gnu_' always refer to the formats
     accepted by the GNU C Library.  On Microsoft Windows targets,
     values prefixed with 'ms_' refer to the formats accepted by the
     'msvcrt.dll' library.  The parameter STRING-INDEX specifies which
     argument is the format string argument (starting from 1), while
     FIRST-TO-CHECK is the number of the first argument to check against
     the format string.  For functions where the arguments are not
     available to be checked (such as 'vprintf'), specify the third
     parameter as zero.  In this case the compiler only checks the
     format string for consistency.  For 'strftime' formats, the third
     parameter is required to be zero.  Since non-static C++ methods
     have an implicit 'this' argument, the arguments of such methods
     should be counted from two, not one, when giving values for
     STRING-INDEX and FIRST-TO-CHECK.

     In the example above, the format string ('my_format') is the second
     argument of the function 'my_print', and the arguments to check
     start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the
     format attribute are 2 and 3.

     The 'format' attribute allows you to identify your own functions
     that take format strings as arguments, so that GCC can check the
     calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always (unless
     '-ffreestanding' or '-fno-builtin' is used) checks formats for the
     standard library functions 'printf', 'fprintf', 'sprintf', 'scanf',
     'fscanf', 'sscanf', 'strftime', 'vprintf', 'vfprintf' and
     'vsprintf' whenever such warnings are requested (using '-Wformat'),
     so there is no need to modify the header file 'stdio.h'.  In C99
     mode, the functions 'snprintf', 'vsnprintf', 'vscanf', 'vfscanf'
     and 'vsscanf' are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
     standard modes, the X/Open function 'strfmon' is also checked as
     are 'printf_unlocked' and 'fprintf_unlocked'.  *Note Options
     Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

     For Objective-C dialects, 'NSString' (or '__NSString__') is
     recognized in the same context.  Declarations including these
     format attributes are parsed for correct syntax, however the result
     of checking of such format strings is not yet defined, and is not
     carried out by this version of the compiler.

     The target may also provide additional types of format checks.
     *Note Format Checks Specific to Particular Target Machines: Target
     Format Checks.

'format_arg (STRING-INDEX)'
     The 'format_arg' attribute specifies that a function takes a format
     string for a 'printf', 'scanf', 'strftime' or 'strfmon' style
     function and modifies it (for example, to translate it into another
     language), so the result can be passed to a 'printf', 'scanf',
     'strftime' or 'strfmon' style function (with the remaining
     arguments to the format function the same as they would have been
     for the unmodified string).  For example, the declaration:

          extern char *
          my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
                __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));

     causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a 'printf',
     'scanf', 'strftime' or 'strfmon' type function, whose format string
     argument is a call to the 'my_dgettext' function, for consistency
     with the format string argument 'my_format'.  If the 'format_arg'
     attribute had not been specified, all the compiler could tell in
     such calls to format functions would be that the format string
     argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
     '-Wformat-nonliteral' is used, but the calls could not be checked
     without the attribute.

     The parameter STRING-INDEX specifies which argument is the format
     string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods
     have an implicit 'this' argument, the arguments of such methods
     should be counted from two.

     The 'format_arg' attribute allows you to identify your own
     functions that modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
     calls to 'printf', 'scanf', 'strftime' or 'strfmon' type function
     whose operands are a call to one of your own function.  The
     compiler always treats 'gettext', 'dgettext', and 'dcgettext' in
     this manner except when strict ISO C support is requested by
     '-ansi' or an appropriate '-std' option, or '-ffreestanding' or
     '-fno-builtin' is used.  *Note Options Controlling C Dialect: C
     Dialect Options.

     For Objective-C dialects, the 'format-arg' attribute may refer to
     an 'NSString' reference for compatibility with the 'format'
     attribute above.

     The target may also allow additional types in 'format-arg'
     attributes.  *Note Format Checks Specific to Particular Target
     Machines: Target Format Checks.

'function_vector'
     Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that
     the specified function should be called through the function
     vector.  Calling a function through the function vector reduces
     code size, however; the function vector has a limited size (maximum
     128 entries on the H8/300 and 64 entries on the H8/300H and H8S)
     and shares space with the interrupt vector.

     On SH2A targets, this attribute declares a function to be called
     using the TBR relative addressing mode.  The argument to this
     attribute is the entry number of the same function in a vector
     table containing all the TBR relative addressable functions.  For
     correct operation the TBR must be setup accordingly to point to the
     start of the vector table before any functions with this attribute
     are invoked.  Usually a good place to do the initialization is the
     startup routine.  The TBR relative vector table can have at max 256
     function entries.  The jumps to these functions are generated using
     a SH2A specific, non delayed branch instruction JSR/N @(disp8,TBR).
     You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
     this attribute to work correctly.

     Please refer the example of M16C target, to see the use of this
     attribute while declaring a function,

     In an application, for a function being called once, this attribute
     saves at least 8 bytes of code; and if other successive calls are
     being made to the same function, it saves 2 bytes of code per each
     of these calls.

     On M16C/M32C targets, the 'function_vector' attribute declares a
     special page subroutine call function.  Use of this attribute
     reduces the code size by 2 bytes for each call generated to the
     subroutine.  The argument to the attribute is the vector number
     entry from the special page vector table which contains the 16
     low-order bits of the subroutine's entry address.  Each vector
     table has special page number (18 to 255) that is used in 'jsrs'
     instructions.  Jump addresses of the routines are generated by
     adding 0x0F0000 (in case of M16C targets) or 0xFF0000 (in case of
     M32C targets), to the 2-byte addresses set in the vector table.
     Therefore you need to ensure that all the special page vector
     routines should get mapped within the address range 0x0F0000 to
     0x0FFFFF (for M16C) and 0xFF0000 to 0xFFFFFF (for M32C).

     In the following example 2 bytes are saved for each call to
     function 'foo'.

          void foo (void) __attribute__((function_vector(0x18)));
          void foo (void)
          {
          }

          void bar (void)
          {
              foo();
          }

     If functions are defined in one file and are called in another
     file, then be sure to write this declaration in both files.

     This attribute is ignored for R8C target.

'ifunc ("RESOLVER")'
     The 'ifunc' attribute is used to mark a function as an indirect
     function using the STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol type extension to the ELF
     standard.  This allows the resolution of the symbol value to be
     determined dynamically at load time, and an optimized version of
     the routine can be selected for the particular processor or other
     system characteristics determined then.  To use this attribute,
     first define the implementation functions available, and a resolver
     function that returns a pointer to the selected implementation
     function.  The implementation functions' declarations must match
     the API of the function being implemented, the resolver's
     declaration is be a function returning pointer to void function
     returning void:

          void *my_memcpy (void *dst, const void *src, size_t len)
          {
            ...
          }

          static void (*resolve_memcpy (void)) (void)
          {
            return my_memcpy; // we'll just always select this routine
          }

     The exported header file declaring the function the user calls
     would contain:

          extern void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t);

     allowing the user to call this as a regular function, unaware of
     the implementation.  Finally, the indirect function needs to be
     defined in the same translation unit as the resolver function:

          void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
               __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));

     Indirect functions cannot be weak, and require a recent binutils
     (at least version 2.20.1), and GNU C library (at least version
     2.11.1).

'interrupt'
     Use this attribute on the ARC, ARM, AVR, CR16, Epiphany, M32C,
     M32R/D, m68k, MeP, MIPS, MSP430, RL78, RX and Xstormy16 ports to
     indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The
     compiler generates function entry and exit sequences suitable for
     use in an interrupt handler when this attribute is present.  With
     Epiphany targets it may also generate a special section with code
     to initialize the interrupt vector table.

     Note, interrupt handlers for the Blackfin, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S,
     MicroBlaze, and SH processors can be specified via the
     'interrupt_handler' attribute.

     Note, on the ARC, you must specify the kind of interrupt to be
     handled in a parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:

          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("ilink1")));

     Permissible values for this parameter are: 'ilink1' and 'ilink2'.

     Note, on the AVR, the hardware globally disables interrupts when an
     interrupt is executed.  The first instruction of an interrupt
     handler declared with this attribute is a 'SEI' instruction to
     re-enable interrupts.  See also the 'signal' function attribute
     that does not insert a 'SEI' instruction.  If both 'signal' and
     'interrupt' are specified for the same function, 'signal' is
     silently ignored.

     Note, for the ARM, you can specify the kind of interrupt to be
     handled by adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute
     like this:

          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")));

     Permissible values for this parameter are: 'IRQ', 'FIQ', 'SWI',
     'ABORT' and 'UNDEF'.

     On ARMv7-M the interrupt type is ignored, and the attribute means
     the function may be called with a word-aligned stack pointer.

     Note, for the MSP430 you can provide an argument to the interrupt
     attribute which specifies a name or number.  If the argument is a
     number it indicates the slot in the interrupt vector table (0 - 31)
     to which this handler should be assigned.  If the argument is a
     name it is treated as a symbolic name for the vector slot.  These
     names should match up with appropriate entries in the linker
     script.  By default the names 'watchdog' for vector 26, 'nmi' for
     vector 30 and 'reset' for vector 31 are recognised.

     You can also use the following function attributes to modify how
     normal functions interact with interrupt functions:

     'critical'
          Critical functions disable interrupts upon entry and restore
          the previous interrupt state upon exit.  Critical functions
          cannot also have the 'naked' or 'reentrant' attributes.  They
          can have the 'interrupt' attribute.

     'reentrant'
          Reentrant functions disable interrupts upon entry and enable
          them upon exit.  Reentrant functions cannot also have the
          'naked' or 'critical' attributes.  They can have the
          'interrupt' attribute.

     'wakeup'
          This attribute only applies to interrupt functions.  It is
          silently ignored if applied to a non-interrupt function.  A
          wakeup interrupt function will rouse the processor from any
          low-power state that it might be in when the function exits.

     On Epiphany targets one or more optional parameters can be added
     like this:

          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"))) universal_dma_handler ();

     Permissible values for these parameters are: 'reset',
     'software_exception', 'page_miss', 'timer0', 'timer1', 'message',
     'dma0', 'dma1', 'wand' and 'swi'.  Multiple parameters indicate
     that multiple entries in the interrupt vector table should be
     initialized for this function, i.e. for each parameter NAME, a jump
     to the function is emitted in the section ivt_entry_NAME.  The
     parameter(s) may be omitted entirely, in which case no interrupt
     vector table entry is provided.

     Note, on Epiphany targets, interrupts are enabled inside the
     function unless the 'disinterrupt' attribute is also specified.

     On Epiphany targets, you can also use the following attribute to
     modify the behavior of an interrupt handler:
     'forwarder_section'
          The interrupt handler may be in external memory which cannot
          be reached by a branch instruction, so generate a local memory
          trampoline to transfer control.  The single parameter
          identifies the section where the trampoline is placed.

     The following examples are all valid uses of these attributes on
     Epiphany targets:
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt)) universal_handler ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma1"))) dma1_handler ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"))) universal_dma_handler ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("timer0"), disinterrupt))
            fast_timer_handler ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt ("dma0, dma1"), forwarder_section ("tramp")))
            external_dma_handler ();

     On MIPS targets, you can use the following attributes to modify the
     behavior of an interrupt handler:
     'use_shadow_register_set'
          Assume that the handler uses a shadow register set, instead of
          the main general-purpose registers.

     'keep_interrupts_masked'
          Keep interrupts masked for the whole function.  Without this
          attribute, GCC tries to reenable interrupts for as much of the
          function as it can.

     'use_debug_exception_return'
          Return using the 'deret' instruction.  Interrupt handlers that
          don't have this attribute return using 'eret' instead.

     You can use any combination of these attributes, as shown below:
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt)) v0 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set)) v1 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, keep_interrupts_masked)) v2 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_debug_exception_return)) v3 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set,
                               keep_interrupts_masked)) v4 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set,
                               use_debug_exception_return)) v5 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, keep_interrupts_masked,
                               use_debug_exception_return)) v6 ();
          void __attribute__ ((interrupt, use_shadow_register_set,
                               keep_interrupts_masked,
                               use_debug_exception_return)) v7 ();

     On NDS32 target, this attribute is to indicate that the specified
     function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate
     corresponding sections for use in an interrupt handler.  You can
     use the following attributes to modify the behavior:
     'nested'
          This interrupt service routine is interruptible.
     'not_nested'
          This interrupt service routine is not interruptible.
     'nested_ready'
          This interrupt service routine is interruptible after
          'PSW.GIE' (global interrupt enable) is set.  This allows
          interrupt service routine to finish some short critical code
          before enabling interrupts.
     'save_all'
          The system will help save all registers into stack before
          entering interrupt handler.
     'partial_save'
          The system will help save caller registers into stack before
          entering interrupt handler.

     On RL78, use 'brk_interrupt' instead of 'interrupt' for handlers
     intended to be used with the 'BRK' opcode (i.e. those that must end
     with 'RETB' instead of 'RETI').

'interrupt_handler'
     Use this attribute on the Blackfin, m68k, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, and
     SH to indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler.
     The compiler generates function entry and exit sequences suitable
     for use in an interrupt handler when this attribute is present.

'interrupt_thread'
     Use this attribute on fido, a subarchitecture of the m68k, to
     indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler that
     is designed to run as a thread.  The compiler omits generate
     prologue/epilogue sequences and replaces the return instruction
     with a 'sleep' instruction.  This attribute is available only on
     fido.

'isr'
     Use this attribute on ARM to write Interrupt Service Routines.
     This is an alias to the 'interrupt' attribute above.

'kspisusp'
     When used together with 'interrupt_handler', 'exception_handler' or
     'nmi_handler', code is generated to load the stack pointer from the
     USP register in the function prologue.

'l1_text'
     This attribute specifies a function to be placed into L1
     Instruction SRAM.  The function is put into a specific section
     named '.l1.text'.  With '-mfdpic', function calls with a such
     function as the callee or caller uses inlined PLT.

'l2'
     On the Blackfin, this attribute specifies a function to be placed
     into L2 SRAM. The function is put into a specific section named
     '.l1.text'.  With '-mfdpic', callers of such functions use an
     inlined PLT.

'leaf'
     Calls to external functions with this attribute must return to the
     current compilation unit only by return or by exception handling.
     In particular, leaf functions are not allowed to call callback
     function passed to it from the current compilation unit or directly
     call functions exported by the unit or longjmp into the unit.  Leaf
     function might still call functions from other compilation units
     and thus they are not necessarily leaf in the sense that they
     contain no function calls at all.

     The attribute is intended for library functions to improve dataflow
     analysis.  The compiler takes the hint that any data not escaping
     the current compilation unit can not be used or modified by the
     leaf function.  For example, the 'sin' function is a leaf function,
     but 'qsort' is not.

     Note that leaf functions might invoke signals and signal handlers
     might be defined in the current compilation unit and use static
     variables.  The only compliant way to write such a signal handler
     is to declare such variables 'volatile'.

     The attribute has no effect on functions defined within the current
     compilation unit.  This is to allow easy merging of multiple
     compilation units into one, for example, by using the link-time
     optimization.  For this reason the attribute is not allowed on
     types to annotate indirect calls.

'long_call/medium_call/short_call'
     These attributes specify how a particular function is called on
     ARC, ARM and Epiphany - with 'medium_call' being specific to ARC.
     These attributes override the '-mlong-calls' (*note ARM Options::
     and *note ARC Options::) and '-mmedium-calls' (*note ARC Options::)
     command-line switches and '#pragma long_calls' settings.  For ARM,
     the 'long_call' attribute indicates that the function might be far
     away from the call site and require a different (more expensive)
     calling sequence.  The 'short_call' attribute always places the
     offset to the function from the call site into the 'BL' instruction
     directly.

     For ARC, a function marked with the 'long_call' attribute is always
     called using register-indirect jump-and-link instructions, thereby
     enabling the called function to be placed anywhere within the
     32-bit address space.  A function marked with the 'medium_call'
     attribute will always be close enough to be called with an
     unconditional branch-and-link instruction, which has a 25-bit
     offset from the call site.  A function marked with the 'short_call'
     attribute will always be close enough to be called with a
     conditional branch-and-link instruction, which has a 21-bit offset
     from the call site.

'longcall/shortcall'
     On the Blackfin, RS/6000 and PowerPC, the 'longcall' attribute
     indicates that the function might be far away from the call site
     and require a different (more expensive) calling sequence.  The
     'shortcall' attribute indicates that the function is always close
     enough for the shorter calling sequence to be used.  These
     attributes override both the '-mlongcall' switch and, on the
     RS/6000 and PowerPC, the '#pragma longcall' setting.

     *Note RS/6000 and PowerPC Options::, for more information on
     whether long calls are necessary.

'long_call/near/far'
     These attributes specify how a particular function is called on
     MIPS.  The attributes override the '-mlong-calls' (*note MIPS
     Options::) command-line switch.  The 'long_call' and 'far'
     attributes are synonyms, and cause the compiler to always call the
     function by first loading its address into a register, and then
     using the contents of that register.  The 'near' attribute has the
     opposite effect; it specifies that non-PIC calls should be made
     using the more efficient 'jal' instruction.

'malloc'
     The 'malloc' attribute is used to tell the compiler that a function
     may be treated as if any non-'NULL' pointer it returns cannot alias
     any other pointer valid when the function returns and that the
     memory has undefined content.  This often improves optimization.
     Standard functions with this property include 'malloc' and
     'calloc'.  'realloc'-like functions do not have this property as
     the memory pointed to does not have undefined content.

'mips16/nomips16'

     On MIPS targets, you can use the 'mips16' and 'nomips16' function
     attributes to locally select or turn off MIPS16 code generation.  A
     function with the 'mips16' attribute is emitted as MIPS16 code,
     while MIPS16 code generation is disabled for functions with the
     'nomips16' attribute.  These attributes override the '-mips16' and
     '-mno-mips16' options on the command line (*note MIPS Options::).

     When compiling files containing mixed MIPS16 and non-MIPS16 code,
     the preprocessor symbol '__mips16' reflects the setting on the
     command line, not that within individual functions.  Mixed MIPS16
     and non-MIPS16 code may interact badly with some GCC extensions
     such as '__builtin_apply' (*note Constructing Calls::).

'micromips/nomicromips'

     On MIPS targets, you can use the 'micromips' and 'nomicromips'
     function attributes to locally select or turn off microMIPS code
     generation.  A function with the 'micromips' attribute is emitted
     as microMIPS code, while microMIPS code generation is disabled for
     functions with the 'nomicromips' attribute.  These attributes
     override the '-mmicromips' and '-mno-micromips' options on the
     command line (*note MIPS Options::).

     When compiling files containing mixed microMIPS and non-microMIPS
     code, the preprocessor symbol '__mips_micromips' reflects the
     setting on the command line, not that within individual functions.
     Mixed microMIPS and non-microMIPS code may interact badly with some
     GCC extensions such as '__builtin_apply' (*note Constructing
     Calls::).

'model (MODEL-NAME)'

     On the M32R/D, use this attribute to set the addressability of an
     object, and of the code generated for a function.  The identifier
     MODEL-NAME is one of 'small', 'medium', or 'large', representing
     each of the code models.

     Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
     addresses can be loaded with the 'ld24' instruction), and are
     callable with the 'bl' instruction.

     Medium model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space
     (the compiler generates 'seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and are callable with the 'bl' instruction.

     Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space
     (the compiler generates 'seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and may not be reachable with the 'bl' instruction (the
     compiler generates the much slower 'seth/add3/jl' instruction
     sequence).

     On IA-64, use this attribute to set the addressability of an
     object.  At present, the only supported identifier for MODEL-NAME
     is 'small', indicating addressability via "small" (22-bit)
     addresses (so that their addresses can be loaded with the 'addl'
     instruction).  Caveat: such addressing is by definition not
     position independent and hence this attribute must not be used for
     objects defined by shared libraries.

'ms_abi/sysv_abi'

     On 32-bit and 64-bit (i?86|x86_64)-*-* targets, you can use an ABI
     attribute to indicate which calling convention should be used for a
     function.  The 'ms_abi' attribute tells the compiler to use the
     Microsoft ABI, while the 'sysv_abi' attribute tells the compiler to
     use the ABI used on GNU/Linux and other systems.  The default is to
     use the Microsoft ABI when targeting Windows.  On all other
     systems, the default is the x86/AMD ABI.

     Note, the 'ms_abi' attribute for Microsoft Windows 64-bit targets
     currently requires the '-maccumulate-outgoing-args' option.

'callee_pop_aggregate_return (NUMBER)'

     On 32-bit i?86-*-* targets, you can use this attribute to control
     how aggregates are returned in memory.  If the caller is
     responsible for popping the hidden pointer together with the rest
     of the arguments, specify NUMBER equal to zero.  If callee is
     responsible for popping the hidden pointer, specify NUMBER equal to
     one.

     The default i386 ABI assumes that the callee pops the stack for
     hidden pointer.  However, on 32-bit i386 Microsoft Windows targets,
     the compiler assumes that the caller pops the stack for hidden
     pointer.

'ms_hook_prologue'

     On 32-bit i[34567]86-*-* targets and 64-bit x86_64-*-* targets, you
     can use this function attribute to make GCC generate the
     "hot-patching" function prologue used in Win32 API functions in
     Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and newer.

'hotpatch [(PROLOGUE-HALFWORDS)]'

     On S/390 System z targets, you can use this function attribute to
     make GCC generate a "hot-patching" function prologue.  The
     'hotpatch' has no effect on funtions that are explicitly inline.
     If the '-mhotpatch' or '-mno-hotpatch' command-line option is used
     at the same time, the 'hotpatch' attribute takes precedence.  If an
     argument is given, the maximum allowed value is 1000000.

'naked'
     Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, MCORE, MSP430, NDS32, RL78, RX
     and SPU ports to indicate that the specified function does not need
     prologue/epilogue sequences generated by the compiler.  It is up to
     the programmer to provide these sequences.  The only statements
     that can be safely included in naked functions are 'asm' statements
     that do not have operands.  All other statements, including
     declarations of local variables, 'if' statements, and so forth,
     should be avoided.  Naked functions should be used to implement the
     body of an assembly function, while allowing the compiler to
     construct the requisite function declaration for the assembler.

'near'
     On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the 'near' attribute causes the compiler to
     use the normal calling convention based on 'jsr' and 'rts'.  This
     attribute can be used to cancel the effect of the '-mlong-calls'
     option.

     On MeP targets this attribute causes the compiler to assume the
     called function is close enough to use the normal calling
     convention, overriding the '-mtf' command-line option.

'nesting'
     Use this attribute together with 'interrupt_handler',
     'exception_handler' or 'nmi_handler' to indicate that the function
     entry code should enable nested interrupts or exceptions.

'nmi_handler'
     Use this attribute on the Blackfin to indicate that the specified
     function is an NMI handler.  The compiler generates function entry
     and exit sequences suitable for use in an NMI handler when this
     attribute is present.

'nocompression'
     On MIPS targets, you can use the 'nocompression' function attribute
     to locally turn off MIPS16 and microMIPS code generation.  This
     attribute overrides the '-mips16' and '-mmicromips' options on the
     command line (*note MIPS Options::).

'no_instrument_function'
     If '-finstrument-functions' is given, profiling function calls are
     generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions.
     Functions with this attribute are not so instrumented.

'no_split_stack'
     If '-fsplit-stack' is given, functions have a small prologue which
     decides whether to split the stack.  Functions with the
     'no_split_stack' attribute do not have that prologue, and thus may
     run with only a small amount of stack space available.

'noinline'
     This function attribute prevents a function from being considered
     for inlining.  If the function does not have side-effects, there
     are optimizations other than inlining that cause function calls to
     be optimized away, although the function call is live.  To keep
     such calls from being optimized away, put
          asm ("");

     (*note Extended Asm::) in the called function, to serve as a
     special side-effect.

'noclone'
     This function attribute prevents a function from being considered
     for cloning--a mechanism that produces specialized copies of
     functions and which is (currently) performed by interprocedural
     constant propagation.

'nonnull (ARG-INDEX, ...)'
     The 'nonnull' attribute specifies that some function parameters
     should be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:

          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
                  __attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));

     causes the compiler to check that, in calls to 'my_memcpy',
     arguments DEST and SRC are non-null.  If the compiler determines
     that a null pointer is passed in an argument slot marked as
     non-null, and the '-Wnonnull' option is enabled, a warning is
     issued.  The compiler may also choose to make optimizations based
     on the knowledge that certain function arguments will never be
     null.

     If no argument index list is given to the 'nonnull' attribute, all
     pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
     following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:

          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
                  __attribute__((nonnull));

'returns_nonnull'
     The 'returns_nonnull' attribute specifies that the function return
     value should be a non-null pointer.  For instance, the declaration:

          extern void *
          mymalloc (size_t len) __attribute__((returns_nonnull));

     lets the compiler optimize callers based on the knowledge that the
     return value will never be null.

'noreturn'
     A few standard library functions, such as 'abort' and 'exit',
     cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
     their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
     'noreturn' to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));

          void
          fatal (/* ... */)
          {
            /* ... */ /* Print error message. */ /* ... */
            exit (1);
          }

     The 'noreturn' keyword tells the compiler to assume that 'fatal'
     cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what would
     happen if 'fatal' ever did return.  This makes slightly better
     code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
     uninitialized variables.

     The 'noreturn' keyword does not affect the exceptional path when
     that applies: a 'noreturn'-marked function may still return to the
     caller by throwing an exception or calling 'longjmp'.

     Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
     restored before calling the 'noreturn' function.

     It does not make sense for a 'noreturn' function to have a return
     type other than 'void'.

     The attribute 'noreturn' is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
     than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function does not
     return, which works in the current version and in some older
     versions, is as follows:

          typedef void voidfn ();

          volatile voidfn fatal;

     This approach does not work in GNU C++.

'nothrow'
     The 'nothrow' attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
     function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
     the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
     with the notable exceptions of 'qsort' and 'bsearch' that take
     function pointer arguments.  The 'nothrow' attribute is not
     implemented in GCC versions earlier than 3.3.

'nosave_low_regs'
     Use this attribute on SH targets to indicate that an
     'interrupt_handler' function should not save and restore registers
     R0..R7.  This can be used on SH3* and SH4* targets that have a
     second R0..R7 register bank for non-reentrant interrupt handlers.

'optimize'
     The 'optimize' attribute is used to specify that a function is to
     be compiled with different optimization options than specified on
     the command line.  Arguments can either be numbers or strings.
     Numbers are assumed to be an optimization level.  Strings that
     begin with 'O' are assumed to be an optimization option, while
     other options are assumed to be used with a '-f' prefix.  You can
     also use the '#pragma GCC optimize' pragma to set the optimization
     options that affect more than one function.  *Note Function
     Specific Option Pragmas::, for details about the '#pragma GCC
     optimize' pragma.

     This can be used for instance to have frequently-executed functions
     compiled with more aggressive optimization options that produce
     faster and larger code, while other functions can be compiled with
     less aggressive options.

'OS_main/OS_task'
     On AVR, functions with the 'OS_main' or 'OS_task' attribute do not
     save/restore any call-saved register in their prologue/epilogue.

     The 'OS_main' attribute can be used when there _is guarantee_ that
     interrupts are disabled at the time when the function is entered.
     This saves resources when the stack pointer has to be changed to
     set up a frame for local variables.

     The 'OS_task' attribute can be used when there is _no guarantee_
     that interrupts are disabled at that time when the function is
     entered like for, e.g.  task functions in a multi-threading
     operating system.  In that case, changing the stack pointer
     register is guarded by save/clear/restore of the global interrupt
     enable flag.

     The differences to the 'naked' function attribute are:
        * 'naked' functions do not have a return instruction whereas
          'OS_main' and 'OS_task' functions have a 'RET' or 'RETI'
          return instruction.
        * 'naked' functions do not set up a frame for local variables or
          a frame pointer whereas 'OS_main' and 'OS_task' do this as
          needed.

'pcs'

     The 'pcs' attribute can be used to control the calling convention
     used for a function on ARM. The attribute takes an argument that
     specifies the calling convention to use.

     When compiling using the AAPCS ABI (or a variant of it) then valid
     values for the argument are '"aapcs"' and '"aapcs-vfp"'.  In order
     to use a variant other than '"aapcs"' then the compiler must be
     permitted to use the appropriate co-processor registers (i.e., the
     VFP registers must be available in order to use '"aapcs-vfp"').
     For example,

          /* Argument passed in r0, and result returned in r0+r1.  */
          double f2d (float) __attribute__((pcs("aapcs")));

     Variadic functions always use the '"aapcs"' calling convention and
     the compiler rejects attempts to specify an alternative.

'pure'
     Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
     return value depends only on the parameters and/or global
     variables.  Such a function can be subject to common subexpression
     elimination and loop optimization just as an arithmetic operator
     would be.  These functions should be declared with the attribute
     'pure'.  For example,

          int square (int) __attribute__ ((pure));

     says that the hypothetical function 'square' is safe to call fewer
     times than the program says.

     Some of common examples of pure functions are 'strlen' or 'memcmp'.
     Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or
     those depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that
     may change between two consecutive calls (such as 'feof' in a
     multithreading environment).

     The attribute 'pure' is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
     than 2.96.

'hot'
     The 'hot' attribute on a function is used to inform the compiler
     that the function is a hot spot of the compiled program.  The
     function is optimized more aggressively and on many target it is
     placed into special subsection of the text section so all hot
     functions appears close together improving locality.

     When profile feedback is available, via '-fprofile-use', hot
     functions are automatically detected and this attribute is ignored.

     The 'hot' attribute on functions is not implemented in GCC versions
     earlier than 4.3.

     The 'hot' attribute on a label is used to inform the compiler that
     path following the label are more likely than paths that are not so
     annotated.  This attribute is used in cases where
     '__builtin_expect' cannot be used, for instance with computed goto
     or 'asm goto'.

     The 'hot' attribute on labels is not implemented in GCC versions
     earlier than 4.8.

'cold'
     The 'cold' attribute on functions is used to inform the compiler
     that the function is unlikely to be executed.  The function is
     optimized for size rather than speed and on many targets it is
     placed into special subsection of the text section so all cold
     functions appears close together improving code locality of
     non-cold parts of program.  The paths leading to call of cold
     functions within code are marked as unlikely by the branch
     prediction mechanism.  It is thus useful to mark functions used to
     handle unlikely conditions, such as 'perror', as cold to improve
     optimization of hot functions that do call marked functions in rare
     occasions.

     When profile feedback is available, via '-fprofile-use', cold
     functions are automatically detected and this attribute is ignored.

     The 'cold' attribute on functions is not implemented in GCC
     versions earlier than 4.3.

     The 'cold' attribute on labels is used to inform the compiler that
     the path following the label is unlikely to be executed.  This
     attribute is used in cases where '__builtin_expect' cannot be used,
     for instance with computed goto or 'asm goto'.

     The 'cold' attribute on labels is not implemented in GCC versions
     earlier than 4.8.

'no_sanitize_address'
'no_address_safety_analysis'
     The 'no_sanitize_address' attribute on functions is used to inform
     the compiler that it should not instrument memory accesses in the
     function when compiling with the '-fsanitize=address' option.  The
     'no_address_safety_analysis' is a deprecated alias of the
     'no_sanitize_address' attribute, new code should use
     'no_sanitize_address'.

'no_sanitize_undefined'
     The 'no_sanitize_undefined' attribute on functions is used to
     inform the compiler that it should not check for undefined behavior
     in the function when compiling with the '-fsanitize=undefined'
     option.

'regparm (NUMBER)'
     On the Intel 386, the 'regparm' attribute causes the compiler to
     pass arguments number one to NUMBER if they are of integral type in
     registers EAX, EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack.  Functions
     that take a variable number of arguments continue to be passed all
     of their arguments on the stack.

     Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
     global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is
     the default).  Lazy binding sends the first call via resolving code
     in the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be
     clobbered, as per the standard calling conventions.  Solaris 8 is
     affected by this.  Systems with the GNU C Library version 2.1 or
     higher and FreeBSD are believed to be safe since the loaders there
     save EAX, EDX and ECX. (Lazy binding can be disabled with the
     linker or the loader if desired, to avoid the problem.)

'reset'
     Use this attribute on the NDS32 target to indicate that the
     specified function is a reset handler.  The compiler will generate
     corresponding sections for use in a reset handler.  You can use the
     following attributes to provide extra exception handling:
     'nmi'
          Provide a user-defined function to handle NMI exception.
     'warm'
          Provide a user-defined function to handle warm reset
          exception.

'sseregparm'
     On the Intel 386 with SSE support, the 'sseregparm' attribute
     causes the compiler to pass up to 3 floating-point arguments in SSE
     registers instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a variable
     number of arguments continue to pass all of their floating-point
     arguments on the stack.

'force_align_arg_pointer'
     On the Intel x86, the 'force_align_arg_pointer' attribute may be
     applied to individual function definitions, generating an alternate
     prologue and epilogue that realigns the run-time stack if
     necessary.  This supports mixing legacy codes that run with a
     4-byte aligned stack with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack
     for SSE compatibility.

'renesas'
     On SH targets this attribute specifies that the function or struct
     follows the Renesas ABI.

'resbank'
     On the SH2A target, this attribute enables the high-speed register
     saving and restoration using a register bank for
     'interrupt_handler' routines.  Saving to the bank is performed
     automatically after the CPU accepts an interrupt that uses a
     register bank.

     The nineteen 32-bit registers comprising general register R0 to
     R14, control register GBR, and system registers MACH, MACL, and PR
     and the vector table address offset are saved into a register bank.
     Register banks are stacked in first-in last-out (FILO) sequence.
     Restoration from the bank is executed by issuing a RESBANK
     instruction.

'returns_twice'
     The 'returns_twice' attribute tells the compiler that a function
     may return more than one time.  The compiler ensures that all
     registers are dead before calling such a function and emits a
     warning about the variables that may be clobbered after the second
     return from the function.  Examples of such functions are 'setjmp'
     and 'vfork'.  The 'longjmp'-like counterpart of such function, if
     any, might need to be marked with the 'noreturn' attribute.

'saveall'
     Use this attribute on the Blackfin, H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to
     indicate that all registers except the stack pointer should be
     saved in the prologue regardless of whether they are used or not.

'save_volatiles'
     Use this attribute on the MicroBlaze to indicate that the function
     is an interrupt handler.  All volatile registers (in addition to
     non-volatile registers) are saved in the function prologue.  If the
     function is a leaf function, only volatiles used by the function
     are saved.  A normal function return is generated instead of a
     return from interrupt.

'section ("SECTION-NAME")'
     Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the 'text'
     section.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you
     need certain particular functions to appear in special sections.
     The 'section' attribute specifies that a function lives in a
     particular section.  For example, the declaration:

          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));

     puts the function 'foobar' in the 'bar' section.

     Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the
     'section' attribute is not available on all platforms.  If you need
     to map the entire contents of a module to a particular section,
     consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

'sentinel'
     This function attribute ensures that a parameter in a function call
     is an explicit 'NULL'.  The attribute is only valid on variadic
     functions.  By default, the sentinel is located at position zero,
     the last parameter of the function call.  If an optional integer
     position argument P is supplied to the attribute, the sentinel must
     be located at position P counting backwards from the end of the
     argument list.

          __attribute__ ((sentinel))
          is equivalent to
          __attribute__ ((sentinel(0)))

     The attribute is automatically set with a position of 0 for the
     built-in functions 'execl' and 'execlp'.  The built-in function
     'execle' has the attribute set with a position of 1.

     A valid 'NULL' in this context is defined as zero with any pointer
     type.  If your system defines the 'NULL' macro with an integer type
     then you need to add an explicit cast.  GCC replaces 'stddef.h'
     with a copy that redefines NULL appropriately.

     The warnings for missing or incorrect sentinels are enabled with
     '-Wformat'.

'short_call'
     See 'long_call/short_call'.

'shortcall'
     See 'longcall/shortcall'.

'signal'
     Use this attribute on the AVR to indicate that the specified
     function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler generates function
     entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler
     when this attribute is present.

     See also the 'interrupt' function attribute.

     The AVR hardware globally disables interrupts when an interrupt is
     executed.  Interrupt handler functions defined with the 'signal'
     attribute do not re-enable interrupts.  It is save to enable
     interrupts in a 'signal' handler.  This "save" only applies to the
     code generated by the compiler and not to the IRQ layout of the
     application which is responsibility of the application.

     If both 'signal' and 'interrupt' are specified for the same
     function, 'signal' is silently ignored.

'sp_switch'
     Use this attribute on the SH to indicate an 'interrupt_handler'
     function should switch to an alternate stack.  It expects a string
     argument that names a global variable holding the address of the
     alternate stack.

          void *alt_stack;
          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt_handler,
                                    sp_switch ("alt_stack")));

'stdcall'
     On the Intel 386, the 'stdcall' attribute causes the compiler to
     assume that the called function pops off the stack space used to
     pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.

'syscall_linkage'
     This attribute is used to modify the IA-64 calling convention by
     marking all input registers as live at all function exits.  This
     makes it possible to restart a system call after an interrupt
     without having to save/restore the input registers.  This also
     prevents kernel data from leaking into application code.

'target'
     The 'target' attribute is used to specify that a function is to be
     compiled with different target options than specified on the
     command line.  This can be used for instance to have functions
     compiled with a different ISA (instruction set architecture) than
     the default.  You can also use the '#pragma GCC target' pragma to
     set more than one function to be compiled with specific target
     options.  *Note Function Specific Option Pragmas::, for details
     about the '#pragma GCC target' pragma.

     For instance on a 386, you could compile one function with
     'target("sse4.1,arch=core2")' and another with
     'target("sse4a,arch=amdfam10")'.  This is equivalent to compiling
     the first function with '-msse4.1' and '-march=core2' options, and
     the second function with '-msse4a' and '-march=amdfam10' options.
     It is up to the user to make sure that a function is only invoked
     on a machine that supports the particular ISA it is compiled for
     (for example by using 'cpuid' on 386 to determine what feature bits
     and architecture family are used).

          int core2_func (void) __attribute__ ((__target__ ("arch=core2")));
          int sse3_func (void) __attribute__ ((__target__ ("sse3")));

     You can either use multiple strings to specify multiple options, or
     separate the options with a comma (',').

     The 'target' attribute is presently implemented for i386/x86_64,
     PowerPC, and Nios II targets only.  The options supported are
     specific to each target.

     On the 386, the following options are allowed:

     'abm'
     'no-abm'
          Enable/disable the generation of the advanced bit
          instructions.

     'no-sse4.1'
          Enable/disable the generation of the sse4.1 instructions.

     'sse4.2'

     'no-sse4a'
          Enable/disable the generation of the SSE4A instructions.

          Enable/disable the generation of the SSSE3 instructions.

     'cld'
     'no-cld'
          Enable/disable the generation of the CLD before string moves.

     'fancy-math-387'
     'no-fancy-math-387'
          Enable/disable the generation of the 'sin', 'cos', and 'sqrt'
          instructions on the 387 floating-point unit.

     'fused-madd'
     'no-fused-madd'
          Enable/disable the generation of the fused multiply/add
          instructions.

     'ieee-fp'
     'no-ieee-fp'
          Enable/disable the generation of floating point that depends
          on IEEE arithmetic.

     'inline-all-stringops'
     'no-inline-all-stringops'
          Enable/disable inlining of string operations.

     'inline-stringops-dynamically'
     'no-inline-stringops-dynamically'
          Enable/disable the generation of the inline code to do small
          string operations and calling the library routines for large
          operations.

     'align-stringops'
     'no-align-stringops'
          Do/do not align destination of inlined string operations.

     'recip'
     'no-recip'
          Enable/disable the generation of RCPSS, RCPPS, RSQRTSS and
          RSQRTPS instructions followed an additional Newton-Raphson
          step instead of doing a floating-point division.

     'arch=ARCH'
          Specify the architecture to generate code for in compiling the
          function.

     'tune=TUNE'
          Specify the architecture to tune for in compiling the
          function.

     'fpmath=FPMATH'
          Specify which floating-point unit to use.  The
          'target("fpmath=sse,387")' option must be specified as
          'target("fpmath=sse+387")' because the comma would separate
          different options.

     On the PowerPC, the following options are allowed:

     'altivec'
     'no-altivec'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions.
          In 32-bit code, you cannot enable AltiVec instructions unless
          '-mabi=altivec' is used on the command line.

     'cmpb'
     'no-cmpb'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the compare bytes
          instruction implemented on the POWER6 processor and other
          processors that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.

     'dlmzb'
     'no-dlmzb'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search
          'dlmzb' instruction on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476
          processors.  This instruction is generated by default when
          targeting those processors.

     'fprnd'
     'no-fprnd'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the FP round to integer
          instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other
          processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.

     'hard-dfp'
     'no-hard-dfp'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the decimal
          floating-point instructions implemented on some POWER
          processors.

     'isel'
     'no-isel'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) ISEL instruction.

     'mfcrf'
     'no-mfcrf'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the move from condition
          register field instruction implemented on the POWER4 processor
          and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
          architecture.

     'mfpgpr'
     'no-mfpgpr'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the FP move to/from
          general purpose register instructions implemented on the
          POWER6X processor and other processors that support the
          extended PowerPC V2.05 architecture.

     'mulhw'
     'no-mulhw'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply
          and multiply-accumulate instructions on the IBM 405, 440, 464
          and 476 processors.  These instructions are generated by
          default when targeting those processors.

     'multiple'
     'no-multiple'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
          instructions and the store multiple word instructions.

     'update'
     'no-update'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store
          instructions that update the base register to the address of
          the calculated memory location.

     'popcntb'
     'no-popcntb'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the popcount and
          double-precision FP reciprocal estimate instruction
          implemented on the POWER5 processor and other processors that
          support the PowerPC V2.02 architecture.

     'popcntd'
     'no-popcntd'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the popcount
          instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor and other
          processors that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.

     'powerpc-gfxopt'
     'no-powerpc-gfxopt'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the optional PowerPC
          architecture instructions in the Graphics group, including
          floating-point select.

     'powerpc-gpopt'
     'no-powerpc-gpopt'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the optional PowerPC
          architecture instructions in the General Purpose group,
          including floating-point square root.

     'recip-precision'
     'no-recip-precision'
          Assume (do not assume) that the reciprocal estimate
          instructions provide higher-precision estimates than is
          mandated by the powerpc ABI.

     'string'
     'no-string'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string
          instructions and the store string word instructions to save
          multiple registers and do small block moves.

     'vsx'
     'no-vsx'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) vector/scalar (VSX)
          instructions, and also enable the use of built-in functions
          that allow more direct access to the VSX instruction set.  In
          32-bit code, you cannot enable VSX or AltiVec instructions
          unless '-mabi=altivec' is used on the command line.

     'friz'
     'no-friz'
          Generate (do not generate) the 'friz' instruction when the
          '-funsafe-math-optimizations' option is used to optimize
          rounding a floating-point value to 64-bit integer and back to
          floating point.  The 'friz' instruction does not return the
          same value if the floating-point number is too large to fit in
          an integer.

     'avoid-indexed-addresses'
     'no-avoid-indexed-addresses'
          Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of
          indexed load or store instructions.

     'paired'
     'no-paired'
          Generate code that uses (does not use) the generation of
          PAIRED simd instructions.

     'longcall'
     'no-longcall'
          Generate code that assumes (does not assume) that all calls
          are far away so that a longer more expensive calling sequence
          is required.

     'cpu=CPU'
          Specify the architecture to generate code for when compiling
          the function.  If you select the 'target("cpu=power7")'
          attribute when generating 32-bit code, VSX and AltiVec
          instructions are not generated unless you use the
          '-mabi=altivec' option on the command line.

     'tune=TUNE'
          Specify the architecture to tune for when compiling the
          function.  If you do not specify the 'target("tune=TUNE")'
          attribute and you do specify the 'target("cpu=CPU")'
          attribute, compilation tunes for the CPU architecture, and not
          the default tuning specified on the command line.

     When compiling for Nios II, the following options are allowed:

     'custom-INSN=N'
     'no-custom-INSN'
          Each 'custom-INSN=N' attribute locally enables use of a custom
          instruction with encoding N when generating code that uses
          INSN.  Similarly, 'no-custom-INSN' locally inhibits use of the
          custom instruction INSN.  These target attributes correspond
          to the '-mcustom-INSN=N' and '-mno-custom-INSN' command-line
          options, and support the same set of INSN keywords.  *Note
          Nios II Options::, for more information.

     'custom-fpu-cfg=NAME'
          This attribute corresponds to the '-mcustom-fpu-cfg=NAME'
          command-line option, to select a predefined set of custom
          instructions named NAME.  *Note Nios II Options::, for more
          information.

     On the 386/x86_64 and PowerPC back ends, the inliner does not
     inline a function that has different target options than the
     caller, unless the callee has a subset of the target options of the
     caller.  For example a function declared with 'target("sse3")' can
     inline a function with 'target("sse2")', since '-msse3' implies
     '-msse2'.

'tiny_data'
     Use this attribute on the H8/300H and H8S to indicate that the
     specified variable should be placed into the tiny data section.
     The compiler generates more efficient code for loads and stores on
     data in the tiny data section.  Note the tiny data area is limited
     to slightly under 32KB of data.

'trap_exit'
     Use this attribute on the SH for an 'interrupt_handler' to return
     using 'trapa' instead of 'rte'.  This attribute expects an integer
     argument specifying the trap number to be used.

'trapa_handler'
     On SH targets this function attribute is similar to
     'interrupt_handler' but it does not save and restore all registers.

'unused'
     This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is
     meant to be possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for
     this function.

'used'
     This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be
     emitted for the function even if it appears that the function is
     not referenced.  This is useful, for example, when the function is
     referenced only in inline assembly.

     When applied to a member function of a C++ class template, the
     attribute also means that the function is instantiated if the class
     itself is instantiated.

'version_id'
     This IA-64 HP-UX attribute, attached to a global variable or
     function, renames a symbol to contain a version string, thus
     allowing for function level versioning.  HP-UX system header files
     may use function level versioning for some system calls.

          extern int foo () __attribute__((version_id ("20040821")));

     Calls to FOO are mapped to calls to FOO{20040821}.

'visibility ("VISIBILITY_TYPE")'
     This attribute affects the linkage of the declaration to which it
     is attached.  There are four supported VISIBILITY_TYPE values:
     default, hidden, protected or internal visibility.

          void __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
          f () { /* Do something. */; }
          int i __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")));

     The possible values of VISIBILITY_TYPE correspond to the visibility
     settings in the ELF gABI.

     "default"
          Default visibility is the normal case for the object file
          format.  This value is available for the visibility attribute
          to override other options that may change the assumed
          visibility of entities.

          On ELF, default visibility means that the declaration is
          visible to other modules and, in shared libraries, means that
          the declared entity may be overridden.

          On Darwin, default visibility means that the declaration is
          visible to other modules.

          Default visibility corresponds to "external linkage" in the
          language.

     "hidden"
          Hidden visibility indicates that the entity declared has a new
          form of linkage, which we call "hidden linkage".  Two
          declarations of an object with hidden linkage refer to the
          same object if they are in the same shared object.

     "internal"
          Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with
          additional processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise
          specified by the psABI, GCC defines internal visibility to
          mean that a function is _never_ called from another module.
          Compare this with hidden functions which, while they cannot be
          referenced directly by other modules, can be referenced
          indirectly via function pointers.  By indicating that a
          function cannot be called from outside the module, GCC may for
          instance omit the load of a PIC register since it is known
          that the calling function loaded the correct value.

     "protected"
          Protected visibility is like default visibility except that it
          indicates that references within the defining module bind to
          the definition in that module.  That is, the declared entity
          cannot be overridden by another module.

     All visibilities are supported on many, but not all, ELF targets
     (supported when the assembler supports the '.visibility'
     pseudo-op).  Default visibility is supported everywhere.  Hidden
     visibility is supported on Darwin targets.

     The visibility attribute should be applied only to declarations
     that would otherwise have external linkage.  The attribute should
     be applied consistently, so that the same entity should not be
     declared with different settings of the attribute.

     In C++, the visibility attribute applies to types as well as
     functions and objects, because in C++ types have linkage.  A class
     must not have greater visibility than its non-static data member
     types and bases, and class members default to the visibility of
     their class.  Also, a declaration without explicit visibility is
     limited to the visibility of its type.

     In C++, you can mark member functions and static member variables
     of a class with the visibility attribute.  This is useful if you
     know a particular method or static member variable should only be
     used from one shared object; then you can mark it hidden while the
     rest of the class has default visibility.  Care must be taken to
     avoid breaking the One Definition Rule; for example, it is usually
     not useful to mark an inline method as hidden without marking the
     whole class as hidden.

     A C++ namespace declaration can also have the visibility attribute.

          namespace nspace1 __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
          { /* Do something. */; }

     This attribute applies only to the particular namespace body, not
     to other definitions of the same namespace; it is equivalent to
     using '#pragma GCC visibility' before and after the namespace
     definition (*note Visibility Pragmas::).

     In C++, if a template argument has limited visibility, this
     restriction is implicitly propagated to the template instantiation.
     Otherwise, template instantiations and specializations default to
     the visibility of their template.

     If both the template and enclosing class have explicit visibility,
     the visibility from the template is used.

'vliw'
     On MeP, the 'vliw' attribute tells the compiler to emit
     instructions in VLIW mode instead of core mode.  Note that this
     attribute is not allowed unless a VLIW coprocessor has been
     configured and enabled through command-line options.

'warn_unused_result'
     The 'warn_unused_result' attribute causes a warning to be emitted
     if a caller of the function with this attribute does not use its
     return value.  This is useful for functions where not checking the
     result is either a security problem or always a bug, such as
     'realloc'.

          int fn () __attribute__ ((warn_unused_result));
          int foo ()
          {
            if (fn () < 0) return -1;
            fn ();
            return 0;
          }

     results in warning on line 5.

'weak'
     The 'weak' attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
     symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
     library functions that can be overridden in user code, though it
     can also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are
     supported for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using
     the GNU assembler and linker.

'weakref'
'weakref ("TARGET")'
     The 'weakref' attribute marks a declaration as a weak reference.
     Without arguments, it should be accompanied by an 'alias' attribute
     naming the target symbol.  Optionally, the TARGET may be given as
     an argument to 'weakref' itself.  In either case, 'weakref'
     implicitly marks the declaration as 'weak'.  Without a TARGET,
     given as an argument to 'weakref' or to 'alias', 'weakref' is
     equivalent to 'weak'.

          static int x() __attribute__ ((weakref ("y")));
          /* is equivalent to... */
          static int x() __attribute__ ((weak, weakref, alias ("y")));
          /* and to... */
          static int x() __attribute__ ((weakref));
          static int x() __attribute__ ((alias ("y")));

     A weak reference is an alias that does not by itself require a
     definition to be given for the target symbol.  If the target symbol
     is only referenced through weak references, then it becomes a
     'weak' undefined symbol.  If it is directly referenced, however,
     then such strong references prevail, and a definition is required
     for the symbol, not necessarily in the same translation unit.

     The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a
     separate translation unit, renaming the alias to the aliased
     symbol, declaring it as weak, compiling the two separate
     translation units and performing a reloadable link on them.

     At present, a declaration to which 'weakref' is attached can only
     be 'static'.

 You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating them
by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately following an
attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.

 Some people object to the '__attribute__' feature, suggesting that ISO
C's '#pragma' should be used instead.  At the time '__attribute__' was
designed, there were two reasons for not doing this.

  1. It is impossible to generate '#pragma' commands from a macro.

  2. There is no telling what the same '#pragma' might mean in another
     compiler.

 These two reasons applied to almost any application that might have
been proposed for '#pragma'.  It was basically a mistake to use
'#pragma' for _anything_.

 The ISO C99 standard includes '_Pragma', which now allows pragmas to be
generated from macros.  In addition, a '#pragma GCC' namespace is now in
use for GCC-specific pragmas.  However, it has been found convenient to
use '__attribute__' to achieve a natural attachment of attributes to
their corresponding declarations, whereas '#pragma GCC' is of use for
constructs that do not naturally form part of the grammar.  *Note
Pragmas Accepted by GCC: Pragmas.

6.31 Attribute Syntax
=====================

This section describes the syntax with which '__attribute__' may be
used, and the constructs to which attribute specifiers bind, for the C
language.  Some details may vary for C++ and Objective-C.  Because of
infelicities in the grammar for attributes, some forms described here
may not be successfully parsed in all cases.

 There are some problems with the semantics of attributes in C++.  For
example, there are no manglings for attributes, although they may affect
code generation, so problems may arise when attributed types are used in
conjunction with templates or overloading.  Similarly, 'typeid' does not
distinguish between types with different attributes.  Support for
attributes in C++ may be restricted in future to attributes on
declarations only, but not on nested declarators.

 *Note Function Attributes::, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to functions.  *Note Variable Attributes::, for details of the
semantics of attributes applying to variables.  *Note Type Attributes::,
for details of the semantics of attributes applying to structure, union
and enumerated types.

 An "attribute specifier" is of the form '__attribute__
((ATTRIBUTE-LIST))'.  An "attribute list" is a possibly empty
comma-separated sequence of "attributes", where each attribute is one of
the following:

   * Empty.  Empty attributes are ignored.

   * A word (which may be an identifier such as 'unused', or a reserved
     word such as 'const').

   * A word, followed by, in parentheses, parameters for the attribute.
     These parameters take one of the following forms:

        * An identifier.  For example, 'mode' attributes use this form.

        * An identifier followed by a comma and a non-empty
          comma-separated list of expressions.  For example, 'format'
          attributes use this form.

        * A possibly empty comma-separated list of expressions.  For
          example, 'format_arg' attributes use this form with the list
          being a single integer constant expression, and 'alias'
          attributes use this form with the list being a single string
          constant.

 An "attribute specifier list" is a sequence of one or more attribute
specifiers, not separated by any other tokens.

 In GNU C, an attribute specifier list may appear after the colon
following a label, other than a 'case' or 'default' label.  The only
attribute it makes sense to use after a label is 'unused'.  This feature
is intended for program-generated code that may contain unused labels,
but which is compiled with '-Wall'.  It is not normally appropriate to
use in it human-written code, though it could be useful in cases where
the code that jumps to the label is contained within an '#ifdef'
conditional.  GNU C++ only permits attributes on labels if the attribute
specifier is immediately followed by a semicolon (i.e., the label
applies to an empty statement).  If the semicolon is missing, C++ label
attributes are ambiguous, as it is permissible for a declaration, which
could begin with an attribute list, to be labelled in C++.  Declarations
cannot be labelled in C90 or C99, so the ambiguity does not arise there.

 An attribute specifier list may appear as part of a 'struct', 'union'
or 'enum' specifier.  It may go either immediately after the 'struct',
'union' or 'enum' keyword, or after the closing brace.  The former
syntax is preferred.  Where attribute specifiers follow the closing
brace, they are considered to relate to the structure, union or
enumerated type defined, not to any enclosing declaration the type
specifier appears in, and the type defined is not complete until after
the attribute specifiers.

 Otherwise, an attribute specifier appears as part of a declaration,
counting declarations of unnamed parameters and type names, and relates
to that declaration (which may be nested in another declaration, for
example in the case of a parameter declaration), or to a particular
declarator within a declaration.  Where an attribute specifier is
applied to a parameter declared as a function or an array, it should
apply to the function or array rather than the pointer to which the
parameter is implicitly converted, but this is not yet correctly
implemented.

 Any list of specifiers and qualifiers at the start of a declaration may
contain attribute specifiers, whether or not such a list may in that
context contain storage class specifiers.  (Some attributes, however,
are essentially in the nature of storage class specifiers, and only make
sense where storage class specifiers may be used; for example,
'section'.)  There is one necessary limitation to this syntax: the first
old-style parameter declaration in a function definition cannot begin
with an attribute specifier, because such an attribute applies to the
function instead by syntax described below (which, however, is not yet
implemented in this case).  In some other cases, attribute specifiers
are permitted by this grammar but not yet supported by the compiler.
All attribute specifiers in this place relate to the declaration as a
whole.  In the obsolescent usage where a type of 'int' is implied by the
absence of type specifiers, such a list of specifiers and qualifiers may
be an attribute specifier list with no other specifiers or qualifiers.

 At present, the first parameter in a function prototype must have some
type specifier that is not an attribute specifier; this resolves an
ambiguity in the interpretation of 'void f(int (__attribute__((foo))
x))', but is subject to change.  At present, if the parentheses of a
function declarator contain only attributes then those attributes are
ignored, rather than yielding an error or warning or implying a single
parameter of type int, but this is subject to change.

 An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before a declarator
(other than the first) in a comma-separated list of declarators in a
declaration of more than one identifier using a single list of
specifiers and qualifiers.  Such attribute specifiers apply only to the
identifier before whose declarator they appear.  For example, in

     __attribute__((noreturn)) void d0 (void),
         __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2))) d1 (const char *, ...),
          d2 (void)

the 'noreturn' attribute applies to all the functions declared; the
'format' attribute only applies to 'd1'.

 An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before the comma,
'=' or semicolon terminating the declaration of an identifier other than
a function definition.  Such attribute specifiers apply to the declared
object or function.  Where an assembler name for an object or function
is specified (*note Asm Labels::), the attribute must follow the 'asm'
specification.

 An attribute specifier list may, in future, be permitted to appear
after the declarator in a function definition (before any old-style
parameter declarations or the function body).

 Attribute specifiers may be mixed with type qualifiers appearing inside
the '[]' of a parameter array declarator, in the C99 construct by which
such qualifiers are applied to the pointer to which the array is
implicitly converted.  Such attribute specifiers apply to the pointer,
not to the array, but at present this is not implemented and they are
ignored.

 An attribute specifier list may appear at the start of a nested
declarator.  At present, there are some limitations in this usage: the
attributes correctly apply to the declarator, but for most individual
attributes the semantics this implies are not implemented.  When
attribute specifiers follow the '*' of a pointer declarator, they may be
mixed with any type qualifiers present.  The following describes the
formal semantics of this syntax.  It makes the most sense if you are
familiar with the formal specification of declarators in the ISO C
standard.

 Consider (as in C99 subclause 6.7.5 paragraph 4) a declaration 'T D1',
where 'T' contains declaration specifiers that specify a type TYPE (such
as 'int') and 'D1' is a declarator that contains an identifier IDENT.
The type specified for IDENT for derived declarators whose type does not
include an attribute specifier is as in the ISO C standard.

 If 'D1' has the form '( ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIER-LIST D )', and the
declaration 'T D' specifies the type "DERIVED-DECLARATOR-TYPE-LIST TYPE"
for IDENT, then 'T D1' specifies the type "DERIVED-DECLARATOR-TYPE-LIST
ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIER-LIST TYPE" for IDENT.

 If 'D1' has the form '* TYPE-QUALIFIER-AND-ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIER-LIST D',
and the declaration 'T D' specifies the type
"DERIVED-DECLARATOR-TYPE-LIST TYPE" for IDENT, then 'T D1' specifies the
type "DERIVED-DECLARATOR-TYPE-LIST
TYPE-QUALIFIER-AND-ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIER-LIST pointer to TYPE" for IDENT.

 For example,

     void (__attribute__((noreturn)) ****f) (void);

specifies the type "pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to
non-returning function returning 'void'".  As another example,

     char *__attribute__((aligned(8))) *f;

specifies the type "pointer to 8-byte-aligned pointer to 'char'".  Note
again that this does not work with most attributes; for example, the
usage of 'aligned' and 'noreturn' attributes given above is not yet
supported.

 For compatibility with existing code written for compiler versions that
did not implement attributes on nested declarators, some laxity is
allowed in the placing of attributes.  If an attribute that only applies
to types is applied to a declaration, it is treated as applying to the
type of that declaration.  If an attribute that only applies to
declarations is applied to the type of a declaration, it is treated as
applying to that declaration; and, for compatibility with code placing
the attributes immediately before the identifier declared, such an
attribute applied to a function return type is treated as applying to
the function type, and such an attribute applied to an array element
type is treated as applying to the array type.  If an attribute that
only applies to function types is applied to a pointer-to-function type,
it is treated as applying to the pointer target type; if such an
attribute is applied to a function return type that is not a
pointer-to-function type, it is treated as applying to the function
type.

6.32 Prototypes and Old-Style Function Definitions
==================================================

GNU C extends ISO C to allow a function prototype to override a later
old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following example:

     /* Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.  */
     #ifdef __STDC__
     #define P(x) x
     #else
     #define P(x) ()
     #endif

     /* Prototype function declaration.  */
     int isroot P((uid_t));

     /* Old-style function definition.  */
     int
     isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
          uid_t x;
     {
       return x == 0;
     }

 Suppose the type 'uid_t' happens to be 'short'.  ISO C does not allow
this example, because subword arguments in old-style non-prototype
definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the function
definition's argument is really an 'int', which does not match the
prototype argument type of 'short'.

 This restriction of ISO C makes it hard to write code that is portable
to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not know whether
the 'uid_t' type is 'short', 'int', or 'long'.  Therefore, in cases like
these GNU C allows a prototype to override a later old-style definition.
More precisely, in GNU C, a function prototype argument type overrides
the argument type specified by a later old-style definition if the
former type is the same as the latter type before promotion.  Thus in
GNU C the above example is equivalent to the following:

     int isroot (uid_t);

     int
     isroot (uid_t x)
     {
       return x == 0;
     }

GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
extension is irrelevant.

6.33 C++ Style Comments
=======================

In GNU C, you may use C++ style comments, which start with '//' and
continue until the end of the line.  Many other C implementations allow
such comments, and they are included in the 1999 C standard.  However,
C++ style comments are not recognized if you specify an '-std' option
specifying a version of ISO C before C99, or '-ansi' (equivalent to
'-std=c90').

6.34 Dollar Signs in Identifier Names
=====================================

In GNU C, you may normally use dollar signs in identifier names.  This
is because many traditional C implementations allow such identifiers.
However, dollar signs in identifiers are not supported on a few target
machines, typically because the target assembler does not allow them.

6.36 Specifying Attributes of Variables
=======================================

The keyword '__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes of
variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed by an attribute
specification inside double parentheses.  Some attributes are currently
defined generically for variables.  Other attributes are defined for
variables on particular target systems.  Other attributes are available
for functions (*note Function Attributes::) and for types (*note Type
Attributes::).  Other front ends might define more attributes (*note
Extensions to the C++ Language: C++ Extensions.).

 You may also specify attributes with '__' preceding and following each
keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without being
concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example, you may
use '__aligned__' instead of 'aligned'.

 *Note Attribute Syntax::, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

'aligned (ALIGNMENT)'
     This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
     structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

          int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;

     causes the compiler to allocate the global variable 'x' on a
     16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction
     with an 'asm' expression to access the 'move16' instruction which
     requires 16-byte aligned operands.

     You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For
     example, to create a double-word aligned 'int' pair, you could
     write:

          struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };

     This is an alternative to creating a union with a 'double' member,
     which forces the union to be double-word aligned.

     As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the
     alignment (in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given
     variable or structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the
     alignment factor and just ask the compiler to align a variable or
     field to the default alignment for the target architecture you are
     compiling for.  The default alignment is sufficient for all scalar
     types, but may not be enough for all vector types on a target that
     supports vector operations.  The default alignment is fixed for a
     particular target ABI.

     GCC also provides a target specific macro '__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__',
     which is the largest alignment ever used for any data type on the
     target machine you are compiling for.  For example, you could
     write:

          short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned (__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__)));

     The compiler automatically sets the alignment for the declared
     variable or field to '__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__'.  Doing this can often
     make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
     whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when
     performing copies to or from the variables or fields that you have
     aligned this way.  Note that the value of '__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__'
     may change depending on command-line options.

     When used on a struct, or struct member, the 'aligned' attribute
     can only increase the alignment; in order to decrease it, the
     'packed' attribute must be specified as well.  When used as part of
     a typedef, the 'aligned' attribute can both increase and decrease
     alignment, and specifying the 'packed' attribute generates a
     warning.

     Note that the effectiveness of 'aligned' attributes may be limited
     by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
     linker is only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a
     certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum
     supported alignment may be very very small.)  If your linker is
     only able to align variables up to a maximum of 8-byte alignment,
     then specifying 'aligned(16)' in an '__attribute__' still only
     provides you with 8-byte alignment.  See your linker documentation
     for further information.

     The 'aligned' attribute can also be used for functions (*note
     Function Attributes::.)

'cleanup (CLEANUP_FUNCTION)'
     The 'cleanup' attribute runs a function when the variable goes out
     of scope.  This attribute can only be applied to auto function
     scope variables; it may not be applied to parameters or variables
     with static storage duration.  The function must take one
     parameter, a pointer to a type compatible with the variable.  The
     return value of the function (if any) is ignored.

     If '-fexceptions' is enabled, then CLEANUP_FUNCTION is run during
     the stack unwinding that happens during the processing of the
     exception.  Note that the 'cleanup' attribute does not allow the
     exception to be caught, only to perform an action.  It is undefined
     what happens if CLEANUP_FUNCTION does not return normally.

'common'
'nocommon'
     The 'common' attribute requests GCC to place a variable in "common"
     storage.  The 'nocommon' attribute requests the opposite--to
     allocate space for it directly.

     These attributes override the default chosen by the '-fno-common'
     and '-fcommon' flags respectively.

'deprecated'
'deprecated (MSG)'
     The 'deprecated' attribute results in a warning if the variable is
     used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
     variables that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
     program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
     of the deprecated variable, to enable users to easily find further
     information about why the variable is deprecated, or what they
     should do instead.  Note that the warning only occurs for uses:

          extern int old_var __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          extern int old_var;
          int new_fn () { return old_var; }

     results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.  The optional MSG
     argument, which must be a string, is printed in the warning if
     present.

     The 'deprecated' attribute can also be used for functions and types
     (*note Function Attributes::, *note Type Attributes::.)

'mode (MODE)'
     This attribute specifies the data type for the
     declaration--whichever type corresponds to the mode MODE.  This in
     effect lets you request an integer or floating-point type according
     to its width.

     You may also specify a mode of 'byte' or '__byte__' to indicate the
     mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, 'word' or '__word__' for
     the mode of a one-word integer, and 'pointer' or '__pointer__' for
     the mode used to represent pointers.

'packed'
     The 'packed' attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
     should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a
     variable, and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger
     value with the 'aligned' attribute.

     Here is a structure in which the field 'x' is packed, so that it
     immediately follows 'a':

          struct foo
          {
            char a;
            int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
          };

     _Note:_ The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the 'packed'
     attribute on bit-fields of type 'char'.  This has been fixed in GCC
     4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.
     See the documentation of '-Wpacked-bitfield-compat' for more
     information.

'section ("SECTION-NAME")'
     Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections
     like 'data' and 'bss'.  Sometimes, however, you need additional
     sections, or you need certain particular variables to appear in
     special sections, for example to map to special hardware.  The
     'section' attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives
     in a particular section.  For example, this small program uses
     several specific section names:

          struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
          struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
          char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
          int init_data __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATA")));

          main()
          {
            /* Initialize stack pointer */
            init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));

            /* Initialize initialized data */
            memcpy (&init_data, &data, &edata - &data);

            /* Turn on the serial ports */
            init_duart (&a);
            init_duart (&b);
          }

     Use the 'section' attribute with _global_ variables and not _local_
     variables, as shown in the example.

     You may use the 'section' attribute with initialized or
     uninitialized global variables but the linker requires each object
     be defined once, with the exception that uninitialized variables
     tentatively go in the 'common' (or 'bss') section and can be
     multiply "defined".  Using the 'section' attribute changes what
     section the variable goes into and may cause the linker to issue an
     error if an uninitialized variable has multiple definitions.  You
     can force a variable to be initialized with the '-fno-common' flag
     or the 'nocommon' attribute.

     Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the
     'section' attribute is not available on all platforms.  If you need
     to map the entire contents of a module to a particular section,
     consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

'shared'
     On Microsoft Windows, in addition to putting variable definitions
     in a named section, the section can also be shared among all
     running copies of an executable or DLL.  For example, this small
     program defines shared data by putting it in a named section
     'shared' and marking the section shareable:

          int foo __attribute__((section ("shared"), shared)) = 0;

          int
          main()
          {
            /* Read and write foo.  All running
               copies see the same value.  */
            return 0;
          }

     You may only use the 'shared' attribute along with 'section'
     attribute with a fully-initialized global definition because of the
     way linkers work.  See 'section' attribute for more information.

     The 'shared' attribute is only available on Microsoft Windows.

'tls_model ("TLS_MODEL")'
     The 'tls_model' attribute sets thread-local storage model (*note
     Thread-Local::) of a particular '__thread' variable, overriding
     '-ftls-model=' command-line switch on a per-variable basis.  The
     TLS_MODEL argument should be one of 'global-dynamic',
     'local-dynamic', 'initial-exec' or 'local-exec'.

     Not all targets support this attribute.

'unused'
     This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is
     meant to be possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for
     this variable.

'used'
     This attribute, attached to a variable with the static storage,
     means that the variable must be emitted even if it appears that the
     variable is not referenced.

     When applied to a static data member of a C++ class template, the
     attribute also means that the member is instantiated if the class
     itself is instantiated.

'vector_size (BYTES)'
     This attribute specifies the vector size for the variable, measured
     in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

          int foo __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

     causes the compiler to set the mode for 'foo', to be 16 bytes,
     divided into 'int' sized units.  Assuming a 32-bit int (a vector of
     4 units of 4 bytes), the corresponding mode of 'foo' is V4SI.

     This attribute is only applicable to integral and float scalars,
     although arrays, pointers, and function return values are allowed
     in conjunction with this construct.

     Aggregates with this attribute are invalid, even if they are of the
     same size as a corresponding scalar.  For example, the declaration:

          struct S { int a; };
          struct S  __attribute__ ((vector_size (16))) foo;

     is invalid even if the size of the structure is the same as the
     size of the 'int'.

'selectany'
     The 'selectany' attribute causes an initialized global variable to
     have link-once semantics.  When multiple definitions of the
     variable are encountered by the linker, the first is selected and
     the remainder are discarded.  Following usage by the Microsoft
     compiler, the linker is told _not_ to warn about size or content
     differences of the multiple definitions.

     Although the primary usage of this attribute is for POD types, the
     attribute can also be applied to global C++ objects that are
     initialized by a constructor.  In this case, the static
     initialization and destruction code for the object is emitted in
     each translation defining the object, but the calls to the
     constructor and destructor are protected by a link-once guard
     variable.

     The 'selectany' attribute is only available on Microsoft Windows
     targets.  You can use '__declspec (selectany)' as a synonym for
     '__attribute__ ((selectany))' for compatibility with other
     compilers.

'weak'
     The 'weak' attribute is described in *note Function Attributes::.

'dllimport'
     The 'dllimport' attribute is described in *note Function
     Attributes::.

'dllexport'
     The 'dllexport' attribute is described in *note Function
     Attributes::.

6.36.1 AVR Variable Attributes
------------------------------

'progmem'
     The 'progmem' attribute is used on the AVR to place read-only data
     in the non-volatile program memory (flash).  The 'progmem'
     attribute accomplishes this by putting respective variables into a
     section whose name starts with '.progmem'.

     This attribute works similar to the 'section' attribute but adds
     additional checking.  Notice that just like the 'section'
     attribute, 'progmem' affects the location of the data but not how
     this data is accessed.

     In order to read data located with the 'progmem' attribute (inline)
     assembler must be used.
          /* Use custom macros from AVR-LibC (http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/) */
          #include <avr/pgmspace.h>

          /* Locate var in flash memory */
          const int var[2] PROGMEM = { 1, 2 };

          int read_var (int i)
          {
              /* Access var[] by accessor macro from avr/pgmspace.h */
              return (int) pgm_read_word (& var[i]);
          }

     AVR is a Harvard architecture processor and data and read-only data
     normally resides in the data memory (RAM).

     See also the *note AVR Named Address Spaces:: section for an
     alternate way to locate and access data in flash memory.

6.36.2 Blackfin Variable Attributes
-----------------------------------

Three attributes are currently defined for the Blackfin.

'l1_data'
'l1_data_A'
'l1_data_B'
     Use these attributes on the Blackfin to place the variable into L1
     Data SRAM. Variables with 'l1_data' attribute are put into the
     specific section named '.l1.data'.  Those with 'l1_data_A'
     attribute are put into the specific section named '.l1.data.A'.
     Those with 'l1_data_B' attribute are put into the specific section
     named '.l1.data.B'.

'l2'
     Use this attribute on the Blackfin to place the variable into L2
     SRAM. Variables with 'l2' attribute are put into the specific
     section named '.l2.data'.

6.36.3 M32R/D Variable Attributes
---------------------------------

One attribute is currently defined for the M32R/D.

'model (MODEL-NAME)'
     Use this attribute on the M32R/D to set the addressability of an
     object.  The identifier MODEL-NAME is one of 'small', 'medium', or
     'large', representing each of the code models.

     Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
     addresses can be loaded with the 'ld24' instruction).

     Medium and large model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit
     address space (the compiler generates 'seth/add3' instructions to
     load their addresses).

6.36.4 MeP Variable Attributes
------------------------------

The MeP target has a number of addressing modes and busses.  The 'near'
space spans the standard memory space's first 16 megabytes (24 bits).
The 'far' space spans the entire 32-bit memory space.  The 'based' space
is a 128-byte region in the memory space that is addressed relative to
the '$tp' register.  The 'tiny' space is a 65536-byte region relative to
the '$gp' register.  In addition to these memory regions, the MeP target
has a separate 16-bit control bus which is specified with 'cb'
attributes.

'based'
     Any variable with the 'based' attribute is assigned to the '.based'
     section, and is accessed with relative to the '$tp' register.

'tiny'
     Likewise, the 'tiny' attribute assigned variables to the '.tiny'
     section, relative to the '$gp' register.

'near'
     Variables with the 'near' attribute are assumed to have addresses
     that fit in a 24-bit addressing mode.  This is the default for
     large variables ('-mtiny=4' is the default) but this attribute can
     override '-mtiny=' for small variables, or override '-ml'.

'far'
     Variables with the 'far' attribute are addressed using a full
     32-bit address.  Since this covers the entire memory space, this
     allows modules to make no assumptions about where variables might
     be stored.

'io'
'io (ADDR)'
     Variables with the 'io' attribute are used to address memory-mapped
     peripherals.  If an address is specified, the variable is assigned
     that address, else it is not assigned an address (it is assumed
     some other module assigns an address).  Example:

          int timer_count __attribute__((io(0x123)));

'cb'
'cb (ADDR)'
     Variables with the 'cb' attribute are used to access the control
     bus, using special instructions.  'addr' indicates the control bus
     address.  Example:

          int cpu_clock __attribute__((cb(0x123)));

6.36.5 i386 Variable Attributes
-------------------------------

Two attributes are currently defined for i386 configurations:
'ms_struct' and 'gcc_struct'

'ms_struct'
'gcc_struct'

     If 'packed' is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used, it
     may be that the Microsoft ABI lays out the structure differently
     than the way GCC normally does.  Particularly when moving packed
     data between functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft
     compiler (either via function call or as data in a file), it may be
     necessary to access either format.

     Currently '-m[no-]ms-bitfields' is provided for the Microsoft
     Windows X86 compilers to match the native Microsoft compiler.

     The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple with the
     exception of the bit-field packing.  The padding and alignment of
     members of structures and whether a bit-field can straddle a
     storage-unit boundary are determine by these rules:

       1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in
          which they are declared: the first member has the lowest
          memory address and the last member the highest.

       2. Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The alignment
          requirement for all data except structures, unions, and arrays
          is either the size of the object or the current packing size
          (specified with either the 'aligned' attribute or the 'pack'
          pragma), whichever is less.  For structures, unions, and
          arrays, the alignment requirement is the largest alignment
          requirement of its members.  Every object is allocated an
          offset so that:

               offset % alignment_requirement == 0

       3. Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte
          allocation unit if the integral types are the same size and if
          the next bit-field fits into the current allocation unit
          without crossing the boundary imposed by the common alignment
          requirements of the bit-fields.

     MSVC interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:

       1. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted between two bit-fields
          that are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced.

          For example:

               struct
                {
                  unsigned long bf_1 : 12;
                  unsigned long : 0;
                  unsigned long bf_2 : 12;
                } t1;

          The size of 't1' is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-field.
          If the zero-length bit-field were removed, 't1''s size would
          be 4 bytes.

       2. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted after a bit-field,
          'foo', and the alignment of the zero-length bit-field is
          greater than the member that follows it, 'bar', 'bar' is
          aligned as the type of the zero-length bit-field.

          For example:

               struct
                {
                  char foo : 4;
                  short : 0;
                  char bar;
                } t2;

               struct
                {
                  char foo : 4;
                  short : 0;
                  double bar;
                } t3;

          For 't2', 'bar' is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1.
          Accordingly, the size of 't2' is 4.  For 't3', the zero-length
          bit-field does not affect the alignment of 'bar' or, as a
          result, the size of the structure.

          Taking this into account, it is important to note the
          following:

            1. If a zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field,
               the type of the zero-length bit-field may affect the
               alignment of the structure as whole.  For example, 't2'
               has a size of 4 bytes, since the zero-length bit-field
               follows a normal bit-field, and is of type short.

            2. Even if a zero-length bit-field is not followed by a
               normal bit-field, it may still affect the alignment of
               the structure:

                    struct
                     {
                       char foo : 6;
                       long : 0;
                     } t4;

               Here, 't4' takes up 4 bytes.

       3. Zero-length bit-fields following non-bit-field members are
          ignored:

               struct
                {
                  char foo;
                  long : 0;
                  char bar;
                } t5;

          Here, 't5' takes up 2 bytes.

6.36.6 PowerPC Variable Attributes
----------------------------------

Three attributes currently are defined for PowerPC configurations:
'altivec', 'ms_struct' and 'gcc_struct'.

 For full documentation of the struct attributes please see the
documentation in *note i386 Variable Attributes::.

 For documentation of 'altivec' attribute please see the documentation
in *note PowerPC Type Attributes::.

6.36.7 SPU Variable Attributes
------------------------------

The SPU supports the 'spu_vector' attribute for variables.  For
documentation of this attribute please see the documentation in *note
SPU Type Attributes::.

6.36.8 Xstormy16 Variable Attributes
------------------------------------

One attribute is currently defined for xstormy16 configurations:
'below100'.

'below100'

     If a variable has the 'below100' attribute ('BELOW100' is allowed
     also), GCC places the variable in the first 0x100 bytes of memory
     and use special opcodes to access it.  Such variables are placed in
     either the '.bss_below100' section or the '.data_below100' section.

6.37 Specifying Attributes of Types
===================================

The keyword '__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes of
'struct' and 'union' types when you define such types.  This keyword is
followed by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Seven
attributes are currently defined for types: 'aligned', 'packed',
'transparent_union', 'unused', 'deprecated', 'visibility', and
'may_alias'.  Other attributes are defined for functions (*note Function
Attributes::) and for variables (*note Variable Attributes::).

 You may also specify any one of these attributes with '__' preceding
and following its keyword.  This allows you to use these attributes in
header files without being concerned about a possible macro of the same
name.  For example, you may use '__aligned__' instead of 'aligned'.

 You may specify type attributes in an enum, struct or union type
declaration or definition, or for other types in a 'typedef'
declaration.

 For an enum, struct or union type, you may specify attributes either
between the enum, struct or union tag and the name of the type, or just
past the closing curly brace of the _definition_.  The former syntax is
preferred.

 *Note Attribute Syntax::, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

'aligned (ALIGNMENT)'
     This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for
     variables of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:

          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
          typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));

     force the compiler to ensure (as far as it can) that each variable
     whose type is 'struct S' or 'more_aligned_int' is allocated and
     aligned _at least_ on a 8-byte boundary.  On a SPARC, having all
     variables of type 'struct S' aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
     the compiler to use the 'ldd' and 'std' (doubleword load and store)
     instructions when copying one variable of type 'struct S' to
     another, thus improving run-time efficiency.

     Note that the alignment of any given 'struct' or 'union' type is
     required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
     the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members
     of the 'struct' or 'union' in question.  This means that you _can_
     effectively adjust the alignment of a 'struct' or 'union' type by
     attaching an 'aligned' attribute to any one of the members of such
     a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a more
     obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
     adjust the alignment of an entire 'struct' or 'union' type.

     As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the
     alignment (in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given
     'struct' or 'union' type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the
     alignment factor and just ask the compiler to align a type to the
     maximum useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling
     for.  For example, you could write:

          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));

     Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an 'aligned'
     attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the
     alignment for the type to the largest alignment that is ever used
     for any data type on the target machine you are compiling for.
     Doing this can often make copy operations more efficient, because
     the compiler can use whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks
     of memory when performing copies to or from the variables that have
     types that you have aligned this way.

     In the example above, if the size of each 'short' is 2 bytes, then
     the size of the entire 'struct S' type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
     power of two that is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
     compiler sets the alignment for the entire 'struct S' type to 8
     bytes.

     Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a
     time-efficient alignment for a given type and then declare only
     individual stand-alone objects of that type, the compiler's ability
     to select a time-efficient alignment is primarily useful only when
     you plan to create arrays of variables having the relevant
     (efficiently aligned) type.  If you declare or use arrays of
     variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then it is likely that
     your program also does pointer arithmetic (or subscripting, which
     amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the relevant type, and
     the code that the compiler generates for these pointer arithmetic
     operations is often more efficient for efficiently-aligned types
     than for other types.

     The 'aligned' attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
     can decrease it by specifying 'packed' as well.  See below.

     Note that the effectiveness of 'aligned' attributes may be limited
     by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the
     linker is only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a
     certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum
     supported alignment may be very very small.)  If your linker is
     only able to align variables up to a maximum of 8-byte alignment,
     then specifying 'aligned(16)' in an '__attribute__' still only
     provides you with 8-byte alignment.  See your linker documentation
     for further information.

'packed'
     This attribute, attached to 'struct' or 'union' type definition,
     specifies that each member (other than zero-width bit-fields) of
     the structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required.
     When attached to an 'enum' definition, it indicates that the
     smallest integral type should be used.

     Specifying this attribute for 'struct' and 'union' types is
     equivalent to specifying the 'packed' attribute on each of the
     structure or union members.  Specifying the '-fshort-enums' flag on
     the line is equivalent to specifying the 'packed' attribute on all
     'enum' definitions.

     In the following example 'struct my_packed_struct''s members are
     packed closely together, but the internal layout of its 's' member
     is not packed--to do that, 'struct my_unpacked_struct' needs to be
     packed too.

          struct my_unpacked_struct
           {
              char c;
              int i;
           };

          struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) my_packed_struct
            {
               char c;
               int  i;
               struct my_unpacked_struct s;
            };

     You may only specify this attribute on the definition of an 'enum',
     'struct' or 'union', not on a 'typedef' that does not also define
     the enumerated type, structure or union.

'transparent_union'
     This attribute, attached to a 'union' type definition, indicates
     that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to
     that function to be treated in a special way.

     First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can
     be of any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the
     union contains a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a
     null pointer constant or a void pointer expression; and if the
     union contains a void pointer type, the corresponding argument can
     be any pointer expression.  If the union member type is a pointer,
     qualifiers like 'const' on the referenced type must be respected,
     just as with normal pointer conversions.

     Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
     conventions of the first member of the transparent union, not the
     calling conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union
     must have the same machine representation; this is necessary for
     this argument passing to work properly.

     Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have
     multiple interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example,
     suppose the 'wait' function must accept either a value of type 'int
     *' to comply with POSIX, or a value of type 'union wait *' to
     comply with the 4.1BSD interface.  If 'wait''s parameter were 'void
     *', 'wait' would accept both kinds of arguments, but it would also
     accept any other pointer type and this would make argument type
     checking less useful.  Instead, '<sys/wait.h>' might define the
     interface as follows:

          typedef union __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__))
            {
              int *__ip;
              union wait *__up;
            } wait_status_ptr_t;

          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);

     This interface allows either 'int *' or 'union wait *' arguments to
     be passed, using the 'int *' calling convention.  The program can
     call 'wait' with arguments of either type:

          int w1 () { int w; return wait (&w); }
          int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&w); }

     With this interface, 'wait''s implementation might look like this:

          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
          {
            return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
          }

'unused'
     When attached to a type (including a 'union' or a 'struct'), this
     attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
     possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for any variables
     of that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.  This is
     often the case with lock or thread classes, which are usually
     defined and then not referenced, but contain constructors and
     destructors that have nontrivial bookkeeping functions.

'deprecated'
'deprecated (MSG)'
     The 'deprecated' attribute results in a warning if the type is used
     anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying types
     that are expected to be removed in a future version of a program.
     If possible, the warning also includes the location of the
     declaration of the deprecated type, to enable users to easily find
     further information about why the type is deprecated, or what they
     should do instead.  Note that the warnings only occur for uses and
     then only if the type is being applied to an identifier that itself
     is not being declared as deprecated.

          typedef int T1 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T1 x;
          typedef T1 T2;
          T2 y;
          typedef T1 T3 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T3 z __attribute__ ((deprecated));

     results in a warning on line 2 and 3 but not lines 4, 5, or 6.  No
     warning is issued for line 4 because T2 is not explicitly
     deprecated.  Line 5 has no warning because T3 is explicitly
     deprecated.  Similarly for line 6.  The optional MSG argument,
     which must be a string, is printed in the warning if present.

     The 'deprecated' attribute can also be used for functions and
     variables (*note Function Attributes::, *note Variable
     Attributes::.)

'may_alias'
     Accesses through pointers to types with this attribute are not
     subject to type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to be
     able to alias any other type of objects.  In the context of section
     6.5 paragraph 7 of the C99 standard, an lvalue expression
     dereferencing such a pointer is treated like having a character
     type.  See '-fstrict-aliasing' for more information on aliasing
     issues.  This extension exists to support some vector APIs, in
     which pointers to one vector type are permitted to alias pointers
     to a different vector type.

     Note that an object of a type with this attribute does not have any
     special semantics.

     Example of use:

          typedef short __attribute__((__may_alias__)) short_a;

          int
          main (void)
          {
            int a = 0x12345678;
            short_a *b = (short_a *) &a;

            b[1] = 0;

            if (a == 0x12345678)
              abort();

            exit(0);
          }

     If you replaced 'short_a' with 'short' in the variable declaration,
     the above program would abort when compiled with
     '-fstrict-aliasing', which is on by default at '-O2' or above in
     recent GCC versions.

'visibility'
     In C++, attribute visibility (*note Function Attributes::) can also
     be applied to class, struct, union and enum types.  Unlike other
     type attributes, the attribute must appear between the initial
     keyword and the name of the type; it cannot appear after the body
     of the type.

     Note that the type visibility is applied to vague linkage entities
     associated with the class (vtable, typeinfo node, etc.).  In
     particular, if a class is thrown as an exception in one shared
     object and caught in another, the class must have default
     visibility.  Otherwise the two shared objects are unable to use the
     same typeinfo node and exception handling will break.

 To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, '__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))'.

6.37.1 ARM Type Attributes
--------------------------

On those ARM targets that support 'dllimport' (such as Symbian OS), you
can use the 'notshared' attribute to indicate that the virtual table and
other similar data for a class should not be exported from a DLL.  For
example:

     class __declspec(notshared) C {
     public:
       __declspec(dllimport) C();
       virtual void f();
     }

     __declspec(dllexport)
     C::C() {}

In this code, 'C::C' is exported from the current DLL, but the virtual
table for 'C' is not exported.  (You can use '__attribute__' instead of
'__declspec' if you prefer, but most Symbian OS code uses '__declspec'.)

6.37.2 MeP Type Attributes
--------------------------

Many of the MeP variable attributes may be applied to types as well.
Specifically, the 'based', 'tiny', 'near', and 'far' attributes may be
applied to either.  The 'io' and 'cb' attributes may not be applied to
types.

6.37.3 i386 Type Attributes
---------------------------

Two attributes are currently defined for i386 configurations:
'ms_struct' and 'gcc_struct'.

'ms_struct'
'gcc_struct'

     If 'packed' is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are used it
     may be that the Microsoft ABI packs them differently than GCC
     normally packs them.  Particularly when moving packed data between
     functions compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler
     (either via function call or as data in a file), it may be
     necessary to access either format.

     Currently '-m[no-]ms-bitfields' is provided for the Microsoft
     Windows X86 compilers to match the native Microsoft compiler.

6.37.4 PowerPC Type Attributes
------------------------------

Three attributes currently are defined for PowerPC configurations:
'altivec', 'ms_struct' and 'gcc_struct'.

 For full documentation of the 'ms_struct' and 'gcc_struct' attributes
please see the documentation in *note i386 Type Attributes::.

 The 'altivec' attribute allows one to declare AltiVec vector data types
supported by the AltiVec Programming Interface Manual.  The attribute
requires an argument to specify one of three vector types: 'vector__',
'pixel__' (always followed by unsigned short), and 'bool__' (always
followed by unsigned).

     __attribute__((altivec(vector__)))
     __attribute__((altivec(pixel__))) unsigned short
     __attribute__((altivec(bool__))) unsigned

 These attributes mainly are intended to support the '__vector',
'__pixel', and '__bool' AltiVec keywords.

6.37.5 SPU Type Attributes
--------------------------

The SPU supports the 'spu_vector' attribute for types.  This attribute
allows one to declare vector data types supported by the
Sony/Toshiba/IBM SPU Language Extensions Specification.  It is intended
to support the '__vector' keyword.

6.38 Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables
=================================================

The keyword '__alignof__' allows you to inquire about how an object is
aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like 'sizeof'.

 For example, if the target machine requires a 'double' value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then '__alignof__ (double)' is 8.  This
is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine designs,
'__alignof__ (double)' is 4 or even 2.

 Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to
any data type even at an odd address.  For these machines, '__alignof__'
reports the smallest alignment that GCC gives the data type, usually as
mandated by the target ABI.

 If the operand of '__alignof__' is an lvalue rather than a type, its
value is the required alignment for its type, taking into account any
minimum alignment specified with GCC's '__attribute__' extension (*note
Variable Attributes::).  For example, after this declaration:

     struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;

the value of '__alignof__ (foo1.y)' is 1, even though its actual
alignment is probably 2 or 4, the same as '__alignof__ (int)'.

 It is an error to ask for the alignment of an incomplete type.

6.39 An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro
=============================================

By declaring a function inline, you can direct GCC to make calls to that
function faster.  One way GCC can achieve this is to integrate that
function's code into the code for its callers.  This makes execution
faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in addition, if any of
the actual argument values are constant, their known values may permit
simplifications at compile time so that not all of the inline function's
code needs to be included.  The effect on code size is less predictable;
object code may be larger or smaller with function inlining, depending
on the particular case.  You can also direct GCC to try to integrate all
"simple enough" functions into their callers with the option
'-finline-functions'.

 GCC implements three different semantics of declaring a function
inline.  One is available with '-std=gnu89' or '-fgnu89-inline' or when
'gnu_inline' attribute is present on all inline declarations, another
when '-std=c99', '-std=c11', '-std=gnu99' or '-std=gnu11' (without
'-fgnu89-inline'), and the third is used when compiling C++.

 To declare a function inline, use the 'inline' keyword in its
declaration, like this:

     static inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       return (*a)++;
     }

 If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C90 programs,
write '__inline__' instead of 'inline'.  *Note Alternate Keywords::.

 The three types of inlining behave similarly in two important cases:
when the 'inline' keyword is used on a 'static' function, like the
example above, and when a function is first declared without using the
'inline' keyword and then is defined with 'inline', like this:

     extern int inc (int *a);
     inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       return (*a)++;
     }

 In both of these common cases, the program behaves the same as if you
had not used the 'inline' keyword, except for its speed.

 When a function is both inline and 'static', if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced.
In this case, GCC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option '-fkeep-inline-functions'.  Some
calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular, calls
that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and neither
can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a nonintegrated
call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as usual.  The
function must also be compiled as usual if the program refers to its
address, because that can't be inlined.

 Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it
unsuitable for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: variadic
functions, use of 'alloca', use of variable-length data types (*note
Variable Length::), use of computed goto (*note Labels as Values::), use
of nonlocal goto, and nested functions (*note Nested Functions::).
Using '-Winline' warns when a function marked 'inline' could not be
substituted, and gives the reason for the failure.

 As required by ISO C++, GCC considers member functions defined within
the body of a class to be marked inline even if they are not explicitly
declared with the 'inline' keyword.  You can override this with
'-fno-default-inline'; *note Options Controlling C++ Dialect: C++
Dialect Options.

 GCC does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you
specify the 'always_inline' attribute for the function, like this:

     /* Prototype.  */
     inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));

 The remainder of this section is specific to GNU C90 inlining.

 When an inline function is not 'static', then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol
can be defined only once in any program, the function must not be
defined in the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be
integrated.  Therefore, a non-'static' inline function is always
compiled on its own in the usual fashion.

 If you specify both 'inline' and 'extern' in the function definition,
then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case is the
function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its address
explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as if you
had only declared the function, and had not defined it.

 This combination of 'inline' and 'extern' has almost the effect of a
macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in a header
file with these keywords, and put another copy of the definition
(lacking 'inline' and 'extern') in a library file.  The definition in
the header file causes most calls to the function to be inlined.  If any
uses of the function remain, they refer to the single copy in the
library.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Volatiles,  Next: Extended Asm,  Prev: Inline,  Up: C Extensions

6.40 When is a Volatile Object Accessed?
========================================

C has the concept of volatile objects.  These are normally accessed by
pointers and used for accessing hardware or inter-thread communication.
The standard encourages compilers to refrain from optimizations
concerning accesses to volatile objects, but leaves it implementation
defined as to what constitutes a volatile access.  The minimum
requirement is that at a sequence point all previous accesses to
volatile objects have stabilized and no subsequent accesses have
occurred.  Thus an implementation is free to reorder and combine
volatile accesses that occur between sequence points, but cannot do so
for accesses across a sequence point.  The use of volatile does not
allow you to violate the restriction on updating objects multiple times
between two sequence points.

 Accesses to non-volatile objects are not ordered with respect to
volatile accesses.  You cannot use a volatile object as a memory barrier
to order a sequence of writes to non-volatile memory.  For instance:

     int *ptr = SOMETHING;
     volatile int vobj;
     *ptr = SOMETHING;
     vobj = 1;

Unless *PTR and VOBJ can be aliased, it is not guaranteed that the write
to *PTR occurs by the time the update of VOBJ happens.  If you need this
guarantee, you must use a stronger memory barrier such as:

     int *ptr = SOMETHING;
     volatile int vobj;
     *ptr = SOMETHING;
     asm volatile ("" : : : "memory");
     vobj = 1;

 A scalar volatile object is read when it is accessed in a void context:

     volatile int *src = SOMEVALUE;
     *src;

 Such expressions are rvalues, and GCC implements this as a read of the
volatile object being pointed to.

 Assignments are also expressions and have an rvalue.  However when
assigning to a scalar volatile, the volatile object is not reread,
regardless of whether the assignment expression's rvalue is used or not.
If the assignment's rvalue is used, the value is that assigned to the
volatile object.  For instance, there is no read of VOBJ in all the
following cases:

     int obj;
     volatile int vobj;
     vobj = SOMETHING;
     obj = vobj = SOMETHING;
     obj ? vobj = ONETHING : vobj = ANOTHERTHING;
     obj = (SOMETHING, vobj = ANOTHERTHING);

 If you need to read the volatile object after an assignment has
occurred, you must use a separate expression with an intervening
sequence point.

 As bit-fields are not individually addressable, volatile bit-fields may
be implicitly read when written to, or when adjacent bit-fields are
accessed.  Bit-field operations may be optimized such that adjacent
bit-fields are only partially accessed, if they straddle a storage unit
boundary.  For these reasons it is unwise to use volatile bit-fields to
access hardware.

6.41 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands
======================================================

In an assembler instruction using 'asm', you can specify the operands of
the instruction using C expressions.  This means you need not guess
which registers or memory locations contain the data you want to use.

 You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
each operand.

 For example, here is how to use the 68881's 'fsinx' instruction:

     asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));

Here 'angle' is the C expression for the input operand while 'result' is
that of the output operand.  Each has '"f"' as its operand constraint,
saying that a floating-point register is required.  The '=' in '=f'
indicates that the operand is an output; all output operands'
constraints must use '='.  The constraints use the same language used in
the machine description (*note Constraints::).

 Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by
the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
template from the first output operand and another separates the last
output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate the
operands within each group.  The total number of operands is currently
limited to 30; this limitation may be lifted in some future version of
GCC.

 If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you must
place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.

 As of GCC version 3.1, it is also possible to specify input and output
operands using symbolic names which can be referenced within the
assembler code.  These names are specified inside square brackets
preceding the constraint string, and can be referenced inside the
assembler code using '%[NAME]' instead of a percentage sign followed by
the operand number.  Using named operands the above example could look
like:

     asm ("fsinx %[angle],%[output]"
          : [output] "=f" (result)
          : [angle] "f" (angle));

Note that the symbolic operand names have no relation whatsoever to
other C identifiers.  You may use any name you like, even those of
existing C symbols, but you must ensure that no two operands within the
same assembler construct use the same symbolic name.

 Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check
this.  The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot
check whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction
template and does not know what it means or even whether it is valid
assembler input.  The extended 'asm' feature is most often used for
machine instructions the compiler itself does not know exist.  If the
output expression cannot be directly addressed (for example, it is a
bit-field), your constraint must allow a register.  In that case, GCC
uses the register as the output of the 'asm', and then stores that
register into the output.

 The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC assumes that the
values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need not be
generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write operands.
Use the constraint character '+' to indicate such an operand and list it
with the output operands.

 You may, as an alternative, logically split its function into two
separate operands, one input operand and one write-only output operand.
The connection between them is expressed by constraints that say they
need to be in the same location when the instruction executes.  You can
use the same C expression for both operands, or different expressions.
For example, here we write the (fictitious) 'combine' instruction with
'bar' as its read-only source operand and 'foo' as its read-write
destination:

     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));

The constraint '"0"' for operand 1 says that it must occupy the same
location as operand 0.  A number in constraint is allowed only in an
input operand and it must refer to an output operand.

 Only a number in the constraint can guarantee that one operand is in
the same place as another.  The mere fact that 'foo' is the value of
both operands is not enough to guarantee that they are in the same place
in the generated assembler code.  The following does not work reliably:

     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));

 Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to be
in different registers; GCC knows no reason not to do so.  For example,
the compiler might find a copy of the value of 'foo' in one register and
use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in a different
register (copying it afterward to 'foo''s own address).  Of course,
since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the assembler
code, the result will not work, but GCC can't tell that.

 As of GCC version 3.1, one may write '[NAME]' instead of the operand
number for a matching constraint.  For example:

     asm ("cmoveq %1,%2,%[result]"
          : [result] "=r"(result)
          : "r" (test), "r"(new), "[result]"(old));

 Sometimes you need to make an 'asm' operand be a specific register, but
there's no matching constraint letter for that register _by itself_.  To
force the operand into that register, use a local variable for the
operand and specify the register in the variable declaration.  *Note
Explicit Reg Vars::.  Then for the 'asm' operand, use any register
constraint letter that matches the register:

     register int *p1 asm ("r0") = ...;
     register int *p2 asm ("r1") = ...;
     register int *result asm ("r0");
     asm ("sysint" : "=r" (result) : "0" (p1), "r" (p2));

 In the above example, beware that a register that is call-clobbered by
the target ABI will be overwritten by any function call in the
assignment, including library calls for arithmetic operators.  Also a
register may be clobbered when generating some operations, like variable
shift, memory copy or memory move on x86.  Assuming it is a
call-clobbered register, this may happen to 'r0' above by the assignment
to 'p2'.  If you have to use such a register, use temporary variables
for expressions between the register assignment and use:

     int t1 = ...;
     register int *p1 asm ("r0") = ...;
     register int *p2 asm ("r1") = t1;
     register int *result asm ("r0");
     asm ("sysint" : "=r" (result) : "0" (p1), "r" (p2));

 Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this,
write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of
the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic
example for the VAX:

     asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
                   : /* no outputs */
                   : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
                   : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");

 You may not write a clobber description in a way that overlaps with an
input or output operand.  For example, you may not have an operand
describing a register class with one member if you mention that register
in the clobber list.  Variables declared to live in specific registers
(*note Explicit Reg Vars::), and used as asm input or output operands
must have no part mentioned in the clobber description.  There is no way
for you to specify that an input operand is modified without also
specifying it as an output operand.  Note that if all the output
operands you specify are for this purpose (and hence unused), you then
also need to specify 'volatile' for the 'asm' construct, as described
below, to prevent GCC from deleting the 'asm' statement as unused.

 If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler code,
you probably have to list the register after the third colon to tell the
compiler the register's value is modified.  In some assemblers, the
register names begin with '%'; to produce one '%' in the assembler code,
you must write '%%' in the input.

 If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register,
add 'cc' to the list of clobbered registers.  GCC on some machines
represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register; 'cc'
serves to name this register.  On other machines, the condition code is
handled differently, and specifying 'cc' has no effect.  But it is valid
no matter what the machine.

 If your assembler instructions access memory in an unpredictable
fashion, add 'memory' to the list of clobbered registers.  This causes
GCC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the assembler
instruction and not optimize stores or loads to that memory.  You also
should add the 'volatile' keyword if the memory affected is not listed
in the inputs or outputs of the 'asm', as the 'memory' clobber does not
count as a side-effect of the 'asm'.  If you know how large the accessed
memory is, you can add it as input or output but if this is not known,
you should add 'memory'.  As an example, if you access ten bytes of a
string, you can use a memory input like:

     {"m"( ({ struct { char x[10]; } *p = (void *)ptr ; *p; }) )}.

 Note that in the following example the memory input is necessary,
otherwise GCC might optimize the store to 'x' away:
     int foo ()
     {
       int x = 42;
       int *y = &x;
       int result;
       asm ("magic stuff accessing an 'int' pointed to by '%1'"
            : "=&d" (result) : "a" (y), "m" (*y));
       return result;
     }

 You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single 'asm'
template, separated by the characters normally used in assembly code for
the system.  A combination that works in most places is a newline to
break the line, plus a tab character to move to the instruction field
(written as '\n\t').  Sometimes semicolons can be used, if the assembler
allows semicolons as a line-breaking character.  Note that some
assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment.  The input
operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered registers, and
neither do the output operands' addresses, so you can read and write the
clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here is an example of
multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the subroutine '_foo'
accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:

     asm ("movl %0,r9\n\tmovl %1,r10\n\tcall _foo"
          : /* no outputs */
          : "g" (from), "g" (to)
          : "r9", "r10");

 Unless an output operand has the '&' constraint modifier, GCC may
allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on the
assumption the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced.
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use '&' for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.  *Note Modifiers::.

 If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the 'asm'
construct, as follows:

     asm ("clr %0\n\tfrob %1\n\tbeq 0f\n\tmov #1,%0\n0:"
          : "g" (result)
          : "g" (input));

This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.

 Speaking of labels, jumps from one 'asm' to another are not supported.
The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps, and therefore
they cannot take account of them when deciding how to optimize.  *Note
Extended asm with goto::.

 Usually the most convenient way to use these 'asm' instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,

     #define sin(x)       \
     ({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
        asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
        __value; })

Here the variable '__arg' is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper 'double' value, and to accept only those arguments
'x' that can convert automatically to a 'double'.

 Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data
type is to use a cast in the 'asm'.  This is different from using a
variable '__arg' in that it converts more different types.  For example,
if the desired type is 'int', casting the argument to 'int' accepts a
pointer with no complaint, while assigning the argument to an 'int'
variable named '__arg' warns about using a pointer unless the caller
explicitly casts it.

 If an 'asm' has output operands, GCC assumes for optimization purposes
the instruction has no side effects except to change the output
operands.  This does not mean instructions with a side effect cannot be
used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate them
if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also,
if your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later
if it happens to be found in a register.

 You can prevent an 'asm' instruction from being deleted by writing the
keyword 'volatile' after the 'asm'.  For example:

     #define get_and_set_priority(new)              \
     ({ int __old;                                  \
        asm volatile ("get_and_set_priority %0, %1" \
                      : "=g" (__old) : "g" (new));  \
        __old; })

The 'volatile' keyword indicates that the instruction has important
side-effects.  GCC does not delete a volatile 'asm' if it is reachable.
(The instruction can still be deleted if GCC can prove that control flow
never reaches the location of the instruction.)  Note that even a
volatile 'asm' instruction can be moved relative to other code,
including across jump instructions.  For example, on many targets there
is a system register that can be set to control the rounding mode of
floating-point operations.  You might try setting it with a volatile
'asm', like this PowerPC example:

            asm volatile("mtfsf 255,%0" : : "f" (fpenv));
            sum = x + y;

This does not work reliably, as the compiler may move the addition back
before the volatile 'asm'.  To make it work you need to add an
artificial dependency to the 'asm' referencing a variable in the code
you don't want moved, for example:

         asm volatile ("mtfsf 255,%1" : "=X"(sum): "f"(fpenv));
         sum = x + y;

 Similarly, you can't expect a sequence of volatile 'asm' instructions
to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive output, use a
single 'asm'.  Also, GCC performs some optimizations across a volatile
'asm' instruction; GCC does not "forget everything" when it encounters a
volatile 'asm' instruction the way some other compilers do.

 An 'asm' instruction without any output operands is treated identically
to a volatile 'asm' instruction.

 It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the condition
code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we attempted to
implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.  The problem
is that output operands might need reloading, which result in additional
following "store" instructions.  On most machines, these instructions
alter the condition code before there is time to test it.  This problem
doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and "compare" instructions because
they don't have any output operands.

 For reasons similar to those described above, it is not possible to
give an assembler instruction access to the condition code left by
previous instructions.

 As of GCC version 4.5, 'asm goto' may be used to have the assembly jump
to one or more C labels.  In this form, a fifth section after the
clobber list contains a list of all C labels to which the assembly may
jump.  Each label operand is implicitly self-named.  The 'asm' is also
assumed to fall through to the next statement.

 This form of 'asm' is restricted to not have outputs.  This is due to a
internal restriction in the compiler that control transfer instructions
cannot have outputs.  This restriction on 'asm goto' may be lifted in
some future version of the compiler.  In the meantime, 'asm goto' may
include a memory clobber, and so leave outputs in memory.

     int frob(int x)
     {
       int y;
       asm goto ("frob %%r5, %1; jc %l[error]; mov (%2), %%r5"
                 : : "r"(x), "r"(&y) : "r5", "memory" : error);
       return y;
      error:
       return -1;
     }

In this (inefficient) example, the 'frob' instruction sets the carry bit
to indicate an error.  The 'jc' instruction detects this and branches to
the 'error' label.  Finally, the output of the 'frob' instruction
('%r5') is stored into the memory for variable 'y', which is later read
by the 'return' statement.

     void doit(void)
     {
       int i = 0;
       asm goto ("mfsr %%r1, 123; jmp %%r1;"
                 ".pushsection doit_table;"
                 ".long %l0, %l1, %l2, %l3;"
                 ".popsection"
                 : : : "r1" : label1, label2, label3, label4);
       __builtin_unreachable ();

      label1:
       f1();
       return;
      label2:
       f2();
       return;
      label3:
       i = 1;
      label4:
       f3(i);
     }

In this (also inefficient) example, the 'mfsr' instruction reads an
address from some out-of-band machine register, and the following 'jmp'
instruction branches to that address.  The address read by the 'mfsr'
instruction is assumed to have been previously set via some
application-specific mechanism to be one of the four values stored in
the 'doit_table' section.  Finally, the 'asm' is followed by a call to
'__builtin_unreachable' to indicate that the 'asm' does not in fact fall
through.

     #define TRACE1(NUM)                         \
       do {                                      \
         asm goto ("0: nop;"                     \
                   ".pushsection trace_table;"   \
                   ".long 0b, %l0;"              \
                   ".popsection"                 \
                   : : : : trace#NUM);           \
         if (0) { trace#NUM: trace(); }          \
       } while (0)
     #define TRACE  TRACE1(__COUNTER__)

In this example (which in fact inspired the 'asm goto' feature) we want
on rare occasions to call the 'trace' function; on other occasions we'd
like to keep the overhead to the absolute minimum.  The normal code path
consists of a single 'nop' instruction.  However, we record the address
of this 'nop' together with the address of a label that calls the
'trace' function.  This allows the 'nop' instruction to be patched at
run time to be an unconditional branch to the stored label.  It is
assumed that an optimizing compiler moves the labeled block out of line,
to optimize the fall through path from the 'asm'.

 If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ISO C
programs, write '__asm__' instead of 'asm'.  *Note Alternate Keywords::.

6.41.1 Size of an 'asm'
-----------------------

Some targets require that GCC track the size of each instruction used in
order to generate correct code.  Because the final length of an 'asm' is
only known by the assembler, GCC must make an estimate as to how big it
will be.  The estimate is formed by counting the number of statements in
the pattern of the 'asm' and multiplying that by the length of the
longest instruction on that processor.  Statements in the 'asm' are
identified by newline characters and whatever statement separator
characters are supported by the assembler; on most processors this is
the ';' character.

 Normally, GCC's estimate is perfectly adequate to ensure that correct
code is generated, but it is possible to confuse the compiler if you use
pseudo instructions or assembler macros that expand into multiple real
instructions or if you use assembler directives that expand to more
space in the object file than is needed for a single instruction.  If
this happens then the assembler produces a diagnostic saying that a
label is unreachable.

6.41.2 i386 floating-point asm operands
---------------------------------------

On i386 targets, there are several rules on the usage of stack-like
registers in the operands of an 'asm'.  These rules apply only to the
operands that are stack-like registers:

  1. Given a set of input registers that die in an 'asm', it is
     necessary to know which are implicitly popped by the 'asm', and
     which must be explicitly popped by GCC.

     An input register that is implicitly popped by the 'asm' must be
     explicitly clobbered, unless it is constrained to match an output
     operand.

  2. For any input register that is implicitly popped by an 'asm', it is
     necessary to know how to adjust the stack to compensate for the
     pop.  If any non-popped input is closer to the top of the reg-stack
     than the implicitly popped register, it would not be possible to
     know what the stack looked like--it's not clear how the rest of the
     stack "slides up".

     All implicitly popped input registers must be closer to the top of
     the reg-stack than any input that is not implicitly popped.

     It is possible that if an input dies in an 'asm', the compiler
     might use the input register for an output reload.  Consider this
     example:

          asm ("foo" : "=t" (a) : "f" (b));

     This code says that input 'b' is not popped by the 'asm', and that
     the 'asm' pushes a result onto the reg-stack, i.e., the stack is
     one deeper after the 'asm' than it was before.  But, it is possible
     that reload may think that it can use the same register for both
     the input and the output.

     To prevent this from happening, if any input operand uses the 'f'
     constraint, all output register constraints must use the '&'
     early-clobber modifier.

     The example above would be correctly written as:

          asm ("foo" : "=&t" (a) : "f" (b));

  3. Some operands need to be in particular places on the stack.  All
     output operands fall in this category--GCC has no other way to know
     which registers the outputs appear in unless you indicate this in
     the constraints.

     Output operands must specifically indicate which register an output
     appears in after an 'asm'.  '=f' is not allowed: the operand
     constraints must select a class with a single register.

  4. Output operands may not be "inserted" between existing stack
     registers.  Since no 387 opcode uses a read/write operand, all
     output operands are dead before the 'asm', and are pushed by the
     'asm'.  It makes no sense to push anywhere but the top of the
     reg-stack.

     Output operands must start at the top of the reg-stack: output
     operands may not "skip" a register.

  5. Some 'asm' statements may need extra stack space for internal
     calculations.  This can be guaranteed by clobbering stack registers
     unrelated to the inputs and outputs.

 Here are a couple of reasonable 'asm's to want to write.  This 'asm'
takes one input, which is internally popped, and produces two outputs.

     asm ("fsincos" : "=t" (cos), "=u" (sin) : "0" (inp));

This 'asm' takes two inputs, which are popped by the 'fyl2xp1' opcode,
and replaces them with one output.  The 'st(1)' clobber is necessary for
the compiler to know that 'fyl2xp1' pops both inputs.

     asm ("fyl2xp1" : "=t" (result) : "0" (x), "u" (y) : "st(1)");

6.42 Constraints for 'asm' Operands
===================================

Here are specific details on what constraint letters you can use with
'asm' operands.  Constraints can say whether an operand may be in a
register, and which kinds of register; whether the operand can be a
memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether the operand may be
an immediate constant, and which possible values it may have.
Constraints can also require two operands to match.  Side-effects aren't
allowed in operands of inline 'asm', unless '<' or '>' constraints are
used, because there is no guarantee that the side-effects will happen
exactly once in an instruction that can update the addressing register.

* Menu:

* Simple Constraints::  Basic use of constraints.
* Multi-Alternative::   When an insn has two alternative constraint-patterns.
* Modifiers::           More precise control over effects of constraints.
* Machine Constraints:: Special constraints for some particular machines.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Simple Constraints,  Next: Multi-Alternative,  Up: Constraints

6.42.1 Simple Constraints
-------------------------

The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are the
letters that are allowed:

whitespace
     Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any
     position except the first.  This enables each alternative for
     different operands to be visually aligned in the machine
     description even if they have different number of constraints and
     modifiers.

'm'
     A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the
     machine supports in general.  Note that the letter used for the
     general memory constraint can be re-defined by a back end using the
     'TARGET_MEM_CONSTRAINT' macro.

'o'
     A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
     "offsettable".  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
     the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine
     mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid
     memory address.

     For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
     address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
     slightly larger constant is also within the range of
     address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or
     autodecrement address is not offsettable.  More complicated
     indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending
     on the other addressing modes that the machine supports.

     Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
     operand, the constraint letter 'o' is valid only when accompanied
     by both '<' (if the target machine has predecrement addressing) and
     '>' (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

'V'
     A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything
     that would fit the 'm' constraint but not the 'o' constraint.

'<'
     A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement
     or postdecrement) is allowed.  In inline 'asm' this constraint is
     only allowed if the operand is used exactly once in an instruction
     that can handle the side-effects.  Not using an operand with '<' in
     constraint string in the inline 'asm' pattern at all or using it in
     multiple instructions isn't valid, because the side-effects
     wouldn't be performed or would be performed more than once.
     Furthermore, on some targets the operand with '<' in constraint
     string must be accompanied by special instruction suffixes like
     '%U0' instruction suffix on PowerPC or '%P0' on IA-64.

'>'
     A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either preincrement
     or postincrement) is allowed.  In inline 'asm' the same
     restrictions as for '<' apply.

'r'
     A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
     register.

'i'
     An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
     This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
     assembly time or later.

'n'
     An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
     Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands
     less than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use
     'n' rather than 'i'.

'I', 'J', 'K', ... 'P'
     Other letters in the range 'I' through 'P' may be defined in a
     machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
     explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
     68000, 'I' is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
     This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
     instructions.

'E'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code 'const_double') is
     allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same
     as that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).

'F'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code 'const_double' or
     'const_vector') is allowed.

'G', 'H'
     'G' and 'H' may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to permit
     immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.

's'
     An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer
     is allowed.

     This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand
     with a value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any
     known value.  So why use 's' instead of 'i'?  Sometimes it allows
     better code to be generated.

     For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible
     to use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between
     -128 and 127, better code results from loading the value into a
     register and using the register.  This is because the load into the
     register can be done with a 'moveq' instruction.  We arrange for
     this to happen by defining the letter 'K' to mean "any integer
     outside the range -128 to 127", and then specifying 'Ks' in the
     operand constraints.

'g'
     Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed,
     except for registers that are not general registers.

'X'
     Any operand whatsoever is allowed.

'0', '1', '2', ... '9'
     An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.
     If a digit is used together with letters within the same
     alternative, the digit should come last.

     This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
     digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a
     single decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity, since
     to-date it has never been desirable that '10' be interpreted as
     matching either operand 1 _or_ operand 0.  Should this be desired,
     one can use multiple alternatives instead.

     This is called a "matching constraint" and what it really means is
     that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
     which 'asm' distinguishes.  For example, an add instruction uses
     two input operands and an output operand, but on most CISC machines
     an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
     input-output operand:

          addl #35,r12

     Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.  More
     precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
     operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
     smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
     constraint.

'p'
     An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is for
     "load address" and "push address" instructions.

     'p' in the constraint must be accompanied by 'address_operand' as
     the predicate in the 'match_operand'.  This predicate interprets
     the mode specified in the 'match_operand' as the mode of the memory
     reference for which the address would be valid.

OTHER-LETTERS
     Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand
     for particular classes of registers or other arbitrary operand
     types.  'd', 'a' and 'f' are defined on the 68000/68020 to stand
     for data, address and floating point registers.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Multi-Alternative,  Next: Modifiers,  Prev: Simple Constraints,  Up: Constraints

6.42.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints
---------------------------------------

Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can
combine register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine
any kind of operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory
location into another.

 These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An
alternative can be described by a series of letters for each operand.
The overall constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this
operand from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this
operand from the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last
alternative.

 If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid.
Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many
instructions must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative
applies.  The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two
alternatives need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first
is chosen.  These choices can be altered with the '?' and '!'
characters:

'?'
     Disparage slightly the alternative that the '?' appears in, as a
     choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
     this alternative as one unit more costly for each '?' that appears
     in it.

'!'
     Disparage severely the alternative that the '!' appears in.  This
     alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading, but if
     reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Next: Machine Constraints,  Prev: Multi-Alternative,  Up: Constraints

6.42.3 Constraint Modifier Characters
-------------------------------------

Here are constraint modifier characters.

'='
     Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the
     previous value is discarded and replaced by output data.

'+'
     Means that this operand is both read and written by the
     instruction.

     When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
     it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
     which are outputs from it.  '=' identifies an output; '+'
     identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other
     operands are assumed to be input only.

     If you specify '=' or '+' in a constraint, you put it in the first
     character of the constraint string.

'&'
     Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
     "earlyclobber" operand, which is modified before the instruction is
     finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not
     lie in a register that is used as an input operand or as part of
     any memory address.

     '&' applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
     constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
     requires '&' while others do not.  See, for example, the 'movdf'
     insn of the 68000.

     An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
     use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
     alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
     when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber.
     See, for example, the 'mulsi3' insn of the ARM.

     '&' does not obviate the need to write '='.

'%'
     Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
     following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange
     the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands
     fit the constraints.  GCC can only handle one commutative pair in
     an asm; if you use more, the compiler may fail.  Note that you need
     not use the modifier if the two alternatives are strictly
     identical; this would only waste time in the reload pass.  The
     modifier is not operational after register allocation, so the
     result of 'define_peephole2' and 'define_split's performed after
     reload cannot rely on '%' to make the intended insn match.

'#'
     Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
     ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
     register preferences.

'*'
     Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
     register preferences.  '*' has no effect on the meaning of the
     constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.  For LRA
     '*' additionally disparages slightly the alternative if the
     following character matches the operand.

6.42.4 Constraints for Particular Machines
------------------------------------------

Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in 'asm' arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters that
usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are 'm' and 'r' (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; *note Simple Constraints::), and
'I', usually the letter indicating the most common immediate-constant
format.

 Each architecture defines additional constraints.  These constraints
are used by the compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as
for 'asm' statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not
particularly useful for 'asm'.  Here is a summary of some of the
machine-dependent constraints available on some particular machines; it
includes both constraints that are useful for 'asm' and constraints that
aren't.  The compiler source file mentioned in the table heading for
each architecture is the definitive reference for the meanings of that
architecture's constraints.

          Integer/Floating point constant that can be loaded into a
          register using three instructions

     'm'
          Memory operand.  Normally, 'm' does not allow addresses that
          update the base register.  If '<' or '>' constraint is also
          used, they are allowed and therefore on PowerPC targets in
          that case it is only safe to use 'm<>' in an 'asm' statement
          if that 'asm' statement accesses the operand exactly once.
          The 'asm' statement must also use '%U<OPNO>' as a placeholder
          for the "update" flag in the corresponding load or store
          instruction.  For example:

               asm ("st%U0 %1,%0" : "=m<>" (mem) : "r" (val));

          is correct but:

               asm ("st %1,%0" : "=m<>" (mem) : "r" (val));

          is not.

     'es'
          A "stable" memory operand; that is, one which does not include
          any automodification of the base register.  This used to be
          useful when 'm' allowed automodification of the base register,
          but as those are now only allowed when '<' or '>' is used,
          'es' is basically the same as 'm' without '<' and '>'.

     'Q'
          Memory operand that is an offset from a register (it is
          usually better to use 'm' or 'es' in 'asm' statements)

     'Z'
          Memory operand that is an indexed or indirect from a register
          (it is usually better to use 'm' or 'es' in 'asm' statements)

     'R'
          AIX TOC entry

     'a'
          Address operand that is an indexed or indirect from a register
          ('p' is preferable for 'asm' statements)

          Legacy register--the eight integer registers available on all

     'q'
          Any register accessible as 'Rl'.  In 32-bit mode, 'a', 'b',

     'A'
          The 'a' and 'd' registers.  This class is used for
          instructions that return double word results in the 'ax:dx'
          register pair.  Single word values will be allocated either in
          'ax' or 'dx'.  For example on i386 the following implements
          'rdtsc':

               unsigned long long rdtsc (void)
               {
                 unsigned long long tick;

                 return tick;
               }

          This is not correct on x86_64 as it would allocate tick in
          either 'ax' or 'dx'.  You have to use the following variant
          instead:

               unsigned long long rdtsc (void)
               {
                 unsigned int tickl, tickh;

6.43 Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code
=============================================

You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the 'asm' (or '__asm__') keyword after
the declarator as follows:

     int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;

This specifies that the name to be used for the variable 'foo' in the
assembler code should be 'myfoo' rather than the usual '_foo'.

 On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.

 It does not make sense to use this feature with a non-static local
variable since such variables do not have assembler names.  If you are
trying to put the variable in a particular register, see *note Explicit
Reg Vars::.  GCC presently accepts such code with a warning, but will
probably be changed to issue an error, rather than a warning, in the
future.

 You cannot use 'asm' in this way in a function _definition_; but you
can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function before
its definition and putting 'asm' there, like this:

     extern func () asm ("FUNC");

     func (x, y)
          int x, y;
     /* ... */

 It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.
GCC does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in
registers.  Perhaps that will be added.

6.44 Variables in Specified Registers
=====================================

GNU C allows you to put a few global variables into specified hardware
registers.  You can also specify the register in which an ordinary
register variable should be allocated.

   * Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program.
     This may be useful in programs such as programming language
     interpreters that have a couple of global variables that are
     accessed very often.

   * Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
     registers, except at the point where they are used as input or
     output operands in an 'asm' statement and the 'asm' statement
     itself is not deleted.  The compiler's data flow analysis is
     capable of determining where the specified registers contain live
     values, and where they are available for other uses.  Stores into
     local register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
     according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register
     variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.

     These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the
     extended 'asm' feature (*note Extended Asm::), if you want to write
     one output of the assembler instruction directly into a particular
     register.  (This works provided the register you specify fits the
     constraints specified for that operand in the 'asm'.)

* Global Reg Vars::

6.44.1 Defining Global Register Variables
-----------------------------------------

You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:

     register int *foo asm ("a5");

Here 'a5' is the name of the register that should be used.  Choose a
register that is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.

 Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you need to
conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register 'a5' is
a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer type.  On machines
with register windows, be sure to choose a "global" register that is not
affected magically by the function call mechanism.

 In addition, different operating systems on the same CPU may differ in
how they name the registers; then you need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register '%a5'.

 Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a
register automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should
choose and how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is
evident.

 Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves that
register entirely for this use, at least within the current compilation.
The register is not allocated for any other purpose in the functions in
the current compilation, and is not saved and restored by these
functions.  Stores into this register are never deleted even if they
appear to be dead, but references may be deleted or moved or simplified.

 It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
library routines may temporarily use the register for other things
(unless you recompile them specially for the task at hand).

 It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable to
call another such function 'foo' by way of a third function 'lose' that
is compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a different
source file in which the variable isn't declared).  This is because
'lose' might save the register and put some other value there.  For
example, you can't expect a global register variable to be available in
the comparison-function that you pass to 'qsort', since 'qsort' might
have put something else in that register.  (If you are prepared to
recompile 'qsort' with the same global register variable, you can solve
this problem.)

 If you want to recompile 'qsort' or other source files that do not
actually use your global register variable, so that they do not use that
register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the compiler
option '-ffixed-REG'.  You need not actually add a global register
declaration to their source code.

 A function that can alter the value of a global register variable
cannot safely be called from a function compiled without this variable,
because it could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on
return.  Therefore, the function that is the entry point into the part
of the program that uses the global register variable must explicitly
save and restore the value that belongs to its caller.

 On most machines, 'longjmp' restores to each global register variable
the value it had at the time of the 'setjmp'.  On some machines,
however, 'longjmp' does not change the value of global register
variables.  To be portable, the function that called 'setjmp' should
make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a 'longjmp'.  This way, the same thing
happens regardless of what 'longjmp' does.

 All global register variable declarations must precede all function
definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register
from being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.

 Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.

 On the SPARC, there are reports that g3 ... g7 are suitable registers,
but certain library functions, such as 'getwd', as well as the
subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and g2 are
local temporaries.

 On the 68000, a2 ... a5 should be suitable, as should d2 ... d7.  Of
course, it does not do to use more than a few of those.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Local Reg Vars,  Prev: Global Reg Vars,  Up: Explicit Reg Vars

6.44.2 Specifying Registers for Local Variables
-----------------------------------------------

You can define a local register variable with a specified register like
this:

     register int *foo asm ("a5");

Here 'a5' is the name of the register that should be used.  Note that
this is the same syntax used for defining global register variables, but
for a local variable it appears within a function.

 Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (*note Extended Asm::).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to cpu
type.

 In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how
they name the registers; then you need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register '%a5'.

 Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.

 This option does not guarantee that GCC generates code that has this
variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not code an
explicit reference to this register in the _assembler instruction
template_ part of an 'asm' statement and assume it always refers to this
variable.  However, using the variable as an 'asm' _operand_ guarantees
that the specified register is used for the operand.

 Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear to
be dead according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register
variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.

 As for global register variables, it's recommended that you choose a
register that is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.  A common pitfall
is to initialize multiple call-clobbered registers with arbitrary
expressions, where a function call or library call for an arithmetic
operator overwrites a register value from a previous assignment, for
example 'r0' below:
     register int *p1 asm ("r0") = ...;
     register int *p2 asm ("r1") = ...;

In those cases, a solution is to use a temporary variable for each
arbitrary expression.  *Note Example of asm with clobbered asm reg::.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Alternate Keywords,  Next: Incomplete Enums,  Prev: Explicit Reg Vars,  Up: C Extensions

6.45 Alternate Keywords
=======================

'-ansi' and the various '-std' options disable certain keywords.  This
causes trouble when you want to use GNU C extensions, or a
general-purpose header file that should be usable by all programs,
including ISO C programs.  The keywords 'asm', 'typeof' and 'inline' are
not available in programs compiled with '-ansi' or '-std' (although
'inline' can be used in a program compiled with '-std=c99' or
'-std=c11').  The ISO C99 keyword 'restrict' is only available when
'-std=gnu99' (which will eventually be the default) or '-std=c99' (or
the equivalent '-std=iso9899:1999'), or an option for a later standard
version, is used.

 The way to solve these problems is to put '__' at the beginning and end
of each problematical keyword.  For example, use '__asm__' instead of
'asm', and '__inline__' instead of 'inline'.

 Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you want
to compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate keywords
as macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It looks like
this:

     #ifndef __GNUC__
     #define __asm__ asm
     #endif

 '-pedantic' and other options cause warnings for many GNU C extensions.
You can prevent such warnings within one expression by writing
'__extension__' before the expression.  '__extension__' has no effect
aside from this.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Incomplete Enums,  Next: Function Names,  Prev: Alternate Keywords,  Up: C Extensions

6.46 Incomplete 'enum' Types
============================

You can define an 'enum' tag without specifying its possible values.
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
'struct foo' without describing the elements.  A later declaration that
does specify the possible values completes the type.

 You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

 This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
'enum' more consistent with the way 'struct' and 'union' are handled.

 This extension is not supported by GNU C++.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Function Names,  Next: Return Address,  Prev: Incomplete Enums,  Up: C Extensions

6.47 Function Names as Strings
==============================

GCC provides three magic variables that hold the name of the current
function, as a string.  The first of these is '__func__', which is part
of the C99 standard:

 The identifier '__func__' is implicitly declared by the translator as
if, immediately following the opening brace of each function definition,
the declaration

     static const char __func__[] = "function-name";

appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
function.  This name is the unadorned name of the function.

 '__FUNCTION__' is another name for '__func__'.  Older versions of GCC
recognize only this name.  However, it is not standardized.  For maximum
portability, we recommend you use '__func__', but provide a fallback
definition with the preprocessor:

     #if __STDC_VERSION__ < 199901L
     # if __GNUC__ >= 2
     #  define __func__ __FUNCTION__
     # else
     #  define __func__ "<unknown>"
     # endif
     #endif

 In C, '__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' is yet another name for '__func__'.
However, in C++, '__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' contains the type signature of
the function as well as its bare name.  For example, this program:

     extern "C" {
     extern int printf (char *, ...);
     }

     class a {
      public:
       void sub (int i)
         {
           printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
           printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
         }
     };

     int
     main (void)
     {
       a ax;
       ax.sub (0);
       return 0;
     }

gives this output:

     __FUNCTION__ = sub
     __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = void a::sub(int)

 These identifiers are not preprocessor macros.  In GCC 3.3 and earlier,
in C only, '__FUNCTION__' and '__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' were treated as
string literals; they could be used to initialize 'char' arrays, and
they could be concatenated with other string literals.  GCC 3.4 and
later treat them as variables, like '__func__'.  In C++, '__FUNCTION__'
and '__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' have always been variables.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Return Address,  Next: Vector Extensions,  Prev: Function Names,  Up: C Extensions

6.48 Getting the Return or Frame Address of a Function
======================================================

These functions may be used to get information about the callers of a
function.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_return_address (unsigned int
          LEVEL)
     This function returns the return address of the current function,
     or of one of its callers.  The LEVEL argument is number of frames
     to scan up the call stack.  A value of '0' yields the return
     address of the current function, a value of '1' yields the return
     address of the caller of the current function, and so forth.  When
     inlining the expected behavior is that the function returns the
     address of the function that is returned to.  To work around this
     behavior use the 'noinline' function attribute.

     The LEVEL argument must be a constant integer.

     On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return
     address of any function other than the current one; in such cases,
     or when the top of the stack has been reached, this function
     returns '0' or a random value.  In addition,
     '__builtin_frame_address' may be used to determine if the top of
     the stack has been reached.

     Additional post-processing of the returned value may be needed, see
     '__builtin_extract_return_addr'.

     This function should only be used with a nonzero argument for
     debugging purposes.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_extract_return_addr (void *ADDR)
     The address as returned by '__builtin_return_address' may have to
     be fed through this function to get the actual encoded address.
     For example, on the 31-bit S/390 platform the highest bit has to be
     masked out, or on SPARC platforms an offset has to be added for the
     true next instruction to be executed.

     If no fixup is needed, this function simply passes through ADDR.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_frob_return_address (void *ADDR)
     This function does the reverse of '__builtin_extract_return_addr'.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_frame_address (unsigned int
          LEVEL)
     This function is similar to '__builtin_return_address', but it
     returns the address of the function frame rather than the return
     address of the function.  Calling '__builtin_frame_address' with a
     value of '0' yields the frame address of the current function, a
     value of '1' yields the frame address of the caller of the current
     function, and so forth.

     The frame is the area on the stack that holds local variables and
     saved registers.  The frame address is normally the address of the
     first word pushed on to the stack by the function.  However, the
     exact definition depends upon the processor and the calling
     convention.  If the processor has a dedicated frame pointer
     register, and the function has a frame, then
     '__builtin_frame_address' returns the value of the frame pointer
     register.

     On some machines it may be impossible to determine the frame
     address of any function other than the current one; in such cases,
     or when the top of the stack has been reached, this function
     returns '0' if the first frame pointer is properly initialized by
     the startup code.

     This function should only be used with a nonzero argument for
     debugging purposes.

6.49 Using Vector Instructions through Built-in Functions
=========================================================

On some targets, the instruction set contains SIMD vector instructions
which operate on multiple values contained in one large register at the
same time.  For example, on the i386 the MMX, 3DNow! and SSE extensions
can be used this way.

 The first step in using these extensions is to provide the necessary
data types.  This should be done using an appropriate 'typedef':

     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

The 'int' type specifies the base type, while the attribute specifies
the vector size for the variable, measured in bytes.  For example, the
declaration above causes the compiler to set the mode for the 'v4si'
type to be 16 bytes wide and divided into 'int' sized units.  For a
32-bit 'int' this means a vector of 4 units of 4 bytes, and the
corresponding mode of 'foo' is V4SI.

 The 'vector_size' attribute is only applicable to integral and float
scalars, although arrays, pointers, and function return values are
allowed in conjunction with this construct.  Only sizes that are a power
of two are currently allowed.

 All the basic integer types can be used as base types, both as signed
and as unsigned: 'char', 'short', 'int', 'long', 'long long'.  In
addition, 'float' and 'double' can be used to build floating-point
vector types.

 Specifying a combination that is not valid for the current architecture
causes GCC to synthesize the instructions using a narrower mode.  For
example, if you specify a variable of type 'V4SI' and your architecture
does not allow for this specific SIMD type, GCC produces code that uses
4 'SIs'.

 The types defined in this manner can be used with a subset of normal C
operations.  Currently, GCC allows using the following operators on
these types: '+, -, *, /, unary minus, ^, |, &, ~, %'.

 The operations behave like C++ 'valarrays'.  Addition is defined as the
addition of the corresponding elements of the operands.  For example, in
the code below, each of the 4 elements in A is added to the
corresponding 4 elements in B and the resulting vector is stored in C.

     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

     v4si a, b, c;

     c = a + b;

 Subtraction, multiplication, division, and the logical operations
operate in a similar manner.  Likewise, the result of using the unary
minus or complement operators on a vector type is a vector whose
elements are the negative or complemented values of the corresponding
elements in the operand.

 It is possible to use shifting operators '<<', '>>' on integer-type
vectors.  The operation is defined as following: '{a0, a1, ..., an} >>
{b0, b1, ..., bn} == {a0 >> b0, a1 >> b1, ..., an >> bn}'.  Vector
operands must have the same number of elements.

 For convenience, it is allowed to use a binary vector operation where
one operand is a scalar.  In that case the compiler transforms the
scalar operand into a vector where each element is the scalar from the
operation.  The transformation happens only if the scalar could be
safely converted to the vector-element type.  Consider the following
code.

     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

     v4si a, b, c;
     long l;

     a = b + 1;    /* a = b + {1,1,1,1}; */
     a = 2 * b;    /* a = {2,2,2,2} * b; */

     a = l + a;    /* Error, cannot convert long to int. */

 Vectors can be subscripted as if the vector were an array with the same
number of elements and base type.  Out of bound accesses invoke
undefined behavior at run time.  Warnings for out of bound accesses for
vector subscription can be enabled with '-Warray-bounds'.

 Vector comparison is supported with standard comparison operators: '==,
!=, <, <=, >, >='.  Comparison operands can be vector expressions of
integer-type or real-type.  Comparison between integer-type vectors and
real-type vectors are not supported.  The result of the comparison is a
vector of the same width and number of elements as the comparison
operands with a signed integral element type.

 Vectors are compared element-wise producing 0 when comparison is false
and -1 (constant of the appropriate type where all bits are set)
otherwise.  Consider the following example.

     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

     v4si a = {1,2,3,4};
     v4si b = {3,2,1,4};
     v4si c;

     c = a >  b;     /* The result would be {0, 0,-1, 0}  */
     c = a == b;     /* The result would be {0,-1, 0,-1}  */

 In C++, the ternary operator '?:' is available.  'a?b:c', where 'b' and
'c' are vectors of the same type and 'a' is an integer vector with the
same number of elements of the same size as 'b' and 'c', computes all
three arguments and creates a vector '{a[0]?b[0]:c[0], a[1]?b[1]:c[1],
...}'.  Note that unlike in OpenCL, 'a' is thus interpreted as 'a != 0'
and not 'a < 0'.  As in the case of binary operations, this syntax is
also accepted when one of 'b' or 'c' is a scalar that is then
transformed into a vector.  If both 'b' and 'c' are scalars and the type
of 'true?b:c' has the same size as the element type of 'a', then 'b' and
'c' are converted to a vector type whose elements have this type and
with the same number of elements as 'a'.

 Vector shuffling is available using functions '__builtin_shuffle (vec,
mask)' and '__builtin_shuffle (vec0, vec1, mask)'.  Both functions
construct a permutation of elements from one or two vectors and return a
vector of the same type as the input vector(s).  The MASK is an integral
vector with the same width (W) and element count (N) as the output
vector.

 The elements of the input vectors are numbered in memory ordering of
VEC0 beginning at 0 and VEC1 beginning at N.  The elements of MASK are
considered modulo N in the single-operand case and modulo 2*N in the
two-operand case.

 Consider the following example,

     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));

     v4si a = {1,2,3,4};
     v4si b = {5,6,7,8};
     v4si mask1 = {0,1,1,3};
     v4si mask2 = {0,4,2,5};
     v4si res;

     res = __builtin_shuffle (a, mask1);       /* res is {1,2,2,4}  */
     res = __builtin_shuffle (a, b, mask2);    /* res is {1,5,3,6}  */

 Note that '__builtin_shuffle' is intentionally semantically compatible
with the OpenCL 'shuffle' and 'shuffle2' functions.

 You can declare variables and use them in function calls and returns,
as well as in assignments and some casts.  You can specify a vector type
as a return type for a function.  Vector types can also be used as
function arguments.  It is possible to cast from one vector type to
another, provided they are of the same size (in fact, you can also cast
vectors to and from other datatypes of the same size).

 You cannot operate between vectors of different lengths or different
signedness without a cast.

6.50 Offsetof
=============

GCC implements for both C and C++ a syntactic extension to implement the
'offsetof' macro.

     primary:
             "__builtin_offsetof" "(" typename "," offsetof_member_designator ")"

     offsetof_member_designator:
               identifier
             | offsetof_member_designator "." identifier
             | offsetof_member_designator "[" expr "]"

 This extension is sufficient such that

     #define offsetof(TYPE, MEMBER)  __builtin_offsetof (TYPE, MEMBER)

is a suitable definition of the 'offsetof' macro.  In C++, TYPE may be
dependent.  In either case, MEMBER may consist of a single identifier,
or a sequence of member accesses and array references.

6.51 Legacy __sync Built-in Functions for Atomic Memory Access
==============================================================

The following built-in functions are intended to be compatible with
those described in the 'Intel Itanium Processor-specific Application
Binary Interface', section 7.4.  As such, they depart from the normal
GCC practice of using the '__builtin_' prefix, and further that they are
overloaded such that they work on multiple types.

 The definition given in the Intel documentation allows only for the use
of the types 'int', 'long', 'long long' as well as their unsigned
counterparts.  GCC allows any integral scalar or pointer type that is 1,
2, 4 or 8 bytes in length.

 Not all operations are supported by all target processors.  If a
particular operation cannot be implemented on the target processor, a
warning is generated and a call an external function is generated.  The
external function carries the same name as the built-in version, with an
additional suffix '_N' where N is the size of the data type.

 In most cases, these built-in functions are considered a "full
barrier".  That is, no memory operand is moved across the operation,
either forward or backward.  Further, instructions are issued as
necessary to prevent the processor from speculating loads across the
operation and from queuing stores after the operation.

 All of the routines are described in the Intel documentation to take
"an optional list of variables protected by the memory barrier".  It's
not clear what is meant by that; it could mean that _only_ the following
variables are protected, or it could mean that these variables should in
addition be protected.  At present GCC ignores this list and protects
all variables that are globally accessible.  If in the future we make
some use of this list, an empty list will continue to mean all globally
accessible variables.

'TYPE __sync_fetch_and_add (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_fetch_and_sub (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_fetch_and_or (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_fetch_and_and (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_fetch_and_xor (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_fetch_and_nand (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
     These built-in functions perform the operation suggested by the
     name, and returns the value that had previously been in memory.
     That is,

          { tmp = *ptr; *ptr OP= value; return tmp; }
          { tmp = *ptr; *ptr = ~(tmp & value); return tmp; }   // nand

     _Note:_ GCC 4.4 and later implement '__sync_fetch_and_nand' as
     '*ptr = ~(tmp & value)' instead of '*ptr = ~tmp & value'.

'TYPE __sync_add_and_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_sub_and_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_or_and_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_and_and_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_xor_and_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_nand_and_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
     These built-in functions perform the operation suggested by the
     name, and return the new value.  That is,

          { *ptr OP= value; return *ptr; }
          { *ptr = ~(*ptr & value); return *ptr; }   // nand

     _Note:_ GCC 4.4 and later implement '__sync_nand_and_fetch' as
     '*ptr = ~(*ptr & value)' instead of '*ptr = ~*ptr & value'.

'bool __sync_bool_compare_and_swap (TYPE *ptr, TYPE oldval, TYPE newval, ...)'
'TYPE __sync_val_compare_and_swap (TYPE *ptr, TYPE oldval, TYPE newval, ...)'
     These built-in functions perform an atomic compare and swap.  That
     is, if the current value of '*PTR' is OLDVAL, then write NEWVAL
     into '*PTR'.

     The "bool" version returns true if the comparison is successful and
     NEWVAL is written.  The "val" version returns the contents of
     '*PTR' before the operation.

'__sync_synchronize (...)'
     This built-in function issues a full memory barrier.

'TYPE __sync_lock_test_and_set (TYPE *ptr, TYPE value, ...)'
     This built-in function, as described by Intel, is not a traditional
     test-and-set operation, but rather an atomic exchange operation.
     It writes VALUE into '*PTR', and returns the previous contents of
     '*PTR'.

     Many targets have only minimal support for such locks, and do not
     support a full exchange operation.  In this case, a target may
     support reduced functionality here by which the _only_ valid value
     to store is the immediate constant 1.  The exact value actually
     stored in '*PTR' is implementation defined.

     This built-in function is not a full barrier, but rather an
     "acquire barrier".  This means that references after the operation
     cannot move to (or be speculated to) before the operation, but
     previous memory stores may not be globally visible yet, and
     previous memory loads may not yet be satisfied.

'void __sync_lock_release (TYPE *ptr, ...)'
     This built-in function releases the lock acquired by
     '__sync_lock_test_and_set'.  Normally this means writing the
     constant 0 to '*PTR'.

     This built-in function is not a full barrier, but rather a "release
     barrier".  This means that all previous memory stores are globally
     visible, and all previous memory loads have been satisfied, but
     following memory reads are not prevented from being speculated to
     before the barrier.

6.52 Built-in functions for memory model aware atomic operations
================================================================

The following built-in functions approximately match the requirements
for C++11 memory model.  Many are similar to the '__sync' prefixed
built-in functions, but all also have a memory model parameter.  These
are all identified by being prefixed with '__atomic', and most are
overloaded such that they work with multiple types.

 GCC allows any integral scalar or pointer type that is 1, 2, 4, or 8
bytes in length.  16-byte integral types are also allowed if '__int128'
(*note __int128::) is supported by the architecture.

 Target architectures are encouraged to provide their own patterns for
each of these built-in functions.  If no target is provided, the
original non-memory model set of '__sync' atomic built-in functions are
utilized, along with any required synchronization fences surrounding it
in order to achieve the proper behavior.  Execution in this case is
subject to the same restrictions as those built-in functions.

 If there is no pattern or mechanism to provide a lock free instruction
sequence, a call is made to an external routine with the same parameters
to be resolved at run time.

 The four non-arithmetic functions (load, store, exchange, and
compare_exchange) all have a generic version as well.  This generic
version works on any data type.  If the data type size maps to one of
the integral sizes that may have lock free support, the generic version
utilizes the lock free built-in function.  Otherwise an external call is
left to be resolved at run time.  This external call is the same format
with the addition of a 'size_t' parameter inserted as the first
parameter indicating the size of the object being pointed to.  All
objects must be the same size.

 There are 6 different memory models that can be specified.  These map
to the same names in the C++11 standard.  Refer there or to the GCC wiki
on atomic synchronization
(http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM/AtomicSync) for more detailed
definitions.  These memory models integrate both barriers to code motion
as well as synchronization requirements with other threads.  These are
listed in approximately ascending order of strength.  It is also
possible to use target specific flags for memory model flags, like
Hardware Lock Elision.

'__ATOMIC_RELAXED'
     No barriers or synchronization.
'__ATOMIC_CONSUME'
     Data dependency only for both barrier and synchronization with
     another thread.
'__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE'
     Barrier to hoisting of code and synchronizes with release (or
     stronger) semantic stores from another thread.
'__ATOMIC_RELEASE'
     Barrier to sinking of code and synchronizes with acquire (or
     stronger) semantic loads from another thread.
'__ATOMIC_ACQ_REL'
     Full barrier in both directions and synchronizes with acquire loads
     and release stores in another thread.
'__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST'
     Full barrier in both directions and synchronizes with acquire loads
     and release stores in all threads.

 When implementing patterns for these built-in functions, the memory
model parameter can be ignored as long as the pattern implements the
most restrictive '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST' model.  Any of the other memory
models execute correctly with this memory model but they may not execute
as efficiently as they could with a more appropriate implementation of
the relaxed requirements.

 Note that the C++11 standard allows for the memory model parameter to
be determined at run time rather than at compile time.  These built-in
functions map any run-time value to '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST' rather than
invoke a runtime library call or inline a switch statement.  This is
standard compliant, safe, and the simplest approach for now.

 The memory model parameter is a signed int, but only the lower 8 bits
are reserved for the memory model.  The remainder of the signed int is
reserved for future use and should be 0.  Use of the predefined atomic
values ensures proper usage.

 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_load_n (TYPE *ptr, int memmodel)
     This built-in function implements an atomic load operation.  It
     returns the contents of '*PTR'.

     The valid memory model variants are '__ATOMIC_RELAXED',
     '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST', '__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE', and '__ATOMIC_CONSUME'.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_load (TYPE *ptr, TYPE *ret, int
          memmodel)
     This is the generic version of an atomic load.  It returns the
     contents of '*PTR' in '*RET'.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_store_n (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
     This built-in function implements an atomic store operation.  It
     writes 'VAL' into '*PTR'.

     The valid memory model variants are '__ATOMIC_RELAXED',
     '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST', and '__ATOMIC_RELEASE'.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_store (TYPE *ptr, TYPE *val, int
          memmodel)
     This is the generic version of an atomic store.  It stores the
     value of '*VAL' into '*PTR'.

 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_exchange_n (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val,
          int memmodel)
     This built-in function implements an atomic exchange operation.  It
     writes VAL into '*PTR', and returns the previous contents of
     '*PTR'.

     The valid memory model variants are '__ATOMIC_RELAXED',
     '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST', '__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE', '__ATOMIC_RELEASE', and
     '__ATOMIC_ACQ_REL'.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_exchange (TYPE *ptr, TYPE *val,
          TYPE *ret, int memmodel)
     This is the generic version of an atomic exchange.  It stores the
     contents of '*VAL' into '*PTR'.  The original value of '*PTR' is
     copied into '*RET'.

 -- Built-in Function: bool __atomic_compare_exchange_n (TYPE *ptr, TYPE
          *expected, TYPE desired, bool weak, int success_memmodel, int
          failure_memmodel)
     This built-in function implements an atomic compare and exchange
     operation.  This compares the contents of '*PTR' with the contents
     of '*EXPECTED' and if equal, writes DESIRED into '*PTR'.  If they
     are not equal, the current contents of '*PTR' is written into
     '*EXPECTED'.  WEAK is true for weak compare_exchange, and false for
     the strong variation.  Many targets only offer the strong variation
     and ignore the parameter.  When in doubt, use the strong variation.

     True is returned if DESIRED is written into '*PTR' and the
     execution is considered to conform to the memory model specified by
     SUCCESS_MEMMODEL.  There are no restrictions on what memory model
     can be used here.

     False is returned otherwise, and the execution is considered to
     conform to FAILURE_MEMMODEL.  This memory model cannot be
     '__ATOMIC_RELEASE' nor '__ATOMIC_ACQ_REL'.  It also cannot be a
     stronger model than that specified by SUCCESS_MEMMODEL.

 -- Built-in Function: bool __atomic_compare_exchange (TYPE *ptr, TYPE
          *expected, TYPE *desired, bool weak, int success_memmodel, int
          failure_memmodel)
     This built-in function implements the generic version of
     '__atomic_compare_exchange'.  The function is virtually identical
     to '__atomic_compare_exchange_n', except the desired value is also
     a pointer.

 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_add_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_sub_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int

          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_nand_fetch (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val,
          int memmodel)
     These built-in functions perform the operation suggested by the
     name, and return the result of the operation.  That is,

          { *ptr OP= val; return *ptr; }

     All memory models are valid.

 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_fetch_add (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_fetch_sub (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_fetch_and (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_fetch_xor (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_fetch_or (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val, int
          memmodel)
 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __atomic_fetch_nand (TYPE *ptr, TYPE val,
          int memmodel)
     These built-in functions perform the operation suggested by the
     name, and return the value that had previously been in '*PTR'.
     That is,

          { tmp = *ptr; *ptr OP= val; return tmp; }

     All memory models are valid.

 -- Built-in Function: bool __atomic_test_and_set (void *ptr, int
          memmodel)

     This built-in function performs an atomic test-and-set operation on
     the byte at '*PTR'.  The byte is set to some implementation defined
     nonzero "set" value and the return value is 'true' if and only if
     the previous contents were "set".  It should be only used for
     operands of type 'bool' or 'char'.  For other types only part of
     the value may be set.

     All memory models are valid.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_clear (bool *ptr, int memmodel)

     This built-in function performs an atomic clear operation on
     '*PTR'.  After the operation, '*PTR' contains 0.  It should be only
     used for operands of type 'bool' or 'char' and in conjunction with
     '__atomic_test_and_set'.  For other types it may only clear
     partially.  If the type is not 'bool' prefer using
     '__atomic_store'.

     The valid memory model variants are '__ATOMIC_RELAXED',
     '__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST', and '__ATOMIC_RELEASE'.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_thread_fence (int memmodel)

     This built-in function acts as a synchronization fence between
     threads based on the specified memory model.

     All memory orders are valid.

 -- Built-in Function: void __atomic_signal_fence (int memmodel)

     This built-in function acts as a synchronization fence between a
     thread and signal handlers based in the same thread.

     All memory orders are valid.

 -- Built-in Function: bool __atomic_always_lock_free (size_t size, void
          *ptr)

     This built-in function returns true if objects of SIZE bytes always
     generate lock free atomic instructions for the target architecture.
     SIZE must resolve to a compile-time constant and the result also
     resolves to a compile-time constant.

     PTR is an optional pointer to the object that may be used to
     determine alignment.  A value of 0 indicates typical alignment
     should be used.  The compiler may also ignore this parameter.

          if (_atomic_always_lock_free (sizeof (long long), 0))

 -- Built-in Function: bool __atomic_is_lock_free (size_t size, void
          *ptr)

     This built-in function returns true if objects of SIZE bytes always
     generate lock free atomic instructions for the target architecture.
     If it is not known to be lock free a call is made to a runtime
     routine named '__atomic_is_lock_free'.

     PTR is an optional pointer to the object that may be used to
     determine alignment.  A value of 0 indicates typical alignment
     should be used.  The compiler may also ignore this parameter.

6.53 x86 specific memory model extensions for transactional memory
==================================================================

The i386 architecture supports additional memory ordering flags to mark
lock critical sections for hardware lock elision.  These must be
specified in addition to an existing memory model to atomic intrinsics.

'__ATOMIC_HLE_ACQUIRE'
     Start lock elision on a lock variable.  Memory model must be
     '__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE' or stronger.
'__ATOMIC_HLE_RELEASE'
     End lock elision on a lock variable.  Memory model must be
     '__ATOMIC_RELEASE' or stronger.

 When a lock acquire fails it is required for good performance to abort
the transaction quickly.  This can be done with a '_mm_pause'

     #include <immintrin.h> // For _mm_pause

     int lockvar;

     /* Acquire lock with lock elision */
     while (__atomic_exchange_n(&lockvar, 1, __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE|__ATOMIC_HLE_ACQUIRE))
         _mm_pause(); /* Abort failed transaction */
     ...
     /* Free lock with lock elision */
     __atomic_store_n(&lockvar, 0, __ATOMIC_RELEASE|__ATOMIC_HLE_RELEASE);

6.54 Object Size Checking Built-in Functions
============================================

GCC implements a limited buffer overflow protection mechanism that can
prevent some buffer overflow attacks.

 -- Built-in Function: size_t __builtin_object_size (void * PTR, int
          TYPE)
     is a built-in construct that returns a constant number of bytes
     from PTR to the end of the object PTR pointer points to (if known
     at compile time).  '__builtin_object_size' never evaluates its
     arguments for side-effects.  If there are any side-effects in them,
     it returns '(size_t) -1' for TYPE 0 or 1 and '(size_t) 0' for TYPE
     2 or 3.  If there are multiple objects PTR can point to and all of
     them are known at compile time, the returned number is the maximum
     of remaining byte counts in those objects if TYPE & 2 is 0 and
     minimum if nonzero.  If it is not possible to determine which
     objects PTR points to at compile time, '__builtin_object_size'
     should return '(size_t) -1' for TYPE 0 or 1 and '(size_t) 0' for
     TYPE 2 or 3.

     TYPE is an integer constant from 0 to 3.  If the least significant
     bit is clear, objects are whole variables, if it is set, a closest
     surrounding subobject is considered the object a pointer points to.
     The second bit determines if maximum or minimum of remaining bytes
     is computed.

          struct V { char buf1[10]; int b; char buf2[10]; } var;
          char *p = &var.buf1[1], *q = &var.b;

          /* Here the object p points to is var.  */
          assert (__builtin_object_size (p, 0) == sizeof (var) - 1);
          /* The subobject p points to is var.buf1.  */
          assert (__builtin_object_size (p, 1) == sizeof (var.buf1) - 1);
          /* The object q points to is var.  */
          assert (__builtin_object_size (q, 0)
                  == (char *) (&var + 1) - (char *) &var.b);
          /* The subobject q points to is var.b.  */
          assert (__builtin_object_size (q, 1) == sizeof (var.b));

 There are built-in functions added for many common string operation
functions, e.g., for 'memcpy' '__builtin___memcpy_chk' built-in is
provided.  This built-in has an additional last argument, which is the
number of bytes remaining in object the DEST argument points to or
'(size_t) -1' if the size is not known.

 The built-in functions are optimized into the normal string functions
like 'memcpy' if the last argument is '(size_t) -1' or if it is known at
compile time that the destination object will not be overflown.  If the
compiler can determine at compile time the object will be always
overflown, it issues a warning.

 The intended use can be e.g.

     #undef memcpy
     #define bos0(dest) __builtin_object_size (dest, 0)
     #define memcpy(dest, src, n) \
       __builtin___memcpy_chk (dest, src, n, bos0 (dest))

     char *volatile p;
     char buf[10];
     /* It is unknown what object p points to, so this is optimized
        into plain memcpy - no checking is possible.  */
     memcpy (p, "abcde", n);
     /* Destination is known and length too.  It is known at compile
        time there will be no overflow.  */
     memcpy (&buf[5], "abcde", 5);
     /* Destination is known, but the length is not known at compile time.
        This will result in __memcpy_chk call that can check for overflow
        at run time.  */
     memcpy (&buf[5], "abcde", n);
     /* Destination is known and it is known at compile time there will
        be overflow.  There will be a warning and __memcpy_chk call that
        will abort the program at run time.  */
     memcpy (&buf[6], "abcde", 5);

 Such built-in functions are provided for 'memcpy', 'mempcpy',
'memmove', 'memset', 'strcpy', 'stpcpy', 'strncpy', 'strcat' and
'strncat'.

 There are also checking built-in functions for formatted output
functions.
     int __builtin___sprintf_chk (char *s, int flag, size_t os, const char *fmt, ...);
     int __builtin___snprintf_chk (char *s, size_t maxlen, int flag, size_t os,
                                   const char *fmt, ...);
     int __builtin___vsprintf_chk (char *s, int flag, size_t os, const char *fmt,
                                   va_list ap);
     int __builtin___vsnprintf_chk (char *s, size_t maxlen, int flag, size_t os,
                                    const char *fmt, va_list ap);

 The added FLAG argument is passed unchanged to '__sprintf_chk' etc.
functions and can contain implementation specific flags on what
additional security measures the checking function might take, such as
handling '%n' differently.

 The OS argument is the object size S points to, like in the other
built-in functions.  There is a small difference in the behavior though,
if OS is '(size_t) -1', the built-in functions are optimized into the
non-checking functions only if FLAG is 0, otherwise the checking
function is called with OS argument set to '(size_t) -1'.

 In addition to this, there are checking built-in functions
'__builtin___printf_chk', '__builtin___vprintf_chk',
'__builtin___fprintf_chk' and '__builtin___vfprintf_chk'.  These have
just one additional argument, FLAG, right before format string FMT.  If
the compiler is able to optimize them to 'fputc' etc. functions, it
does, otherwise the checking function is called and the FLAG argument
passed to it.

6.56 Other Built-in Functions Provided by GCC
=============================================

GCC provides a large number of built-in functions other than the ones
mentioned above.  Some of these are for internal use in the processing
of exceptions or variable-length argument lists and are not documented
here because they may change from time to time; we do not recommend
general use of these functions.

 The remaining functions are provided for optimization purposes.

 GCC includes built-in versions of many of the functions in the standard
C library.  The versions prefixed with '__builtin_' are always treated
as having the same meaning as the C library function even if you specify
the '-fno-builtin' option.  (*note C Dialect Options::) Many of these
functions are only optimized in certain cases; if they are not optimized
in a particular case, a call to the library function is emitted.

 Outside strict ISO C mode ('-ansi', '-std=c90', '-std=c99' or

 There are also built-in versions of the ISO C99 functions 'acosf',

'sqrtf', 'sqrtl', 'tanf', 'tanhf', 'tanhl' and 'tanl' that are
recognized in any mode since ISO C90 reserves these names for the
purpose to which ISO C99 puts them.  All these functions have
corresponding versions prefixed with '__builtin_'.

 The ISO C94 functions 'iswalnum', 'iswalpha', 'iswcntrl', 'iswdigit',
'iswgraph', 'iswlower', 'iswprint', 'iswpunct', 'iswspace', 'iswupper',
'iswxdigit', 'towlower' and 'towupper' are handled as built-in functions
except in strict ISO C90 mode ('-ansi' or '-std=c90').

 The ISO C90 functions 'abort', 'abs', 'acos', 'asin', 'atan2', 'atan',
'calloc', 'ceil', 'cosh', 'cos', 'exit', 'exp', 'fabs', 'floor', 'fmod',

'vsprintf' are all recognized as built-in functions unless
'-fno-builtin' is specified (or '-fno-builtin-FUNCTION' is specified for
an individual function).  All of these functions have corresponding
versions prefixed with '__builtin_'.

 GCC provides built-in versions of the ISO C99 floating-point comparison
macros that avoid raising exceptions for unordered operands.  They have
the same names as the standard macros ( 'isgreater', 'isgreaterequal',
'isless', 'islessequal', 'islessgreater', and 'isunordered') , with
'__builtin_' prefixed.  We intend for a library implementor to be able
to simply '#define' each standard macro to its built-in equivalent.  In
the same fashion, GCC provides 'fpclassify', 'isfinite', 'isinf_sign'
and 'isnormal' built-ins used with '__builtin_' prefixed.  The 'isinf'
and 'isnan' built-in functions appear both with and without the
'__builtin_' prefix.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_types_compatible_p (TYPE1, TYPE2)

     You can use the built-in function '__builtin_types_compatible_p' to
     determine whether two types are the same.

     This built-in function returns 1 if the unqualified versions of the
     types TYPE1 and TYPE2 (which are types, not expressions) are
     compatible, 0 otherwise.  The result of this built-in function can
     be used in integer constant expressions.

     This built-in function ignores top level qualifiers (e.g., 'const',
     'volatile').  For example, 'int' is equivalent to 'const int'.

     The type 'int[]' and 'int[5]' are compatible.  On the other hand,
     'int' and 'char *' are not compatible, even if the size of their
     types, on the particular architecture are the same.  Also, the
     amount of pointer indirection is taken into account when
     determining similarity.  Consequently, 'short *' is not similar to
     'short **'.  Furthermore, two types that are typedefed are
     considered compatible if their underlying types are compatible.

     An 'enum' type is not considered to be compatible with another
     'enum' type even if both are compatible with the same integer type;
     this is what the C standard specifies.  For example, 'enum {foo,
     bar}' is not similar to 'enum {hot, dog}'.

     You typically use this function in code whose execution varies
     depending on the arguments' types.  For example:

          #define foo(x)                                                  \
            ({                                                           \
              typeof (x) tmp = (x);                                       \
              if (__builtin_types_compatible_p (typeof (x), long double)) \
                tmp = foo_long_double (tmp);                              \
              else if (__builtin_types_compatible_p (typeof (x), double)) \
                tmp = foo_double (tmp);                                   \
              else if (__builtin_types_compatible_p (typeof (x), float))  \
                tmp = foo_float (tmp);                                    \
              else                                                        \
                abort ();                                                 \
              tmp;                                                        \
            })

     _Note:_ This construct is only available for C.

 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __builtin_choose_expr (CONST_EXP, EXP1,
          EXP2)

     You can use the built-in function '__builtin_choose_expr' to
     evaluate code depending on the value of a constant expression.
     This built-in function returns EXP1 if CONST_EXP, which is an
     integer constant expression, is nonzero.  Otherwise it returns
     EXP2.

     This built-in function is analogous to the '? :' operator in C,
     except that the expression returned has its type unaltered by
     promotion rules.  Also, the built-in function does not evaluate the
     expression that is not chosen.  For example, if CONST_EXP evaluates
     to true, EXP2 is not evaluated even if it has side-effects.

     This built-in function can return an lvalue if the chosen argument
     is an lvalue.

     If EXP1 is returned, the return type is the same as EXP1's type.
     Similarly, if EXP2 is returned, its return type is the same as
     EXP2.

     Example:

          #define foo(x)                                                    \
            __builtin_choose_expr (                                         \
              __builtin_types_compatible_p (typeof (x), double),            \
              foo_double (x),                                               \
              __builtin_choose_expr (                                       \
                __builtin_types_compatible_p (typeof (x), float),           \
                foo_float (x),                                              \
                /* The void expression results in a compile-time error  \
                   when assigning the result to something.  */          \
                (void)0))

     _Note:_ This construct is only available for C.  Furthermore, the
     unused expression (EXP1 or EXP2 depending on the value of
     CONST_EXP) may still generate syntax errors.  This may change in
     future revisions.

 -- Built-in Function: TYPE __builtin_complex (REAL, IMAG)

     The built-in function '__builtin_complex' is provided for use in
     implementing the ISO C11 macros 'CMPLXF', 'CMPLX' and 'CMPLXL'.
     REAL and IMAG must have the same type, a real binary floating-point
     type, and the result has the corresponding complex type with real
     and imaginary parts REAL and IMAG.  Unlike 'REAL + I * IMAG', this
     works even when infinities, NaNs and negative zeros are involved.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_constant_p (EXP)
     You can use the built-in function '__builtin_constant_p' to
     determine if a value is known to be constant at compile time and
     hence that GCC can perform constant-folding on expressions
     involving that value.  The argument of the function is the value to
     test.  The function returns the integer 1 if the argument is known
     to be a compile-time constant and 0 if it is not known to be a
     compile-time constant.  A return of 0 does not indicate that the
     value is _not_ a constant, but merely that GCC cannot prove it is a
     constant with the specified value of the '-O' option.

     You typically use this function in an embedded application where
     memory is a critical resource.  If you have some complex
     calculation, you may want it to be folded if it involves constants,
     but need to call a function if it does not.  For example:

          #define Scale_Value(X)      \
            (__builtin_constant_p (X) \
            ? ((X) * SCALE + OFFSET) : Scale (X))

     You may use this built-in function in either a macro or an inline
     function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass
     an argument of the function as the argument to the built-in, GCC
     never returns 1 when you call the inline function with a string
     constant or compound literal (*note Compound Literals::) and does
     not return 1 when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline
     function unless you specify the '-O' option.

     You may also use '__builtin_constant_p' in initializers for static
     data.  For instance, you can write

          static const int table[] = {
             __builtin_constant_p (EXPRESSION) ? (EXPRESSION) : -1,
             /* ... */
          };

     This is an acceptable initializer even if EXPRESSION is not a
     constant expression, including the case where
     '__builtin_constant_p' returns 1 because EXPRESSION can be folded
     to a constant but EXPRESSION contains operands that are not
     otherwise permitted in a static initializer (for example, '0 && foo
     ()').  GCC must be more conservative about evaluating the built-in
     in this case, because it has no opportunity to perform
     optimization.

     Previous versions of GCC did not accept this built-in in data
     initializers.  The earliest version where it is completely safe is
     3.0.1.

 -- Built-in Function: long __builtin_expect (long EXP, long C)
     You may use '__builtin_expect' to provide the compiler with branch
     prediction information.  In general, you should prefer to use
     actual profile feedback for this ('-fprofile-arcs'), as programmers
     are notoriously bad at predicting how their programs actually
     perform.  However, there are applications in which this data is
     hard to collect.

     The return value is the value of EXP, which should be an integral
     expression.  The semantics of the built-in are that it is expected
     that EXP == C.  For example:

          if (__builtin_expect (x, 0))
            foo ();

     indicates that we do not expect to call 'foo', since we expect 'x'
     to be zero.  Since you are limited to integral expressions for EXP,
     you should use constructions such as

          if (__builtin_expect (ptr != NULL, 1))
            foo (*ptr);

     when testing pointer or floating-point values.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_trap (void)
     This function causes the program to exit abnormally.  GCC
     implements this function by using a target-dependent mechanism
     (such as intentionally executing an illegal instruction) or by
     calling 'abort'.  The mechanism used may vary from release to
     release so you should not rely on any particular implementation.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_unreachable (void)
     If control flow reaches the point of the '__builtin_unreachable',
     the program is undefined.  It is useful in situations where the
     compiler cannot deduce the unreachability of the code.

     One such case is immediately following an 'asm' statement that
     either never terminates, or one that transfers control elsewhere
     and never returns.  In this example, without the
     '__builtin_unreachable', GCC issues a warning that control reaches
     the end of a non-void function.  It also generates code to return
     after the 'asm'.

          int f (int c, int v)
          {
            if (c)
              {
                return v;
              }
            else
              {
                asm("jmp error_handler");
                __builtin_unreachable ();
              }
          }

     Because the 'asm' statement unconditionally transfers control out
     of the function, control never reaches the end of the function
     body.  The '__builtin_unreachable' is in fact unreachable and
     communicates this fact to the compiler.

     Another use for '__builtin_unreachable' is following a call a
     function that never returns but that is not declared
     '__attribute__((noreturn))', as in this example:

          void function_that_never_returns (void);

          int g (int c)
          {
            if (c)
              {
                return 1;
              }
            else
              {
                function_that_never_returns ();
                __builtin_unreachable ();
              }
          }

 -- Built-in Function: void *__builtin_assume_aligned (const void *EXP,
          size_t ALIGN, ...)
     This function returns its first argument, and allows the compiler
     to assume that the returned pointer is at least ALIGN bytes
     aligned.  This built-in can have either two or three arguments, if
     it has three, the third argument should have integer type, and if
     it is nonzero means misalignment offset.  For example:

          void *x = __builtin_assume_aligned (arg, 16);

     means that the compiler can assume 'x', set to 'arg', is at least
     16-byte aligned, while:

          void *x = __builtin_assume_aligned (arg, 32, 8);

     means that the compiler can assume for 'x', set to 'arg', that
     '(char *) x - 8' is 32-byte aligned.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_LINE ()
     This function is the equivalent to the preprocessor '__LINE__'
     macro and returns the line number of the invocation of the
     built-in.  In a C++ default argument for a function F, it gets the
     line number of the call to F.

 -- Built-in Function: const char * __builtin_FUNCTION ()
     This function is the equivalent to the preprocessor '__FUNCTION__'
     macro and returns the function name the invocation of the built-in
     is in.

 -- Built-in Function: const char * __builtin_FILE ()
     This function is the equivalent to the preprocessor '__FILE__'
     macro and returns the file name the invocation of the built-in is
     in.  In a C++ default argument for a function F, it gets the file
     name of the call to F.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin___clear_cache (char *BEGIN, char
          *END)
     This function is used to flush the processor's instruction cache
     for the region of memory between BEGIN inclusive and END exclusive.
     Some targets require that the instruction cache be flushed, after
     modifying memory containing code, in order to obtain deterministic
     behavior.

     If the target does not require instruction cache flushes,
     '__builtin___clear_cache' has no effect.  Otherwise either
     instructions are emitted in-line to clear the instruction cache or
     a call to the '__clear_cache' function in libgcc is made.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_prefetch (const void *ADDR, ...)
     This function is used to minimize cache-miss latency by moving data
     into a cache before it is accessed.  You can insert calls to
     '__builtin_prefetch' into code for which you know addresses of data
     in memory that is likely to be accessed soon.  If the target
     supports them, data prefetch instructions are generated.  If the
     prefetch is done early enough before the access then the data will
     be in the cache by the time it is accessed.

     The value of ADDR is the address of the memory to prefetch.  There
     are two optional arguments, RW and LOCALITY.  The value of RW is a
     compile-time constant one or zero; one means that the prefetch is
     preparing for a write to the memory address and zero, the default,
     means that the prefetch is preparing for a read.  The value
     LOCALITY must be a compile-time constant integer between zero and
     three.  A value of zero means that the data has no temporal
     locality, so it need not be left in the cache after the access.  A
     value of three means that the data has a high degree of temporal
     locality and should be left in all levels of cache possible.
     Values of one and two mean, respectively, a low or moderate degree
     of temporal locality.  The default is three.

          for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
              a[i] = a[i] + b[i];
              __builtin_prefetch (&a[i+j], 1, 1);
              __builtin_prefetch (&b[i+j], 0, 1);
              /* ... */
            }

     Data prefetch does not generate faults if ADDR is invalid, but the
     address expression itself must be valid.  For example, a prefetch
     of 'p->next' does not fault if 'p->next' is not a valid address,
     but evaluation faults if 'p' is not a valid address.

     If the target does not support data prefetch, the address
     expression is evaluated if it includes side effects but no other
     code is generated and GCC does not issue a warning.

 -- Built-in Function: double __builtin_huge_val (void)
     Returns a positive infinity, if supported by the floating-point
     format, else 'DBL_MAX'.  This function is suitable for implementing
     the ISO C macro 'HUGE_VAL'.

 -- Built-in Function: float __builtin_huge_valf (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_huge_val', except the return type is 'float'.

 -- Built-in Function: long double __builtin_huge_vall (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_huge_val', except the return type is 'long
     double'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_fpclassify (int, int, int, int,
          int, ...)
     This built-in implements the C99 fpclassify functionality.  The
     first five int arguments should be the target library's notion of
     the possible FP classes and are used for return values.  They must
     be constant values and they must appear in this order: 'FP_NAN',
     'FP_INFINITE', 'FP_NORMAL', 'FP_SUBNORMAL' and 'FP_ZERO'.  The
     ellipsis is for exactly one floating-point value to classify.  GCC
     treats the last argument as type-generic, which means it does not
     do default promotion from float to double.

 -- Built-in Function: double __builtin_inf (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_huge_val', except a warning is generated if
     the target floating-point format does not support infinities.

 -- Built-in Function: _Decimal32 __builtin_infd32 (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is '_Decimal32'.

 -- Built-in Function: _Decimal64 __builtin_infd64 (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is '_Decimal64'.

 -- Built-in Function: _Decimal128 __builtin_infd128 (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is
     '_Decimal128'.

 -- Built-in Function: float __builtin_inff (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is 'float'.
     This function is suitable for implementing the ISO C99 macro
     'INFINITY'.

 -- Built-in Function: long double __builtin_infl (void)
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is 'long
     double'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_isinf_sign (...)
     Similar to 'isinf', except the return value is -1 for an argument
     of '-Inf' and 1 for an argument of '+Inf'.  Note while the
     parameter list is an ellipsis, this function only accepts exactly
     one floating-point argument.  GCC treats this parameter as
     type-generic, which means it does not do default promotion from
     float to double.

 -- Built-in Function: double __builtin_nan (const char *str)
     This is an implementation of the ISO C99 function 'nan'.

     Since ISO C99 defines this function in terms of 'strtod', which we
     do not implement, a description of the parsing is in order.  The
     string is parsed as by 'strtol'; that is, the base is recognized by
     leading '0' or '0x' prefixes.  The number parsed is placed in the
     significand such that the least significant bit of the number is at
     the least significant bit of the significand.  The number is
     truncated to fit the significand field provided.  The significand
     is forced to be a quiet NaN.

     This function, if given a string literal all of which would have
     been consumed by 'strtol', is evaluated early enough that it is
     considered a compile-time constant.

 -- Built-in Function: _Decimal32 __builtin_nand32 (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nan', except the return type is '_Decimal32'.

 -- Built-in Function: _Decimal64 __builtin_nand64 (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nan', except the return type is '_Decimal64'.

 -- Built-in Function: _Decimal128 __builtin_nand128 (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nan', except the return type is
     '_Decimal128'.

 -- Built-in Function: float __builtin_nanf (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nan', except the return type is 'float'.

 -- Built-in Function: long double __builtin_nanl (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nan', except the return type is 'long
     double'.

 -- Built-in Function: double __builtin_nans (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nan', except the significand is forced to be
     a signaling NaN.  The 'nans' function is proposed by WG14 N965.

 -- Built-in Function: float __builtin_nansf (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nans', except the return type is 'float'.

 -- Built-in Function: long double __builtin_nansl (const char *str)
     Similar to '__builtin_nans', except the return type is 'long
     double'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_ffs (int x)
     Returns one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit of X, or
     if X is zero, returns zero.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_clz (unsigned int x)
     Returns the number of leading 0-bits in X, starting at the most
     significant bit position.  If X is 0, the result is undefined.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_ctz (unsigned int x)
     Returns the number of trailing 0-bits in X, starting at the least
     significant bit position.  If X is 0, the result is undefined.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_clrsb (int x)
     Returns the number of leading redundant sign bits in X, i.e. the
     number of bits following the most significant bit that are
     identical to it.  There are no special cases for 0 or other values.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)
     Returns the number of 1-bits in X.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_parity (unsigned int x)
     Returns the parity of X, i.e. the number of 1-bits in X modulo 2.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_ffsl (long)
     Similar to '__builtin_ffs', except the argument type is 'long'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_clzl (unsigned long)
     Similar to '__builtin_clz', except the argument type is 'unsigned
     long'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_ctzl (unsigned long)
     Similar to '__builtin_ctz', except the argument type is 'unsigned
     long'.

     Similar to '__builtin_clrsb', except the argument type is 'long'.

     long'.

     long long'.

     Similar to '__builtin_ctz', except the argument type is 'unsigned
     long long'.

     Similar to '__builtin_clrsb', except the argument type is 'long
     long'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_popcountll (unsigned long long)
     Similar to '__builtin_popcount', except the argument type is
     'unsigned long long'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_parityll (unsigned long long)
     Similar to '__builtin_parity', except the argument type is
     'unsigned long long'.

 -- Built-in Function: double __builtin_powi (double, int)
     Returns the first argument raised to the power of the second.
     Unlike the 'pow' function no guarantees about precision and

6.57.3 ARC Built-in Functions
-----------------------------

The following built-in functions are provided for ARC targets.  The
built-ins generate the corresponding assembly instructions.  In the
examples given below, the generated code often requires an operand or
result to be in a register.  Where necessary further code will be
generated to ensure this is true, but for brevity this is not described
in each case.

 _Note:_ Using a built-in to generate an instruction not supported by a
target may cause problems.  At present the compiler is not guaranteed to
detect such misuse, and as a result an internal compiler error may be
generated.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_arc_aligned (void *VAL, int
          ALIGNVAL)
     Return 1 if VAL is known to have the byte alignment given by
     ALIGNVAL, otherwise return 0.  Note that this is different from
          __alignof__(*(char *)VAL) >= alignval
     because __alignof__ sees only the type of the dereference, whereas
     __builtin_arc_align uses alignment information from the pointer as
     well as from the pointed-to type.  The information available will
     depend on optimization level.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_arc_brk (void)
     Generates
          brk

 -- Built-in Function: unsigned int __builtin_arc_core_read (unsigned
          int REGNO)
     The operand is the number of a register to be read.  Generates:
          mov  DEST, rREGNO
     where the value in DEST will be the result returned from the
     built-in.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_arc_core_write (unsigned int
          REGNO, unsigned int VAL)
     The first operand is the number of a register to be written, the
     second operand is a compile time constant to write into that
     register.  Generates:
          mov  rREGNO, VAL

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_arc_divaw (int A, int B)
     Only available if either '-mcpu=ARC700' or '-meA' is set.
     Generates:
          divaw  DEST, A, B
     where the value in DEST will be the result returned from the
     built-in.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_arc_flag (unsigned int A)
     Generates
          flag  A

 -- Built-in Function: unsigned int __builtin_arc_lr (unsigned int AUXR)
     The operand, AUXV, is the address of an auxiliary register and must
     be a compile time constant.  Generates:
          lr  DEST, [AUXR]
     Where the value in DEST will be the result returned from the
     built-in.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_arc_mul64 (int A, int B)
     Only available with '-mmul64'.  Generates:
          mul64  A, B

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_arc_mulu64 (unsigned int A,
          unsigned int B)
     Only available with '-mmul64'.  Generates:
          mulu64  A, B

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_arc_nop (void)
     Generates:
          nop

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_arc_norm (int SRC)
     Only valid if the 'norm' instruction is available through the
     '-mnorm' option or by default with '-mcpu=ARC700'.  Generates:
          norm  DEST, SRC
     Where the value in DEST will be the result returned from the
     built-in.

 -- Built-in Function: short int __builtin_arc_normw (short int SRC)
     Only valid if the 'normw' instruction is available through the
     '-mnorm' option or by default with '-mcpu=ARC700'.  Generates:
          normw  DEST, SRC

6.57.4 ARC SIMD Built-in Functions
----------------------------------

SIMD builtins provided by the compiler can be used to generate the
vector instructions.  This section describes the available builtins and
their usage in programs.  With the '-msimd' option, the compiler
provides 128-bit vector types, which can be specified using the
'vector_size' attribute.  The header file 'arc-simd.h' can be included
to use the following predefined types:
     typedef int __v4si   __attribute__((vector_size(16)));
     typedef short __v8hi __attribute__((vector_size(16)));

 These types can be used to define 128-bit variables.  The built-in
functions listed in the following section can be used on these variables
to generate the vector operations.

 For all builtins, '__builtin_arc_SOMEINSN', the header file
'arc-simd.h' also provides equivalent macros called '_SOMEINSN' that can
be used for programming ease and improved readability.  The following
macros for DMA control are also provided:
     #define _setup_dma_in_channel_reg _vdiwr
     #define _setup_dma_out_channel_reg _vdowr

 The following is a complete list of all the SIMD built-ins provided for
ARC, grouped by calling signature.

6.57.8 AVR Built-in Functions
-----------------------------

For each built-in function for AVR, there is an equally named, uppercase
built-in macro defined.  That way users can easily query if or if not a
specific built-in is implemented or not.  For example, if
'__builtin_avr_nop' is available the macro '__BUILTIN_AVR_NOP' is
defined to '1' and undefined otherwise.

 The following built-in functions map to the respective machine
instruction, i.e. 'nop', 'sei', 'cli', 'sleep', 'wdr', 'swap', 'fmul',
'fmuls' resp.  'fmulsu'.  The three 'fmul*' built-ins are implemented as
library call if no hardware multiplier is available.

     void __builtin_avr_nop (void)
     void __builtin_avr_sei (void)
     void __builtin_avr_cli (void)
     void __builtin_avr_sleep (void)
     void __builtin_avr_wdr (void)
     unsigned char __builtin_avr_swap (unsigned char)
     unsigned int __builtin_avr_fmul (unsigned char, unsigned char)
     int __builtin_avr_fmuls (char, char)
     int __builtin_avr_fmulsu (char, unsigned char)

 In order to delay execution for a specific number of cycles, GCC
implements
     void __builtin_avr_delay_cycles (unsigned long ticks)

'ticks' is the number of ticks to delay execution.  Note that this
built-in does not take into account the effect of interrupts that might
increase delay time.  'ticks' must be a compile-time integer constant;
delays with a variable number of cycles are not supported.

     char __builtin_avr_flash_segment (const __memx void*)

This built-in takes a byte address to the 24-bit *note address space:
AVR Named Address Spaces. '__memx' and returns the number of the flash
segment (the 64 KiB chunk) where the address points to.  Counting starts
at '0'.  If the address does not point to flash memory, return '-1'.

     unsigned char __builtin_avr_insert_bits (unsigned long map, unsigned char bits, unsigned char val)

Insert bits from BITS into VAL and return the resulting value.  The
nibbles of MAP determine how the insertion is performed: Let X be the
N-th nibble of MAP
  1. If X is '0xf', then the N-th bit of VAL is returned unaltered.

  2. If X is in the range 0...7, then the N-th result bit is set to the
     X-th bit of BITS

  3. If X is in the range 8...'0xe', then the N-th result bit is
     undefined.

One typical use case for this built-in is adjusting input and output
values to non-contiguous port layouts.  Some examples:

     // same as val, bits is unused
     __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0xffffffff, bits, val)

     // same as bits, val is unused
     __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0x76543210, bits, val)

     // same as rotating bits by 4
     __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0x32107654, bits, 0)

     // high nibble of result is the high nibble of val
     // low nibble of result is the low nibble of bits
     __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0xffff3210, bits, val)

     // reverse the bit order of bits
     __builtin_avr_insert_bits (0x01234567, bits, 0)

6.57.9 Blackfin Built-in Functions
----------------------------------

Currently, there are two Blackfin-specific built-in functions.  These
are used for generating 'CSYNC' and 'SSYNC' machine insns without using
inline assembly; by using these built-in functions the compiler can
automatically add workarounds for hardware errata involving these
instructions.  These functions are named as follows:

     void __builtin_bfin_csync (void)
     void __builtin_bfin_ssync (void)

6.57.10 FR-V Built-in Functions
-------------------------------

GCC provides many FR-V-specific built-in functions.  In general, these
functions are intended to be compatible with those described by 'FR-V
Family, Softune C/C++ Compiler Manual (V6), Fujitsu Semiconductor'.  The
two exceptions are '__MDUNPACKH' and '__MBTOHE', the GCC forms of which
pass 128-bit values by pointer rather than by value.

 Most of the functions are named after specific FR-V instructions.  Such
functions are said to be "directly mapped" and are summarized here in
tabular form.

File: gcc.info,  Node: Argument Types,  Next: Directly-mapped Integer Functions,  Up: FR-V Built-in Functions

6.57.10.1 Argument Types
........................

The arguments to the built-in functions can be divided into three
groups: register numbers, compile-time constants and run-time values.
In order to make this classification clear at a glance, the arguments
and return values are given the following pseudo types:

Pseudo type    Real C type            Constant?   Description
'uh'           'unsigned short'       No          an unsigned halfword
'uw1'          'unsigned int'         No          an unsigned word
'sw1'          'int'                  No          a signed word
'uw2'          'unsigned long long'   No          an unsigned doubleword
'sw2'          'long long'            No          a signed doubleword
'const'        'int'                  Yes         an integer constant
'acc'          'int'                  Yes         an ACC register number
'iacc'         'int'                  Yes         an IACC register number

 These pseudo types are not defined by GCC, they are simply a notational
convenience used in this manual.

 Arguments of type 'uh', 'uw1', 'sw1', 'uw2' and 'sw2' are evaluated at
run time.  They correspond to register operands in the underlying FR-V
instructions.

 'const' arguments represent immediate operands in the underlying FR-V
instructions.  They must be compile-time constants.

 'acc' arguments are evaluated at compile time and specify the number of
an accumulator register.  For example, an 'acc' argument of 2 selects
the ACC2 register.

 'iacc' arguments are similar to 'acc' arguments but specify the number
of an IACC register.  See *note Other Built-in Functions:: for more
details.

6.57.11 X86 Built-in Functions
------------------------------

These built-in functions are available for the i386 and x86-64 family of
computers, depending on the command-line switches used.

 If you specify command-line switches such as '-msse', the compiler
could use the extended instruction sets even if the built-ins are not
used explicitly in the program.  For this reason, applications that
perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each
supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular, the
file containing the CPU detection code should be compiled without these
options.

 The following machine modes are available for use with MMX built-in
functions (*note Vector Extensions::): 'V2SI' for a vector of two 32-bit
integers, 'V4HI' for a vector of four 16-bit integers, and 'V8QI' for a
vector of eight 8-bit integers.  Some of the built-in functions operate
on MMX registers as a whole 64-bit entity, these use 'V1DI' as their
mode.

 If 3DNow! extensions are enabled, 'V2SF' is used as a mode for a vector
of two 32-bit floating-point values.

 If SSE extensions are enabled, 'V4SF' is used for a vector of four
32-bit floating-point values.  Some instructions use a vector of four
32-bit integers, these use 'V4SI'.  Finally, some instructions operate
on an entire vector register, interpreting it as a 128-bit integer,
these use mode 'TI'.

 In 64-bit mode, the x86-64 family of processors uses additional
built-in functions for efficient use of 'TF' ('__float128') 128-bit
floating point and 'TC' 128-bit complex floating-point values.

 The following floating-point built-in functions are available in 64-bit
mode.  All of them implement the function that is part of the name.

     __float128 __builtin_fabsq (__float128)
     __float128 __builtin_copysignq (__float128, __float128)

 The following built-in function is always available.

'void __builtin_ia32_pause (void)'
     Generates the 'pause' machine instruction with a compiler memory
     barrier.

 The following floating-point built-in functions are made available in
the 64-bit mode.

'__float128 __builtin_infq (void)'
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is '__float128'.

'__float128 __builtin_huge_valq (void)'
     Similar to '__builtin_huge_val', except the return type is
     '__float128'.

 The following built-in functions are always available and can be used
to check the target platform type.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_cpu_init (void)
     This function runs the CPU detection code to check the type of CPU
     and the features supported.  This built-in function needs to be
     invoked along with the built-in functions to check CPU type and
     features, '__builtin_cpu_is' and '__builtin_cpu_supports', only
     when used in a function that is executed before any constructors
     are called.  The CPU detection code is automatically executed in a
     very high priority constructor.

     For example, this function has to be used in 'ifunc' resolvers that
     check for CPU type using the built-in functions '__builtin_cpu_is'
     and '__builtin_cpu_supports', or in constructors on targets that
     don't support constructor priority.

          static void (*resolve_memcpy (void)) (void)
          {
            // ifunc resolvers fire before constructors, explicitly call the init
            // function.
            __builtin_cpu_init ();
            if (__builtin_cpu_supports ("ssse3"))
              return ssse3_memcpy; // super fast memcpy with ssse3 instructions.
            else
              return default_memcpy;
          }

          void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
               __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_cpu_is (const char *CPUNAME)
     This function returns a positive integer if the run-time CPU is of
     type CPUNAME and returns '0' otherwise.  The following CPU names
     can be detected:

     'intel'
          Intel CPU.

          AMD Family 16h CPU.

     Here is an example:
          if (__builtin_cpu_is ("corei7"))
            {
               do_corei7 (); // Core i7 specific implementation.
            }
          else
            {
               do_generic (); // Generic implementation.
            }

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_cpu_supports (const char *FEATURE)

     Here is an example:
          if (__builtin_cpu_supports ("popcnt"))
            {
               asm("popcnt %1,%0" : "=r"(count) : "rm"(n) : "cc");
            }
          else
            {
               count = generic_countbits (n); //generic implementation.
            }

6.57.12 X86 transaction memory intrinsics
-----------------------------------------

Hardware transactional memory intrinsics for i386.  These allow to use
memory transactions with RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory).  For
using HLE (Hardware Lock Elision) see *note x86 specific memory model
extensions for transactional memory:: instead.  This support is enabled
with the '-mrtm' option.

 A memory transaction commits all changes to memory in an atomic way, as
visible to other threads.  If the transaction fails it is rolled back
and all side effects discarded.

 Generally there is no guarantee that a memory transaction ever succeeds
and suitable fallback code always needs to be supplied.

 -- RTM Function: unsigned _xbegin ()
     Start a RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory) transaction.  Returns
     _XBEGIN_STARTED when the transaction started successfully (note
     this is not 0, so the constant has to be explicitely tested).  When
     the transaction aborts all side effects are undone and an abort
     code is returned.  There is no guarantee any transaction ever
     succeeds, so there always needs to be a valid tested fallback path.

     #include <immintrin.h>

     if ((status = _xbegin ()) == _XBEGIN_STARTED) {
         ... transaction code...
         _xend ();
     } else {
         ... non transactional fallback path...
     }

 Valid abort status bits (when the value is not '_XBEGIN_STARTED') are:

'_XABORT_EXPLICIT'
     Transaction explicitely aborted with '_xabort'.  The parameter
     passed to '_xabort' is available with '_XABORT_CODE(status)'
'_XABORT_RETRY'
     Transaction retry is possible.
'_XABORT_CONFLICT'
     Transaction abort due to a memory conflict with another thread
'_XABORT_CAPACITY'
     Transaction abort due to the transaction using too much memory
'_XABORT_DEBUG'
     Transaction abort due to a debug trap
'_XABORT_NESTED'
     Transaction abort in a inner nested transaction

 -- RTM Function: void _xend ()
     Commit the current transaction.  When no transaction is active this
     will fault.  All memory side effects of the transactions will
     become visible to other threads in an atomic matter.

 -- RTM Function: int _xtest ()
     Return a value not zero when a transaction is currently active,
     otherwise 0.

 -- RTM Function: void _xabort (status)
     Abort the current transaction.  When no transaction is active this
     is a no-op.  status must be a 8bit constant, that is included in
     the status code returned by '_xbegin'

6.57.13 MIPS DSP Built-in Functions
-----------------------------------

The MIPS DSP Application-Specific Extension (ASE) includes new
instructions that are designed to improve the performance of DSP and
media applications.  It provides instructions that operate on packed
8-bit/16-bit integer data, Q7, Q15 and Q31 fractional data.

 GCC supports MIPS DSP operations using both the generic vector
extensions (*note Vector Extensions::) and a collection of MIPS-specific
built-in functions.  Both kinds of support are enabled by the '-mdsp'
command-line option.

 Revision 2 of the ASE was introduced in the second half of 2006.  This
revision adds extra instructions to the original ASE, but is otherwise
backwards-compatible with it.  You can select revision 2 using the
command-line option '-mdspr2'; this option implies '-mdsp'.

 The SCOUNT and POS bits of the DSP control register are global.  The
WRDSP, EXTPDP, EXTPDPV and MTHLIP instructions modify the SCOUNT and POS
bits.  During optimization, the compiler does not delete these
instructions and it does not delete calls to functions containing these
instructions.

 At present, GCC only provides support for operations on 32-bit vectors.
The vector type associated with 8-bit integer data is usually called
'v4i8', the vector type associated with Q7 is usually called 'v4q7', the
vector type associated with 16-bit integer data is usually called
'v2i16', and the vector type associated with Q15 is usually called
'v2q15'.  They can be defined in C as follows:

     typedef signed char v4i8 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
     typedef signed char v4q7 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
     typedef short v2i16 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));
     typedef short v2q15 __attribute__ ((vector_size(4)));

 'v4i8', 'v4q7', 'v2i16' and 'v2q15' values are initialized in the same
way as aggregates.  For example:

     v4i8 a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
     v4i8 b;
     b = (v4i8) {5, 6, 7, 8};

     v2q15 c = {0x0fcb, 0x3a75};
     v2q15 d;
     d = (v2q15) {0.1234 * 0x1.0p15, 0.4567 * 0x1.0p15};

 _Note:_ The CPU's endianness determines the order in which values are
packed.  On little-endian targets, the first value is the least
significant and the last value is the most significant.  The opposite
order applies to big-endian targets.  For example, the code above sets
the lowest byte of 'a' to '1' on little-endian targets and '4' on
big-endian targets.

 _Note:_ Q7, Q15 and Q31 values must be initialized with their integer
representation.  As shown in this example, the integer representation of
a Q7 value can be obtained by multiplying the fractional value by
'0x1.0p7'.  The equivalent for Q15 values is to multiply by '0x1.0p15'.
The equivalent for Q31 values is to multiply by '0x1.0p31'.

 The table below lists the 'v4i8' and 'v2q15' operations for which
hardware support exists.  'a' and 'b' are 'v4i8' values, and 'c' and 'd'
are 'v2q15' values.

C code                               MIPS instruction
'a + b'                              'addu.qb'
'c + d'                              'addq.ph'
'a - b'                              'subu.qb'
'c - d'                              'subq.ph'

 The table below lists the 'v2i16' operation for which hardware support
exists for the DSP ASE REV 2.  'e' and 'f' are 'v2i16' values.

C code                               MIPS instruction
'e * f'                              'mul.ph'

 It is easier to describe the DSP built-in functions if we first define
the following types:

     typedef int q31;
     typedef int i32;
     typedef unsigned int ui32;
     typedef long long a64;

 'q31' and 'i32' are actually the same as 'int', but we use 'q31' to
indicate a Q31 fractional value and 'i32' to indicate a 32-bit integer
value.  Similarly, 'a64' is the same as 'long long', but we use 'a64' to
indicate values that are placed in one of the four DSP accumulators
('$ac0', '$ac1', '$ac2' or '$ac3').

 Also, some built-in functions prefer or require immediate numbers as
parameters, because the corresponding DSP instructions accept both
immediate numbers and register operands, or accept immediate numbers
only.  The immediate parameters are listed as follows.

     imm0_3: 0 to 3.
     imm0_7: 0 to 7.
     imm0_15: 0 to 15.
     imm0_31: 0 to 31.
     imm0_63: 0 to 63.
     imm0_255: 0 to 255.
     imm_n32_31: -32 to 31.
     imm_n512_511: -512 to 511.

 The following built-in functions map directly to a particular MIPS DSP

6.57.14 MIPS Paired-Single Support
----------------------------------

The MIPS64 architecture includes a number of instructions that operate
on pairs of single-precision floating-point values.  Each pair is packed
into a 64-bit floating-point register, with one element being designated
the "upper half" and the other being designated the "lower half".

 GCC supports paired-single operations using both the generic vector
extensions (*note Vector Extensions::) and a collection of MIPS-specific
built-in functions.  Both kinds of support are enabled by the
'-mpaired-single' command-line option.

 The vector type associated with paired-single values is usually called
'v2sf'.  It can be defined in C as follows:

     typedef float v2sf __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));

 'v2sf' values are initialized in the same way as aggregates.  For
example:

     v2sf a = {1.5, 9.1};
     v2sf b;
     float e, f;
     b = (v2sf) {e, f};

 _Note:_ The CPU's endianness determines which value is stored in the
upper half of a register and which value is stored in the lower half.
On little-endian targets, the first value is the lower one and the
second value is the upper one.  The opposite order applies to big-endian
targets.  For example, the code above sets the lower half of 'a' to
'1.5' on little-endian targets and '9.1' on big-endian targets.

6.57.15 MIPS Loongson Built-in Functions
----------------------------------------

GCC provides intrinsics to access the SIMD instructions provided by the
ST Microelectronics Loongson-2E and -2F processors.  These intrinsics,
available after inclusion of the 'loongson.h' header file, operate on
the following 64-bit vector types:

   * 'uint8x8_t', a vector of eight unsigned 8-bit integers;
   * 'uint16x4_t', a vector of four unsigned 16-bit integers;
   * 'uint32x2_t', a vector of two unsigned 32-bit integers;
   * 'int8x8_t', a vector of eight signed 8-bit integers;
   * 'int16x4_t', a vector of four signed 16-bit integers;
   * 'int32x2_t', a vector of two signed 32-bit integers.

 The intrinsics provided are listed below; each is named after the
machine instruction to which it corresponds, with suffixes added as
appropriate to distinguish intrinsics that expand to the same machine
instruction yet have different argument types.  Refer to the
architecture documentation for a description of the functionality of
each instruction.

6.57.15.2 Paired-Single Built-in Functions
..........................................

The following paired-single functions map directly to a particular MIPS
instruction.  Please refer to the architecture specification for details
on what each instruction does.

'v2sf __builtin_mips_pll_ps (v2sf, v2sf)'
     Pair lower lower ('pll.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_pul_ps (v2sf, v2sf)'
     Pair upper lower ('pul.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_plu_ps (v2sf, v2sf)'
     Pair lower upper ('plu.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_puu_ps (v2sf, v2sf)'
     Pair upper upper ('puu.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_cvt_ps_s (float, float)'
     Convert pair to paired single ('cvt.ps.s').

'float __builtin_mips_cvt_s_pl (v2sf)'
     Convert pair lower to single ('cvt.s.pl').

'float __builtin_mips_cvt_s_pu (v2sf)'
     Convert pair upper to single ('cvt.s.pu').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_abs_ps (v2sf)'
     Absolute value ('abs.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_alnv_ps (v2sf, v2sf, int)'
     Align variable ('alnv.ps').

     _Note:_ The value of the third parameter must be 0 or 4 modulo 8,
     otherwise the result is unpredictable.  Please read the instruction
     description for details.

 The following multi-instruction functions are also available.  In each
case, COND can be any of the 16 floating-point conditions: 'f', 'un',
'eq', 'ueq', 'olt', 'ult', 'ole', 'ule', 'sf', 'ngle', 'seq', 'ngl',
'lt', 'nge', 'le' or 'ngt'.

'v2sf __builtin_mips_movt_c_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
'v2sf __builtin_mips_movf_c_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
     Conditional move based on floating-point comparison ('c.COND.ps',
     'movt.ps'/'movf.ps').

     The 'movt' functions return the value X computed by:

          c.COND.ps CC,A,B
          mov.ps X,C
          movt.ps X,D,CC

     The 'movf' functions are similar but use 'movf.ps' instead of
     'movt.ps'.

'int __builtin_mips_upper_c_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
'int __builtin_mips_lower_c_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
     Comparison of two paired-single values ('c.COND.ps',
     'bc1t'/'bc1f').

     These functions compare A and B using 'c.COND.ps' and return either
     the upper or lower half of the result.  For example:

          v2sf a, b;
          if (__builtin_mips_upper_c_eq_ps (a, b))
            upper_halves_are_equal ();
          else
            upper_halves_are_unequal ();

          if (__builtin_mips_lower_c_eq_ps (a, b))
            lower_halves_are_equal ();
          else
            lower_halves_are_unequal ();

of 3D graphics operations.  Support for these instructions is controlled
by the '-mips3d' command-line option.

 The functions listed below map directly to a particular MIPS-3D
instruction.  Please refer to the architecture specification for more
details on what each instruction does.

     Reduction add ('addr.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_mulr_ps (v2sf, v2sf)'
     Reduction multiply ('mulr.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_cvt_pw_ps (v2sf)'
     Convert paired single to paired word ('cvt.pw.ps').

'v2sf __builtin_mips_cvt_ps_pw (v2sf)'
     Convert paired word to paired single ('cvt.ps.pw').

     Reduced-precision reciprocal square root (sequence step 2)
     ('rsqrt2.FMT').

 The following multi-instruction functions are also available.  In each
case, COND can be any of the 16 floating-point conditions: 'f', 'un',
'eq', 'ueq', 'olt', 'ult', 'ole', 'ule', 'sf', 'ngle', 'seq', 'ngl',
'lt', 'nge', 'le' or 'ngt'.

'int __builtin_mips_cabs_COND_s (float A, float B)'
'int __builtin_mips_cabs_COND_d (double A, double B)'
     Absolute comparison of two scalar values ('cabs.COND.FMT',
     'bc1t'/'bc1f').

     These functions compare A and B using 'cabs.COND.s' or
     'cabs.COND.d' and return the result as a boolean value.  For
     example:

          float a, b;
          if (__builtin_mips_cabs_eq_s (a, b))
            true ();
          else
            false ();

'int __builtin_mips_upper_cabs_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
'int __builtin_mips_lower_cabs_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
     Absolute comparison of two paired-single values ('cabs.COND.ps',
     'bc1t'/'bc1f').

     These functions compare A and B using 'cabs.COND.ps' and return
     either the upper or lower half of the result.  For example:

          v2sf a, b;
          if (__builtin_mips_upper_cabs_eq_ps (a, b))
            upper_halves_are_equal ();
          else
            upper_halves_are_unequal ();

          if (__builtin_mips_lower_cabs_eq_ps (a, b))
            lower_halves_are_equal ();
          else
            lower_halves_are_unequal ();

'v2sf __builtin_mips_movt_cabs_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
'v2sf __builtin_mips_movf_cabs_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
     Conditional move based on absolute comparison ('cabs.COND.ps',
     'movt.ps'/'movf.ps').

     The 'movt' functions return the value X computed by:

          cabs.COND.ps CC,A,B
          mov.ps X,C
          movt.ps X,D,CC

     The 'movf' functions are similar but use 'movf.ps' instead of
     'movt.ps'.

'int __builtin_mips_any_c_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
'int __builtin_mips_all_c_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
'int __builtin_mips_any_cabs_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
'int __builtin_mips_all_cabs_COND_ps (v2sf A, v2sf B)'
     Comparison of two paired-single values ('c.COND.ps'/'cabs.COND.ps',
     'bc1any2t'/'bc1any2f').

     These functions compare A and B using 'c.COND.ps' or
     'cabs.COND.ps'.  The 'any' forms return true if either result is
     true and the 'all' forms return true if both results are true.  For
     example:

          v2sf a, b;
          if (__builtin_mips_any_c_eq_ps (a, b))
            one_is_true ();
          else
            both_are_false ();

          if (__builtin_mips_all_c_eq_ps (a, b))
            both_are_true ();
          else
            one_is_false ();

'int __builtin_mips_any_c_COND_4s (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
'int __builtin_mips_all_c_COND_4s (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
'int __builtin_mips_any_cabs_COND_4s (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
'int __builtin_mips_all_cabs_COND_4s (v2sf A, v2sf B, v2sf C, v2sf D)'
     Comparison of four paired-single values
     ('c.COND.ps'/'cabs.COND.ps', 'bc1any4t'/'bc1any4f').

     These functions use 'c.COND.ps' or 'cabs.COND.ps' to compare A with
     B and to compare C with D.  The 'any' forms return true if any of
     the four results are true and the 'all' forms return true if all
     four results are true.  For example:

          v2sf a, b, c, d;
          if (__builtin_mips_any_c_eq_4s (a, b, c, d))
            some_are_true ();
          else
            all_are_false ();

          if (__builtin_mips_all_c_eq_4s (a, b, c, d))
            all_are_true ();
          else
            some_are_false ();

6.57.16 Other MIPS Built-in Functions
-------------------------------------

GCC provides other MIPS-specific built-in functions:

'void __builtin_mips_cache (int OP, const volatile void *ADDR)'
     Insert a 'cache' instruction with operands OP and ADDR.  GCC
     defines the preprocessor macro '___GCC_HAVE_BUILTIN_MIPS_CACHE'
     when this function is available.

'unsigned int __builtin_mips_get_fcsr (void)'
'void __builtin_mips_set_fcsr (unsigned int VALUE)'
     Get and set the contents of the floating-point control and status
     register (FPU control register 31).  These functions are only
     available in hard-float code but can be called in both MIPS16 and
     non-MIPS16 contexts.

     '__builtin_mips_set_fcsr' can be used to change any bit of the
     register except the condition codes, which GCC assumes are
     preserved.

6.57.17 MSP430 Built-in Functions
---------------------------------

GCC provides a couple of special builtin functions to aid in the writing
of interrupt handlers in C.

'__bic_SR_register_on_exit (int MASK)'
     This clears the indicated bits in the saved copy of the status
     register currently residing on the stack.  This only works inside
     interrupt handlers and the changes to the status register will only
     take affect once the handler returns.

'__bis_SR_register_on_exit (int MASK)'
     This sets the indicated bits in the saved copy of the status
     register currently residing on the stack.  This only works inside
     interrupt handlers and the changes to the status register will only
     take affect once the handler returns.

6.57.19 picoChip Built-in Functions
-----------------------------------

GCC provides an interface to selected machine instructions from the
picoChip instruction set.

'int __builtin_sbc (int VALUE)'
     Sign bit count.  Return the number of consecutive bits in VALUE
     that have the same value as the sign bit.  The result is the number
     of leading sign bits minus one, giving the number of redundant sign
     bits in VALUE.

     on.

'int __builtin_adds (int X, int Y)'
     Saturating addition.  Return the result of adding X and Y, storing
     the value 32767 if the result overflows.

'int __builtin_subs (int X, int Y)'
     Saturating subtraction.  Return the result of subtracting Y from X,
     storing the value -32768 if the result overflows.

6.57.20 PowerPC Built-in Functions
----------------------------------

These built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family of
processors:
     float __builtin_recipdivf (float, float);
     float __builtin_rsqrtf (float);
     double __builtin_recipdiv (double, double);
     double __builtin_rsqrt (double);
     uint64_t __builtin_ppc_get_timebase ();
     unsigned long __builtin_ppc_mftb ();
     double __builtin_unpack_longdouble (long double, int);
     long double __builtin_pack_longdouble (double, double);

 The 'vec_rsqrt', '__builtin_rsqrt', and '__builtin_rsqrtf' functions
generate multiple instructions to implement the reciprocal sqrt
functionality using reciprocal sqrt estimate instructions.

 The '__builtin_recipdiv', and '__builtin_recipdivf' functions generate
multiple instructions to implement division using the reciprocal
estimate instructions.

 The '__builtin_ppc_get_timebase' and '__builtin_ppc_mftb' functions
generate instructions to read the Time Base Register.  The
'__builtin_ppc_get_timebase' function may generate multiple instructions
and always returns the 64 bits of the Time Base Register.  The
'__builtin_ppc_mftb' function always generates one instruction and
returns the Time Base Register value as an unsigned long, throwing away
the most significant word on 32-bit environments.

 The following built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family
of processors, starting with ISA 2.06 or later ('-mcpu=power7' or
'-mpopcntd'):

     unsigned int cdtbcd (unsigned int);
     unsigned int cbcdtd (unsigned int);
     unsigned int addg6s (unsigned int, unsigned int);

 The '__builtin_divde', '__builtin_divdeo', '__builitin_divdeu',
'__builtin_divdeou' functions require a 64-bit environment support ISA
2.06 or later.

 The following built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family
of processors when hardware decimal floating point ('-mhard-dfp') is
available:
     _Decimal64 __builtin_dxex (_Decimal64);

6.57.21 PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions
------------------------------------------

GCC provides an interface for the PowerPC family of processors to access
the AltiVec operations described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.  The interface is made available by including
'<altivec.h>' and using '-maltivec' and '-mabi=altivec'.  The interface
supports the following vector types.

     vector unsigned char
     vector signed char
     vector bool char

     vector unsigned short
     vector signed short
     vector bool short
     vector pixel

     vector unsigned int
     vector signed int
     vector bool int
     vector float

 If '-mvsx' is used the following additional vector types are
implemented.

     vector unsigned long
     vector signed long
     vector double

 The long types are only implemented for 64-bit code generation, and the
long type is only used in the floating point/integer conversion
instructions.

 GCC's implementation of the high-level language interface available
from C and C++ code differs from Motorola's documentation in several
ways.

   * A vector constant is a list of constant expressions within curly
     braces.

   * A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of
     the same type as the variable it is initializing.

   * If 'signed' or 'unsigned' is omitted, the signedness of the vector
     type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
     varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program
     should always specify the signedness.

   * Compiling with '-maltivec' adds keywords '__vector', 'vector',
     '__pixel', 'pixel', '__bool' and 'bool'.  When compiling ISO C, the
     context-sensitive substitution of the keywords 'vector', 'pixel'
     and 'bool' is disabled.  To use them, you must include
     '<altivec.h>' instead.

   * GCC allows using a 'typedef' name as the type specifier for a
     vector type.

   * For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the
     following does not work:

            vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

     Since 'vec_add' is a macro, the vector constant in the example is
     treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
     parentheses for this to work.

 _Note:_ Only the '<altivec.h>' interface is supported.  Internally, GCC
uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in the
aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are subject
to change without notice.

 The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there is
a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.

 Arguments that are documented as 'const int' require literal integral
values within the range required for that operation.

 Note that the 'vec_ld' and 'vec_st' built-in functions always generate
the AltiVec 'LVX' and 'STVX' instructions even if the VSX instruction
set is available.  The 'vec_vsx_ld' and 'vec_vsx_st' built-in functions
always generate the VSX 'LXVD2X', 'LXVW4X', 'STXVD2X', and 'STXVW4X'
instructions.

 If the ISA 2.07 additions to the vector/scalar (power8-vector)
instruction set is available, the following additional functions are
available for both 32-bit and 64-bit targets.  For 64-bit targets, you
can use VECTOR LONG instead of VECTOR LONG LONG, VECTOR BOOL LONG
instead of VECTOR BOOL LONG LONG, and VECTOR UNSIGNED LONG instead of
VECTOR UNSIGNED LONG LONG.

 If the ISA 2.07 additions to the vector/scalar (power8-vector)
instruction set is available, the following additional functions are
available for 64-bit targets.  New vector types (VECTOR __INT128_T and
VECTOR __UINT128_T) are available to hold the __INT128_T and __UINT128_T
types to use these builtins.

 The normal vector extract, and set operations work on VECTOR __INT128_T
and VECTOR __UINT128_T types, but the index value must be 0.

that is 0 or 1.  The third argument to these builtin functions must be a
constant integer in the range of 0 to 15.

6.57.22 PowerPC Hardware Transactional Memory Built-in Functions
----------------------------------------------------------------

GCC provides two interfaces for accessing the Hardware Transactional
Memory (HTM) instructions available on some of the PowerPC family of
prcoessors (eg, POWER8).  The two interfaces come in a low level
interface, consisting of built-in functions specific to PowerPC and a
higher level interface consisting of inline functions that are common
between PowerPC and S/390.

6.57.22.1 PowerPC HTM Low Level Built-in Functions
..................................................

The following low level built-in functions are available with '-mhtm' or
'-mcpu=CPU' where CPU is 'power8' or later.  They all generate the
machine instruction that is part of the name.

 The HTM built-ins return true or false depending on their success and
their arguments match exactly the type and order of the associated
hardware instruction's operands.  Refer to the ISA manual for a
description of each instruction's operands.

     unsigned int __builtin_tbegin (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tend (unsigned int)

     unsigned int __builtin_tabort (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)

     unsigned int __builtin_tcheck (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_treclaim (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_trechkpt (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsr (unsigned int)

 In addition to the above HTM built-ins, we have added built-ins for
some common extended mnemonics of the HTM instructions:

     unsigned int __builtin_tendall (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tresume (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsuspend (void)

 The following set of built-in functions are available to gain access to
the HTM specific special purpose registers.

     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasr (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasru (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfhar (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfiar (void)

     void __builtin_set_texasr (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_texasru (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfhar (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfiar (unsigned long);

 Example usage of these low level built-in functions may look like:

     #include <htmintrin.h>

     int num_retries = 10;

     while (1)
       {
         if (__builtin_tbegin (0))
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __builtin_tabort (0);
             ... transaction code...
             __builtin_tend (0);
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- <= 0
                 || _TEXASRU_FAILURE_PERSISTENT (__builtin_get_texasru ()))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

 One final built-in function has been added that returns the value of
the 2-bit Transaction State field of the Machine Status Register (MSR)
as stored in 'CR0'.

     unsigned long __builtin_ttest (void)

 This built-in can be used to determine the current transaction state
using the following code example:

     #include <htmintrin.h>

     unsigned char tx_state = _HTM_STATE (__builtin_ttest ());

     if (tx_state == _HTM_TRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_NONTRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in non-transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_SUSPENDED)
       {
         /* Code to use in transaction suspended state.  */
       }

6.57.22.2 PowerPC HTM High Level Inline Functions
.................................................

The following high level HTM interface is made available by including
'<htmxlintrin.h>' and using '-mhtm' or '-mcpu=CPU' where CPU is 'power8'
or later.  This interface is common between PowerPC and S/390, allowing
users to write one HTM source implementation that can be compiled and
executed on either system.

     long __TM_simple_begin (void)
     long __TM_begin (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_end (void)
     void __TM_abort (void)
     void __TM_named_abort (unsigned char const code)
     void __TM_resume (void)
     void __TM_suspend (void)

     long __TM_is_user_abort (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_named_user_abort (void* const TM_buff, unsigned char *code)
     long __TM_is_illegal (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_footprint_exceeded (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_nesting_depth (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_nested_too_deep(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_conflict(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_failure_persistent(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_failure_address(void* const TM_buff)
     long long __TM_failure_code(void* const TM_buff)

 Using these common set of HTM inline functions, we can create a more
portable version of the HTM example in the previous section that will
work on either PowerPC or S/390:

     #include <htmxlintrin.h>

     int num_retries = 10;
     TM_buff_type TM_buff;

     while (1)
       {
         if (__TM_begin (TM_buff))
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __TM_abort ();
             ... transaction code...
             __TM_end ();
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- <= 0
                 || __TM_is_failure_persistent (TM_buff))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

6.57.24 S/390 System z Built-in Functions
-----------------------------------------

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin (void*)
     Generates the 'tbegin' machine instruction starting a
     non-constraint hardware transaction.  If the parameter is non-NULL
     the memory area is used to store the transaction diagnostic buffer
     and will be passed as first operand to 'tbegin'.  This buffer can
     be defined using the 'struct __htm_tdb' C struct defined in
     'htmintrin.h' and must reside on a double-word boundary.  The
     second tbegin operand is set to '0xff0c'.  This enables
     save/restore of all GPRs and disables aborts for FPR and AR
     manipulations inside the transaction body.  The condition code set
     by the tbegin instruction is returned as integer value.  The tbegin
     instruction by definition overwrites the content of all FPRs.  The
     compiler will generate code which saves and restores the FPRs.  For
     soft-float code it is recommended to used the '*_nofloat' variant.
     In order to prevent a TDB from being written it is required to pass
     an constant zero value as parameter.  Passing the zero value
     through a variable is not sufficient.  Although modifications of
     access registers inside the transaction will not trigger an
     transaction abort it is not supported to actually modify them.
     Access registers do not get saved when entering a transaction.
     They will have undefined state when reaching the abort code.

 Macros for the possible return codes of tbegin are defined in the
'htmintrin.h' header file:

'_HTM_TBEGIN_STARTED'
     'tbegin' has been executed as part of normal processing.  The
     transaction body is supposed to be executed.
'_HTM_TBEGIN_INDETERMINATE'
     The transaction was aborted due to an indeterminate condition which
     might be persistent.
'_HTM_TBEGIN_TRANSIENT'
     The transaction aborted due to a transient failure.  The
     transaction should be re-executed in that case.
'_HTM_TBEGIN_PERSISTENT'
     The transaction aborted due to a persistent failure.  Re-execution
     under same circumstances will not be productive.

 -- Macro: _HTM_FIRST_USER_ABORT_CODE
     The '_HTM_FIRST_USER_ABORT_CODE' defined in 'htmintrin.h' specifies
     the first abort code which can be used for '__builtin_tabort'.
     Values below this threshold are reserved for machine use.

 -- Data type: struct __htm_tdb
     The 'struct __htm_tdb' defined in 'htmintrin.h' describes the
     structure of the transaction diagnostic block as specified in the
     Principles of Operation manual chapter 5-91.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_nofloat (void*)
     Same as '__builtin_tbegin' but without FPR saves and restores.
     Using this variant in code making use of FPRs will leave the FPRs
     in undefined state when entering the transaction abort handler
     code.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_retry (void*, int)
     In addition to '__builtin_tbegin' a loop for transient failures is
     generated.  If tbegin returns a condition code of 2 the transaction
     will be retried as often as specified in the second argument.  The
     perform processor assist instruction is used to tell the CPU about
     the number of fails so far.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_retry_nofloat (void*, int)
     Same as '__builtin_tbegin_retry' but without FPR saves and
     restores.  Using this variant in code making use of FPRs will leave
     the FPRs in undefined state when entering the transaction abort
     handler code.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tbeginc (void)
     Generates the 'tbeginc' machine instruction starting a constraint
     hardware transaction.  The second operand is set to '0xff08'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tend (void)
     Generates the 'tend' machine instruction finishing a transaction
     and making the changes visible to other threads.  The condition
     code generated by tend is returned as integer value.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tabort (int)
     Generates the 'tabort' machine instruction with the specified abort
     code.  Abort codes from 0 through 255 are reserved and will result
     in an error message.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tx_assist (int)
     Generates the 'ppa rX,rY,1' machine instruction.  Where the integer
     parameter is loaded into rX and a value of zero is loaded into rY.
     The integer parameter specifies the number of times the transaction
     repeatedly aborted.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tx_nesting_depth (void)
     Generates the 'etnd' machine instruction.  The current nesting
     depth is returned as integer value.  For a nesting depth of 0 the
     code is not executed as part of an transaction.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_non_tx_store (uint64_t *,
          uint64_t)

     Generates the 'ntstg' machine instruction.  The second argument is
     written to the first arguments location.  The store operation will
     not be rolled-back in case of an transaction abort.

6.57.25 SH Built-in Functions
-----------------------------

The following built-in functions are supported on the SH1, SH2, SH3 and
SH4 families of processors:

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_set_thread_pointer (void *PTR)
     Sets the 'GBR' register to the specified value PTR.  This is
     usually used by system code that manages threads and execution
     contexts.  The compiler normally does not generate code that
     modifies the contents of 'GBR' and thus the value is preserved
     across function calls.  Changing the 'GBR' value in user code must
     be done with caution, since the compiler might use 'GBR' in order
     to access thread local variables.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_thread_pointer (void)
     Returns the value that is currently set in the 'GBR' register.
     Memory loads and stores that use the thread pointer as a base
     address are turned into 'GBR' based displacement loads and stores,
     if possible.  For example:
          struct my_tcb
          {
             int a, b, c, d, e;
          };

          int get_tcb_value (void)
          {
            // Generate 'mov.l @(8,gbr),r0' instruction
            return ((my_tcb*)__builtin_thread_pointer ())->c;
          }

functions also become available:

     void __builtin_vis_cmask8 (long);

6.57.27 SPU Built-in Functions
------------------------------

GCC provides extensions for the SPU processor as described in the
Sony/Toshiba/IBM SPU Language Extensions Specification, which can be
found at <http://cell.scei.co.jp/> or
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell/>.  GCC's implementation
differs in several ways.

   * The optional extension of specifying vector constants in
     parentheses is not supported.

   * A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of
     the same type as the variable it is initializing.

   * If 'signed' or 'unsigned' is omitted, the signedness of the vector
     type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
     varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program
     should always specify the signedness.

   * By default, the keyword '__vector' is added.  The macro 'vector' is
     defined in '<spu_intrinsics.h>' and can be undefined.

   * GCC allows using a 'typedef' name as the type specifier for a
     vector type.

   * For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the
     following does not work:

            spu_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

     Since 'spu_add' is a macro, the vector constant in the example is
     treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
     parentheses for this to work.

   * The extended version of '__builtin_expect' is not supported.

 _Note:_ Only the interface described in the aforementioned
specification is supported.  Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to
implement the required functionality, but these are not supported and
are subject to change without notice.

6.58 Format Checks Specific to Particular Target Machines
=========================================================

For some target machines, GCC supports additional options to the format
attribute (*note Declaring Attributes of Functions: Function
Attributes.).

* Menu:

* Solaris Format Checks::
* Darwin Format Checks::


File: gcc.info,  Node: Solaris Format Checks,  Next: Darwin Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

6.58.1 Solaris Format Checks
----------------------------

Solaris targets support the 'cmn_err' (or '__cmn_err__') format check.
'cmn_err' accepts a subset of the standard 'printf' conversions, and the
two-argument '%b' conversion for displaying bit-fields.  See the Solaris
man page for 'cmn_err' for more information.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Darwin Format Checks,  Prev: Solaris Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

6.58.2 Darwin Format Checks
---------------------------

Darwin targets support the 'CFString' (or '__CFString__') in the format
attribute context.  Declarations made with such attribution are parsed
for correct syntax and format argument types.  However, parsing of the
format string itself is currently undefined and is not carried out by
this version of the compiler.

 Additionally, 'CFStringRefs' (defined by the 'CoreFoundation' headers)
may also be used as format arguments.  Note that the relevant headers
are only likely to be available on Darwin (OSX) installations.  On such
installations, the XCode and system documentation provide descriptions
of 'CFString', 'CFStringRefs' and associated functions.

6.59 Pragmas Accepted by GCC
============================

GCC supports several types of pragmas, primarily in order to compile
code originally written for other compilers.  Note that in general we do
not recommend the use of pragmas; *Note Function Attributes::, for
further explanation.

* Menu:

* ARM Pragmas::

File: gcc.info,  Node: ARM Pragmas,  Next: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.1 ARM Pragmas
------------------

The ARM target defines pragmas for controlling the default addition of
'long_call' and 'short_call' attributes to functions.  *Note Function
Attributes::, for information about the effects of these attributes.

'long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the 'long_call' attribute.

'no_long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the 'short_call' attribute.

'long_calls_off'
     Do not affect the 'long_call' or 'short_call' attributes of
     subsequent functions.


File: gcc.info,  Node: M32C Pragmas,  Next: MeP Pragmas,  Prev: ARM Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.2 M32C Pragmas
-------------------

'GCC memregs NUMBER'
     Overrides the command-line option '-memregs=' for the current file.
     Use with care!  This pragma must be before any function in the
     file, and mixing different memregs values in different objects may
     make them incompatible.  This pragma is useful when a
     performance-critical function uses a memreg for temporary values,
     as it may allow you to reduce the number of memregs used.

'ADDRESS NAME ADDRESS'
     For any declared symbols matching NAME, this does three things to
     that symbol: it forces the symbol to be located at the given
     address (a number), it forces the symbol to be volatile, and it
     changes the symbol's scope to be static.  This pragma exists for
     compatibility with other compilers, but note that the common
     '1234H' numeric syntax is not supported (use '0x1234' instead).
     Example:

          #pragma ADDRESS port3 0x103
          char port3;


File: gcc.info,  Node: MeP Pragmas,  Next: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Prev: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.3 MeP Pragmas
------------------

'custom io_volatile (on|off)'
     Overrides the command-line option '-mio-volatile' for the current
     file.  Note that for compatibility with future GCC releases, this
     option should only be used once before any 'io' variables in each
     file.

'GCC coprocessor available REGISTERS'
     Specifies which coprocessor registers are available to the register
     allocator.  REGISTERS may be a single register, register range
     separated by ellipses, or comma-separated list of those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor available $c0...$c10, $c28

'GCC coprocessor call_saved REGISTERS'
     Specifies which coprocessor registers are to be saved and restored
     by any function using them.  REGISTERS may be a single register,
     register range separated by ellipses, or comma-separated list of
     those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor call_saved $c4...$c6, $c31

'GCC coprocessor subclass '(A|B|C|D)' = REGISTERS'
     Creates and defines a register class.  These register classes can
     be used by inline 'asm' constructs.  REGISTERS may be a single
     register, register range separated by ellipses, or comma-separated
     list of those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor subclass 'B' = $c2, $c4, $c6

          asm ("cpfoo %0" : "=B" (x));

'GCC disinterrupt NAME , NAME ...'
     For the named functions, the compiler adds code to disable
     interrupts for the duration of those functions.  If any functions
     so named are not encountered in the source, a warning is emitted
     that the pragma is not used.  Examples:

          #pragma disinterrupt foo
          #pragma disinterrupt bar, grill
          int foo () { ... }

'GCC call NAME , NAME ...'
     For the named functions, the compiler always uses a
     register-indirect call model when calling the named functions.
     Examples:

          extern int foo ();
          #pragma call foo

6.59.4 RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas
----------------------------------

The RS/6000 and PowerPC targets define one pragma for controlling
whether or not the 'longcall' attribute is added to function
declarations by default.  This pragma overrides the '-mlongcall' option,
but not the 'longcall' and 'shortcall' attributes.  *Note RS/6000 and
PowerPC Options::, for more information about when long calls are and
are not necessary.

'longcall (1)'
     Apply the 'longcall' attribute to all subsequent function
     declarations.

'longcall (0)'
     Do not apply the 'longcall' attribute to subsequent function
     declarations.

6.59.5 Darwin Pragmas
---------------------

The following pragmas are available for all architectures running the
Darwin operating system.  These are useful for compatibility with other
Mac OS compilers.

'mark TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

'options align=ALIGNMENT'
     This pragma sets the alignment of fields in structures.  The values
     of ALIGNMENT may be 'mac68k', to emulate m68k alignment, or
     'power', to emulate PowerPC alignment.  Uses of this pragma nest
     properly; to restore the previous setting, use 'reset' for the
     ALIGNMENT.

'segment TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

'unused (VAR [, VAR]...)'
     This pragma declares variables to be possibly unused.  GCC does not
     produce warnings for the listed variables.  The effect is similar
     to that of the 'unused' attribute, except that this pragma may
     appear anywhere within the variables' scopes.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Solaris Pragmas,  Next: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Prev: Darwin Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.6 Solaris Pragmas
----------------------

The Solaris target supports '#pragma redefine_extname' (*note
Symbol-Renaming Pragmas::).  It also supports additional '#pragma'
directives for compatibility with the system compiler.

'align ALIGNMENT (VARIABLE [, VARIABLE]...)'

     Increase the minimum alignment of each VARIABLE to ALIGNMENT.  This
     is the same as GCC's 'aligned' attribute *note Variable
     Attributes::).  Macro expansion occurs on the arguments to this
     pragma when compiling C and Objective-C.  It does not currently
     occur when compiling C++, but this is a bug which may be fixed in a
     future release.

'fini (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'

     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called after main, or
     during shared module unloading, by adding a call to the '.fini'
     section.

'init (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'

     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called during
     initialization (before 'main') or during shared module loading, by
     adding a call to the '.init' section.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Next: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Prev: Solaris Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.7 Symbol-Renaming Pragmas
------------------------------

For compatibility with the Solaris system headers, GCC supports two
'#pragma' directives that change the name used in assembly for a given
declaration.  To get this effect on all platforms supported by GCC, use
the asm labels extension (*note Asm Labels::).

'redefine_extname OLDNAME NEWNAME'

     This pragma gives the C function OLDNAME the assembly symbol
     NEWNAME.  The preprocessor macro '__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME' is
     defined if this pragma is available (currently on all platforms).

 This pragma and the asm labels extension interact in a complicated
manner.  Here are some corner cases you may want to be aware of.

  1. Both pragmas silently apply only to declarations with external
     linkage.  Asm labels do not have this restriction.

  2. In C++, both pragmas silently apply only to declarations with "C"
     linkage.  Again, asm labels do not have this restriction.

  3. If any of the three ways of changing the assembly name of a
     declaration is applied to a declaration whose assembly name has
     already been determined (either by a previous use of one of these
     features, or because the compiler needed the assembly name in order
     to generate code), and the new name is different, a warning issues
     and the name does not change.

  4. The OLDNAME used by '#pragma redefine_extname' is always the
     C-language name.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Next: Weak Pragmas,  Prev: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.8 Structure-Packing Pragmas
--------------------------------

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports a set
of '#pragma' directives that change the maximum alignment of members of
structures (other than zero-width bit-fields), unions, and classes
subsequently defined.  The N value below always is required to be a
small power of two and specifies the new alignment in bytes.

  1. '#pragma pack(N)' simply sets the new alignment.
  2. '#pragma pack()' sets the alignment to the one that was in effect
     when compilation started (see also command-line option
     '-fpack-struct[=N]' *note Code Gen Options::).
  3. '#pragma pack(push[,N])' pushes the current alignment setting on an
     internal stack and then optionally sets the new alignment.
  4. '#pragma pack(pop)' restores the alignment setting to the one saved
     at the top of the internal stack (and removes that stack entry).
     Note that '#pragma pack([N])' does not influence this internal
     stack; thus it is possible to have '#pragma pack(push)' followed by
     multiple '#pragma pack(N)' instances and finalized by a single
     '#pragma pack(pop)'.

 Some targets, e.g. i386 and PowerPC, support the 'ms_struct' '#pragma'
which lays out a structure as the documented '__attribute__
((ms_struct))'.
  1. '#pragma ms_struct on' turns on the layout for structures declared.
  2. '#pragma ms_struct off' turns off the layout for structures
     declared.
  3. '#pragma ms_struct reset' goes back to the default layout.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Weak Pragmas,  Next: Diagnostic Pragmas,  Prev: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.9 Weak Pragmas
-------------------

For compatibility with SVR4, GCC supports a set of '#pragma' directives
for declaring symbols to be weak, and defining weak aliases.

'#pragma weak SYMBOL'
     This pragma declares SYMBOL to be weak, as if the declaration had
     the attribute of the same name.  The pragma may appear before or
     after the declaration of SYMBOL.  It is not an error for SYMBOL to
     never be defined at all.

'#pragma weak SYMBOL1 = SYMBOL2'
     This pragma declares SYMBOL1 to be a weak alias of SYMBOL2.  It is
     an error if SYMBOL2 is not defined in the current translation unit.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Diagnostic Pragmas,  Next: Visibility Pragmas,  Prev: Weak Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.10 Diagnostic Pragmas
--------------------------

GCC allows the user to selectively enable or disable certain types of
diagnostics, and change the kind of the diagnostic.  For example, a
project's policy might require that all sources compile with '-Werror'
but certain files might have exceptions allowing specific types of
warnings.  Or, a project might selectively enable diagnostics and treat
them as errors depending on which preprocessor macros are defined.

'#pragma GCC diagnostic KIND OPTION'

     Modifies the disposition of a diagnostic.  Note that not all
     diagnostics are modifiable; at the moment only warnings (normally
     controlled by '-W...') can be controlled, and not all of them.  Use
     '-fdiagnostics-show-option' to determine which diagnostics are
     controllable and which option controls them.

     KIND is 'error' to treat this diagnostic as an error, 'warning' to
     treat it like a warning (even if '-Werror' is in effect), or
     'ignored' if the diagnostic is to be ignored.  OPTION is a double
     quoted string that matches the command-line option.

          #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wformat"

     Note that these pragmas override any command-line options.  GCC
     keeps track of the location of each pragma, and issues diagnostics
     according to the state as of that point in the source file.  Thus,
     pragmas occurring after a line do not affect diagnostics caused by
     that line.

'#pragma GCC diagnostic push'
'#pragma GCC diagnostic pop'

     Causes GCC to remember the state of the diagnostics as of each
     'push', and restore to that point at each 'pop'.  If a 'pop' has no
     matching 'push', the command-line options are restored.

          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(a);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic push
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(b);                       /* no diagnostic for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(c);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(d);                       /* depends on command-line options */

 GCC also offers a simple mechanism for printing messages during
compilation.

'#pragma message STRING'

     Prints STRING as a compiler message on compilation.  The message is
     informational only, and is neither a compilation warning nor an
     error.

          #pragma message "Compiling " __FILE__ "..."

     STRING may be parenthesized, and is printed with location
     information.  For example,

          #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
          #define TODO(x) DO_PRAGMA(message ("TODO - " #x))

          TODO(Remember to fix this)

     prints '/tmp/file.c:4: note: #pragma message: TODO - Remember to
     fix this'.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Visibility Pragmas,  Next: Push/Pop Macro Pragmas,  Prev: Diagnostic Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.11 Visibility Pragmas
--------------------------

'#pragma GCC visibility push(VISIBILITY)'
'#pragma GCC visibility pop'

     This pragma allows the user to set the visibility for multiple
     declarations without having to give each a visibility attribute
     *Note Function Attributes::, for more information about visibility
     and the attribute syntax.

     In C++, '#pragma GCC visibility' affects only namespace-scope
     declarations.  Class members and template specializations are not
     affected; if you want to override the visibility for a particular
     member or instantiation, you must use an attribute.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Push/Pop Macro Pragmas,  Next: Function Specific Option Pragmas,  Prev: Visibility Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.59.12 Push/Pop Macro Pragmas
------------------------------

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports
'#pragma push_macro("MACRO_NAME")' and '#pragma
pop_macro("MACRO_NAME")'.

'#pragma push_macro("MACRO_NAME")'
     This pragma saves the value of the macro named as MACRO_NAME to the
     top of the stack for this macro.

'#pragma pop_macro("MACRO_NAME")'
     This pragma sets the value of the macro named as MACRO_NAME to the
     value on top of the stack for this macro.  If the stack for
     MACRO_NAME is empty, the value of the macro remains unchanged.

 For example:

     #define X  1
     #pragma push_macro("X")
     #undef X
     #define X -1
     #pragma pop_macro("X")
     int x [X];

In this example, the definition of X as 1 is saved by '#pragma
push_macro' and restored by '#pragma pop_macro'.

6.59.13 Function Specific Option Pragmas
----------------------------------------

'#pragma GCC target ("STRING"...)'

     This pragma allows you to set target specific options for functions
     defined later in the source file.  One or more strings can be
     specified.  Each function that is defined after this point is as if
     'attribute((target("STRING")))' was specified for that function.
     The parenthesis around the options is optional.  *Note Function
     Attributes::, for more information about the 'target' attribute and
     the attribute syntax.

     The '#pragma GCC target' pragma is presently implemented for
     i386/x86_64, PowerPC, and Nios II targets only.

'#pragma GCC optimize ("STRING"...)'

     This pragma allows you to set global optimization options for
     functions defined later in the source file.  One or more strings
     can be specified.  Each function that is defined after this point
     is as if 'attribute((optimize("STRING")))' was specified for that
     function.  The parenthesis around the options is optional.  *Note
     Function Attributes::, for more information about the 'optimize'
     attribute and the attribute syntax.

     The '#pragma GCC optimize' pragma is not implemented in GCC
     versions earlier than 4.4.

'#pragma GCC push_options'
'#pragma GCC pop_options'

     These pragmas maintain a stack of the current target and
     optimization options.  It is intended for include files where you
     temporarily want to switch to using a different '#pragma GCC
     target' or '#pragma GCC optimize' and then to pop back to the
     previous options.

     The '#pragma GCC push_options' and '#pragma GCC pop_options'
     pragmas are not implemented in GCC versions earlier than 4.4.

'#pragma GCC reset_options'

     This pragma clears the current '#pragma GCC target' and '#pragma
     GCC optimize' to use the default switches as specified on the
     command line.

     The '#pragma GCC reset_options' pragma is not implemented in GCC
     versions earlier than 4.4.

6.59.14 Loop-Specific Pragmas
-----------------------------

'#pragma GCC ivdep'

 With this pragma, the programmer asserts that there are no loop-carried
dependencies which would prevent that consecutive iterations of the
following loop can be executed concurrently with SIMD (single
instruction multiple data) instructions.

 For example, the compiler can only unconditionally vectorize the
following loop with the pragma:

     void foo (int n, int *a, int *b, int *c)
     {
       int i, j;
     #pragma GCC ivdep
       for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
         a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
     }

In this example, using the 'restrict' qualifier had the same effect.  In
the following example, that would not be possible.  Assume k < -m or k
>= m.  Only with the pragma, the compiler knows that it can
unconditionally vectorize the following loop:

     void ignore_vec_dep (int *a, int k, int c, int m)
     {
     #pragma GCC ivdep
       for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
         a[i] = a[i + k] * c;
     }

6.60 Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions
======================================================

As permitted by ISO C11 and for compatibility with other compilers, GCC
allows you to define a structure or union that contains, as fields,
structures and unions without names.  For example:

     struct {
       int a;
       union {
         int b;
         float c;
       };
       int d;
     } foo;

In this example, you are able to access members of the unnamed union
with code like 'foo.b'.  Note that only unnamed structs and unions are
allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed 'int'.

 You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field
definitions.  For example, in this structure:

     struct {
       int a;
       struct {
         int a;
       };
     } foo;

it is ambiguous which 'a' is being referred to with 'foo.a'.  The
compiler gives errors for such constructs.

 Unless '-fms-extensions' is used, the unnamed field must be a structure
or union definition without a tag (for example, 'struct { int a; };').
If '-fms-extensions' is used, the field may also be a definition with a
tag such as 'struct foo { int a; };', a reference to a previously
defined structure or union such as 'struct foo;', or a reference to a
'typedef' name for a previously defined structure or union type.

 The option '-fplan9-extensions' enables '-fms-extensions' as well as
two other extensions.  First, a pointer to a structure is automatically
converted to a pointer to an anonymous field for assignments and
function calls.  For example:

     struct s1 { int a; };
     struct s2 { struct s1; };
     extern void f1 (struct s1 *);
     void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (p); }

In the call to 'f1' inside 'f2', the pointer 'p' is converted into a
pointer to the anonymous field.

 Second, when the type of an anonymous field is a 'typedef' for a
'struct' or 'union', code may refer to the field using the name of the
'typedef'.

     typedef struct { int a; } s1;
     struct s2 { s1; };
     s1 f1 (struct s2 *p) { return p->s1; }

 These usages are only permitted when they are not ambiguous.

6.61 Thread-Local Storage
=========================

Thread-local storage (TLS) is a mechanism by which variables are
allocated such that there is one instance of the variable per extant
thread.  The runtime model GCC uses to implement this originates in the
IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated to other
processors as well.  It requires significant support from the linker
('ld'), dynamic linker ('ld.so'), and system libraries ('libc.so' and
'libpthread.so'), so it is not available everywhere.

 At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage class
keyword: '__thread'.  For example:

     __thread int i;
     extern __thread struct state s;
     static __thread char *p;

 The '__thread' specifier may be used alone, with the 'extern' or
'static' specifiers, but with no other storage class specifier.  When
used with 'extern' or 'static', '__thread' must appear immediately after
the other storage class specifier.

 The '__thread' specifier may be applied to any global, file-scoped
static, function-scoped static, or static data member of a class.  It
may not be applied to block-scoped automatic or non-static data member.

 When the address-of operator is applied to a thread-local variable, it
is evaluated at run time and returns the address of the current thread's
instance of that variable.  An address so obtained may be used by any
thread.  When a thread terminates, any pointers to thread-local
variables in that thread become invalid.

 No static initialization may refer to the address of a thread-local
variable.

 In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it
must be a CONSTANT-EXPRESSION, as defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++
standard.

 See ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage
(http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf) for a detailed explanation of
the four thread-local storage addressing models, and how the runtime is
expected to function.

document the exact semantics of the language extension.

   * '5.1.2 Execution environments'

     Add new text after paragraph 1

          Within either execution environment, a "thread" is a flow of
          control within a program.  It is implementation defined
          whether or not there may be more than one thread associated
          with a program.  It is implementation defined how threads
          beyond the first are created, the name and type of the
          function called at thread startup, and how threads may be
          terminated.  However, objects with thread storage duration
          shall be initialized before thread startup.

   * '6.2.4 Storage durations of objects'

     Add new text before paragraph 3

          An object whose identifier is declared with the storage-class
          specifier '__thread' has "thread storage duration".  Its
          lifetime is the entire execution of the thread, and its stored
          value is initialized only once, prior to thread startup.

   * '6.4.1 Keywords'

     Add '__thread'.

   * '6.7.1 Storage-class specifiers'

     Add '__thread' to the list of storage class specifiers in paragraph
     1.

     Change paragraph 2 to

          With the exception of '__thread', at most one storage-class
          specifier may be given [...].  The '__thread' specifier may be
          used alone, or immediately following 'extern' or 'static'.

     Add new text after paragraph 6

          The declaration of an identifier for a variable that has block
          scope that specifies '__thread' shall also specify either
          'extern' or 'static'.

The following are a set of changes to ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (aka C++98)
that document the exact semantics of the language extension.

   * [intro.execution]

     New text after paragraph 4

          A "thread" is a flow of control within the abstract machine.
          It is implementation defined whether or not there may be more
          than one thread.

     New text after paragraph 7

          It is unspecified whether additional action must be taken to
          ensure when and whether side effects are visible to other
          threads.

   * [lex.key]

     Add '__thread'.

   * [basic.start.main]

     Add after paragraph 5

          The thread that begins execution at the 'main' function is
          called the "main thread".  It is implementation defined how
          functions beginning threads other than the main thread are
          designated or typed.  A function so designated, as well as the
          'main' function, is called a "thread startup function".  It is
          implementation defined what happens if a thread startup
          function returns.  It is implementation defined what happens
          to other threads when any thread calls 'exit'.

   * [basic.start.init]

     Add after paragraph 4

          The storage for an object of thread storage duration shall be
          statically initialized before the first statement of the
          thread startup function.  An object of thread storage duration
          shall not require dynamic initialization.

   * [basic.start.term]

     Add after paragraph 3

          The type of an object with thread storage duration shall not
          have a non-trivial destructor, nor shall it be an array type
          whose elements (directly or indirectly) have non-trivial
          destructors.

     Add "thread storage duration" to the list in paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 2

          Thread, static, and automatic storage durations are associated
          with objects introduced by declarations [...].

     Add '__thread' to the list of specifiers in paragraph 3.

   * [basic.stc.thread]

     New section before [basic.stc.static]

          The keyword '__thread' applied to a non-local object gives the
          object thread storage duration.

          A local variable or class data member declared both 'static'
          and '__thread' gives the variable or member thread storage
          duration.

   * [basic.stc.static]

     Change paragraph 1

          All objects that have neither thread storage duration, dynamic
          storage duration nor are local [...].

   * [dcl.stc]

     Add '__thread' to the list in paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 1

          With the exception of '__thread', at most one

          DECL-SPECIFIER-SEQ.  The '__thread' specifier may be used
          alone, or immediately following the 'extern' or 'static'
          specifiers.  [...]

     Add after paragraph 5

          The '__thread' specifier can be applied only to the names of
          objects and to anonymous unions.

6.62 Binary constants using the '0b' prefix
===========================================

Integer constants can be written as binary constants, consisting of a
sequence of '0' and '1' digits, prefixed by '0b' or '0B'.  This is
particularly useful in environments that operate a lot on the bit level
(like microcontrollers).

 The following statements are identical:

     i =       42;
     i =     0x2a;
     i =      052;
     i = 0b101010;

 The type of these constants follows the same rules as for octal or
hexadecimal integer constants, so suffixes like 'L' or 'UL' can be
applied.

If you want to write code that checks whether these features are
available, you can test for the GNU compiler the same way as for C
programs: check for a predefined macro '__GNUC__'.  You can also use
'__GNUG__' to test specifically for GNU C++ (*note Predefined Macros:
(cpp)Common Predefined Macros.).

7.1 When is a Volatile C++ Object Accessed?
===========================================

The C++ standard differs from the C standard in its treatment of
volatile objects.  It fails to specify what constitutes a volatile
access, except to say that C++ should behave in a similar manner to C
with respect to volatiles, where possible.  However, the different
lvalueness of expressions between C and C++ complicate the behavior.
G++ behaves the same as GCC for volatile access, *Note Volatiles: C
Extensions, for a description of GCC's behavior.

 The C and C++ language specifications differ when an object is accessed
in a void context:

     volatile int *src = SOMEVALUE;
     *src;

 The C++ standard specifies that such expressions do not undergo lvalue
to rvalue conversion, and that the type of the dereferenced object may
be incomplete.  The C++ standard does not specify explicitly that it is
lvalue to rvalue conversion that is responsible for causing an access.
There is reason to believe that it is, because otherwise certain simple
expressions become undefined.  However, because it would surprise most
programmers, G++ treats dereferencing a pointer to volatile object of
complete type as GCC would do for an equivalent type in C.  When the
object has incomplete type, G++ issues a warning; if you wish to force
an error, you must force a conversion to rvalue with, for instance, a
static cast.

 When using a reference to volatile, G++ does not treat equivalent
expressions as accesses to volatiles, but instead issues a warning that
no volatile is accessed.  The rationale for this is that otherwise it
becomes difficult to determine where volatile access occur, and not
possible to ignore the return value from functions returning volatile
references.  Again, if you wish to force a read, cast the reference to
an rvalue.

 G++ implements the same behavior as GCC does when assigning to a
volatile object--there is no reread of the assigned-to object, the
assigned rvalue is reused.  Note that in C++ assignment expressions are
lvalues, and if used as an lvalue, the volatile object is referred to.
For instance, VREF refers to VOBJ, as expected, in the following
example:

     volatile int vobj;
     volatile int &vref = vobj = SOMETHING;


File: gcc.info,  Node: Restricted Pointers,  Next: Vague Linkage,  Prev: C++ Volatiles,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.2 Restricting Pointer Aliasing
================================

As with the C front end, G++ understands the C99 feature of restricted
pointers, specified with the '__restrict__', or '__restrict' type
qualifier.  Because you cannot compile C++ by specifying the '-std=c99'
language flag, 'restrict' is not a keyword in C++.

 In addition to allowing restricted pointers, you can specify restricted
references, which indicate that the reference is not aliased in the
local context.

     void fn (int *__restrict__ rptr, int &__restrict__ rref)
     {
       /* ... */
     }

In the body of 'fn', RPTR points to an unaliased integer and RREF refers
to a (different) unaliased integer.

 You may also specify whether a member function's THIS pointer is
unaliased by using '__restrict__' as a member function qualifier.

     void T::fn () __restrict__
     {
       /* ... */
     }

Within the body of 'T::fn', THIS has the effective definition 'T
*__restrict__ const this'.  Notice that the interpretation of a
'__restrict__' member function qualifier is different to that of 'const'
or 'volatile' qualifier, in that it is applied to the pointer rather
than the object.  This is consistent with other compilers that implement
restricted pointers.

 As with all outermost parameter qualifiers, '__restrict__' is ignored
in function definition matching.  This means you only need to specify
'__restrict__' in a function definition, rather than in a function
prototype as well.

7.3 Vague Linkage
=================

There are several constructs in C++ that require space in the object
file but are not clearly tied to a single translation unit.  We say that
these constructs have "vague linkage".  Typically such constructs are
emitted wherever they are needed, though sometimes we can be more
clever.

Inline Functions
     Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can
     be included in many different compilations.  Hopefully they can
     usually be inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is necessary,
     if the address of the function is taken or if inlining fails.  In
     general, we emit an out-of-line copy in all translation units where
     one is needed.  As an exception, we only emit inline virtual
     functions with the vtable, since it always requires a copy.

     Local static variables and string constants used in an inline
     function are also considered to have vague linkage, since they must
     be shared between all inlined and out-of-line instances of the
     function.

VTables
     C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a
     lookup table, known as a vtable.  The vtable contains pointers to
     the virtual functions provided by a class, and each object of the
     class contains a pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some
     multiple-inheritance situations).  If the class declares any
     non-inline, non-pure virtual functions, the first one is chosen as
     the "key method" for the class, and the vtable is only emitted in
     the translation unit where the key method is defined.

     _Note:_ If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the
     vtable is still emitted in every translation unit that defines it.
     Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class
     body, even if they are not defined there.

'type_info' objects
     C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to
     implement 'dynamic_cast', 'typeid' and exception handling.  For
     polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the
     'type_info' object is written out along with the vtable so that
     'dynamic_cast' can determine the dynamic type of a class object at
     run time.  For all other types, we write out the 'type_info' object
     when it is used: when applying 'typeid' to an expression, throwing
     an object, or referring to a type in a catch clause or exception
     specification.

Template Instantiations
     Most everything in this section also applies to template
     instantiations, but there are other options as well.  *Note Where's
     the Template?: Template Instantiation.

 When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, duplicate copies of
these constructs will be discarded at link time.  This is known as
COMDAT support.

 On targets that don't support COMDAT, but do support weak symbols, GCC
uses them.  This way one copy overrides all the others, but the unused
copies still take up space in the executable.

 For targets that do not support either COMDAT or weak symbols, most
entities with vague linkage are emitted as local symbols to avoid
duplicate definition errors from the linker.  This does not happen for
local statics in inlines, however, as having multiple copies almost
certainly breaks things.

 *Note Declarations and Definitions in One Header: C++ Interface, for
another way to control placement of these constructs.


File: gcc.info,  Node: C++ Interface,  Next: Template Instantiation,  Prev: Vague Linkage,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.4 #pragma interface and implementation
========================================

'#pragma interface' and '#pragma implementation' provide the user with a
way of explicitly directing the compiler to emit entities with vague
linkage (and debugging information) in a particular translation unit.

 _Note:_ As of GCC 2.7.2, these '#pragma's are not useful in most cases,
because of COMDAT support and the "key method" heuristic mentioned in
*note Vague Linkage::.  Using them can actually cause your program to
grow due to unnecessary out-of-line copies of inline functions.
Currently (3.4) the only benefit of these '#pragma's is reduced
duplication of debugging information, and that should be addressed soon
on DWARF 2 targets with the use of COMDAT groups.

'#pragma interface'
'#pragma interface "SUBDIR/OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this directive in _header files_ that define object classes, to
     save space in most of the object files that use those classes.
     Normally, local copies of certain information (backup copies of
     inline member functions, debugging information, and the internal
     tables that implement virtual functions) must be kept in each
     object file that includes class definitions.  You can use this
     pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a header file containing
     '#pragma interface' is included in a compilation, this auxiliary
     information is not generated (unless the main input source file
     itself uses '#pragma implementation').  Instead, the object files
     contain references to be resolved at link time.

     The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you
     have multiple headers with the same name in different directories.
     If you use this form, you must specify the same string to '#pragma
     implementation'.

'#pragma implementation'
'#pragma implementation "OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this pragma in a _main input file_, when you want full output
     from included header files to be generated (and made globally
     visible).  The included header file, in turn, should use '#pragma
     interface'.  Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging
     information, and the internal tables used to implement virtual
     functions are all generated in implementation files.

     If you use '#pragma implementation' with no argument, it applies to
     an include file with the same basename(1) as your source file.  For
     example, in 'allclass.cc', giving just '#pragma implementation' by
     itself is equivalent to '#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'.

     In versions of GNU C++ prior to 2.6.0 'allclass.h' was treated as
     an implementation file whenever you would include it from
     'allclass.cc' even if you never specified '#pragma implementation'.
     This was deemed to be more trouble than it was worth, however, and
     disabled.

     Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
     include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
     '#include' to include the header file; '#pragma implementation'
     only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually include
     it.)

     There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file
     into multiple implementation files.

 '#pragma implementation' and '#pragma interface' also have an effect on
function inlining.

 If you define a class in a header file marked with '#pragma interface',
the effect on an inline function defined in that class is similar to an
explicit 'extern' declaration--the compiler emits no code at all to
define an independent version of the function.  Its definition is used
only for inlining with its callers.

 Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as '#pragma implementation', the compiler emits code
for the function itself; this defines a version of the function that can
be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without inlining).  If all
calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid emitting the
function by compiling with '-fno-implement-inlines'.  If any calls are
not inlined, you will get linker errors.

7.5 Where's the Template?
=========================

C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which are referred to as the Borland model and the Cfront
model.

Borland model
     Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the
     code equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler
     emits template instances in each translation unit that uses them,
     and the linker collapses them together.  The advantage of this
     model is that the linker only has to consider the object files
     themselves; there is no external complexity to worry about.  This
     disadvantage is that compilation time is increased because the
     template code is being compiled repeatedly.  Code written for this
     model tends to include definitions of all templates in the header
     file, since they must be seen to be instantiated.

Cfront model
     The AT&T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
     problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
     automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.
     A more modern version of the repository works as follows: As
     individual object files are built, the compiler places any template
     definitions and instantiations encountered in the repository.  At
     link time, the link wrapper adds in the objects in the repository
     and compiles any needed instances that were not previously emitted.
     The advantages of this model are more optimal compilation speed and
     the ability to use the system linker; to implement the Borland
     model a compiler vendor also needs to replace the linker.  The
     disadvantages are vastly increased complexity, and thus potential
     for error; for some code this can be just as transparent, but in
     practice it can been very difficult to build multiple programs in
     one directory and one program in multiple directories.  Code
     written for this model tends to separate definitions of non-inline
     member templates into a separate file, which should be compiled
     separately.

 When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, G++ supports the
Borland model.  On other systems, G++ implements neither automatic
model.

 You have the following options for dealing with template
instantiations:

  1. Compile your template-using code with '-frepo'.  The compiler
     generates files with the extension '.rpo' listing all of the
     template instantiations used in the corresponding object files that
     could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, 'collect2', then
     updates the '.rpo' files to tell the compiler where to place those
     instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
     link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the
     compiler continues to place the instantiations in the same files.

     This is your best option for application code written for the
     Borland model, as it just works.  Code written for the Cfront model
     needs to be modified so that the template definitions are available
     at one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple
     as adding '#include <tmethods.cc>' to the end of each template
     header.

     For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the
     template instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its
     object files together; the link will fail, but cause the
     instantiations to be generated as a side effect.  Be warned,
     however, that this may cause conflicts if multiple libraries try to
     provide the same instantiations.  For greater control, use explicit
     instantiation as described in the next option.

  2. Compile your code with '-fno-implicit-templates' to disable the
     implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly
     instantiate all the ones you use.  This approach requires more
     knowledge of exactly which instances you need than do the others,
     but it's less mysterious and allows greater control.  You can
     scatter the explicit instantiations throughout your program,
     perhaps putting them in the translation units where the instances
     are used or the translation units that define the templates
     themselves; you can put all of the explicit instantiations you need
     into one big file; or you can create small files like

          #include "Foo.h"
          #include "Foo.cc"

          template class Foo<int>;
          template ostream& operator <<
                          (ostream&, const Foo<int>&);

     for each of the instances you need, and create a template
     instantiation library from those.

     If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with
     not using '-fno-implicit-templates' when compiling files that don't
     '#include' the member template definitions.

     If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
     compile it without '-fno-implicit-templates' so you get all of the
     instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
     other files) without having to specify them as well.

     The ISO C++ 2011 standard allows forward declaration of explicit
     instantiations (with 'extern').  G++ supports explicit
     instantiation declarations in C++98 mode and has extended the
     template instantiation syntax to support instantiation of the
     compiler support data for a template class (i.e. the vtable)
     without instantiating any of its members (with 'inline'), and
     instantiation of only the static data members of a template class,
     without the support data or member functions (with ('static'):

          extern template int max (int, int);
          inline template class Foo<int>;
          static template class Foo<int>;

  3. Do nothing.  Pretend G++ does implement automatic instantiation
     management.  Code written for the Borland model works fine, but
     each translation unit contains instances of each of the templates
     it uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable
     amount of code duplication.

7.6 Extracting the function pointer from a bound pointer to member function
===========================================================================

In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the 'this' pointer, and
if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.

 Note that you still pay the penalty for the call through a function
pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the branch
prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal virtual
function calls.

 The syntax for this extension is

     extern A a;
     extern int (A::*fp)();
     typedef int (*fptr)(A *);

     fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);

 For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form '&Klasse::Member'), no
object is needed to obtain the address of the function.  They can be
converted to function pointers directly:

     fptr p1 = (fptr)(&A::foo);

 You must specify '-Wno-pmf-conversions' to use this extension.

7.7 C++-Specific Variable, Function, and Type Attributes
========================================================

Some attributes only make sense for C++ programs.

'abi_tag ("TAG", ...)'
     The 'abi_tag' attribute can be applied to a function or class
     declaration.  It modifies the mangled name of the function or class
     to incorporate the tag name, in order to distinguish the function
     or class from an earlier version with a different ABI; perhaps the
     class has changed size, or the function has a different return type
     that is not encoded in the mangled name.

     The argument can be a list of strings of arbitrary length.  The
     strings are sorted on output, so the order of the list is
     unimportant.

     A redeclaration of a function or class must not add new ABI tags,
     since doing so would change the mangled name.

     The ABI tags apply to a name, so all instantiations and
     specializations of a template have the same tags.  The attribute
     will be ignored if applied to an explicit specialization or
     instantiation.

     The '-Wabi-tag' flag enables a warning about a class which does not
     have all the ABI tags used by its subobjects and virtual functions;
     for users with code that needs to coexist with an earlier ABI,
     using this option can help to find all affected types that need to
     be tagged.

'init_priority (PRIORITY)'

     In Standard C++, objects defined at namespace scope are guaranteed
     to be initialized in an order in strict accordance with that of
     their definitions _in a given translation unit_.  No guarantee is
     made for initializations across translation units.  However, GNU
     C++ allows users to control the order of initialization of objects
     defined at namespace scope with the 'init_priority' attribute by
     specifying a relative PRIORITY, a constant integral expression
     currently bounded between 101 and 65535 inclusive.  Lower numbers
     indicate a higher priority.

     In the following example, 'A' would normally be created before 'B',
     but the 'init_priority' attribute reverses that order:

          Some_Class  A  __attribute__ ((init_priority (2000)));
          Some_Class  B  __attribute__ ((init_priority (543)));

     Note that the particular values of PRIORITY do not matter; only
     their relative ordering.

'java_interface'

     This type attribute informs C++ that the class is a Java interface.
     It may only be applied to classes declared within an 'extern
     "Java"' block.  Calls to methods declared in this interface are
     dispatched using GCJ's interface table mechanism, instead of
     regular virtual table dispatch.

'warn_unused'

     For C++ types with non-trivial constructors and/or destructors it
     is impossible for the compiler to determine whether a variable of
     this type is truly unused if it is not referenced.  This type
     attribute informs the compiler that variables of this type should
     be warned about if they appear to be unused, just like variables of
     fundamental types.

     This attribute is appropriate for types which just represent a
     value, such as 'std::string'; it is not appropriate for types which
     control a resource, such as 'std::mutex'.

     This attribute is also accepted in C, but it is unnecessary because
     C does not have constructors or destructors.

7.8 Function Multiversioning
============================

With the GNU C++ front end, for target i386, you may specify multiple
versions of a function, where each function is specialized for a
specific target feature.  At runtime, the appropriate version of the
function is automatically executed depending on the characteristics of
the execution platform.  Here is an example.

     __attribute__ ((target ("default")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // The default version of foo.
       return 0;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("sse4.2")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for SSE4.2
       return 1;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=atom")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the Intel ATOM processor
       return 2;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=amdfam10")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the AMD Family 0x10 processors.
       return 3;
     }

     int main ()
     {
       int (*p)() = &foo;
       assert ((*p) () == foo ());
       return 0;
     }

 In the above example, four versions of function foo are created.  The
first version of foo with the target attribute "default" is the default
version.  This version gets executed when no other target specific
version qualifies for execution on a particular platform.  A new version
of foo is created by using the same function signature but with a
different target string.  Function foo is called or a pointer to it is
taken just like a regular function.  GCC takes care of doing the
dispatching to call the right version at runtime.  Refer to the GCC wiki
on Function Multiversioning
(http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FunctionMultiVersioning) for more details.

7.9 Namespace Association
=========================

*Caution:* The semantics of this extension are equivalent to C++ 2011
inline namespaces.  Users should use inline namespaces instead as this
extension will be removed in future versions of G++.

 A using-directive with '__attribute ((strong))' is stronger than a
normal using-directive in two ways:

   * Templates from the used namespace can be specialized and explicitly
     instantiated as though they were members of the using namespace.

   * The using namespace is considered an associated namespace of all
     templates in the used namespace for purposes of argument-dependent
     name lookup.

 The used namespace must be nested within the using namespace so that
normal unqualified lookup works properly.

 This is useful for composing a namespace transparently from
implementation namespaces.  For example:

     namespace std {
       namespace debug {
         template <class T> struct A { };
       }
       using namespace debug __attribute ((__strong__));
       template <> struct A<int> { };   // OK to specialize

       template <class T> void f (A<T>);
     }

     int main()
     {
       f (std::A<float>());             // lookup finds std::f
       f (std::A<int>());
     }

7.11 Java Exceptions
====================

The Java language uses a slightly different exception handling model
from C++.  Normally, GNU C++ automatically detects when you are writing
C++ code that uses Java exceptions, and handle them appropriately.
However, if C++ code only needs to execute destructors when Java
exceptions are thrown through it, GCC guesses incorrectly.  Sample
problematic code is:

       struct S { ~S(); };
       extern void bar();    // is written in Java, and may throw exceptions
       void foo()
       {
         S s;
         bar();
       }

The usual effect of an incorrect guess is a link failure, complaining of
a missing routine called '__gxx_personality_v0'.

 You can inform the compiler that Java exceptions are to be used in a
translation unit, irrespective of what it might think, by writing
'#pragma GCC java_exceptions' at the head of the file.  This '#pragma'
must appear before any functions that throw or catch exceptions, or run
destructors when exceptions are thrown through them.

 You cannot mix Java and C++ exceptions in the same translation unit.
It is believed to be safe to throw a C++ exception from one file through
another file compiled for the Java exception model, or vice versa, but
there may be bugs in this area.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Deprecated Features,  Next: Backwards Compatibility,  Prev: Java Exceptions,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.12 Deprecated Features
========================

In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving.  Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superseded by
superior alternatives.  Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future.  In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.

 While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the
options that are now deprecated:

'-fexternal-templates'
'-falt-external-templates'
     These are two of the many ways for G++ to implement template
     instantiation.  *Note Template Instantiation::.  The C++ standard
     clearly defines how template definitions have to be organized
     across implementation units.  G++ has an implicit instantiation
     mechanism that should work just fine for standard-conforming code.

'-fstrict-prototype'
'-fno-strict-prototype'
     Previously it was possible to use an empty prototype parameter list
     to indicate an unspecified number of parameters (like C), rather
     than no parameters, as C++ demands.  This feature has been removed,
     except where it is required for backwards compatibility.  *Note
     Backwards Compatibility::.

 G++ allows a virtual function returning 'void *' to be overridden by
one returning a different pointer type.  This extension to the covariant
return type rules is now deprecated and will be removed from a future
version.

 The G++ minimum and maximum operators ('<?' and '>?') and their
compound forms ('<?=') and '>?=') have been deprecated and are now
removed from G++.  Code using these operators should be modified to use
'std::min' and 'std::max' instead.

 The named return value extension has been deprecated, and is now
removed from G++.

 The use of initializer lists with new expressions has been deprecated,
and is now removed from G++.

 Floating and complex non-type template parameters have been deprecated,
and are now removed from G++.

 The implicit typename extension has been deprecated and is now removed
from G++.

 The use of default arguments in function pointers, function typedefs
and other places where they are not permitted by the standard is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version of G++.

 G++ allows floating-point literals to appear in integral constant
expressions, e.g. ' enum E { e = int(2.2 * 3.7) } ' This extension is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version.

 G++ allows static data members of const floating-point type to be
declared with an initializer in a class definition.  The standard only
allows initializers for static members of const integral types and const
enumeration types so this extension has been deprecated and will be
removed from a future version.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Backwards Compatibility,  Prev: Deprecated Features,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.13 Backwards Compatibility
============================

Now that there is a definitive ISO standard C++, G++ has a specification
to adhere to.  The C++ language evolved over time, and features that
used to be acceptable in previous drafts of the standard, such as the
ARM [Annotated C++ Reference Manual], are no longer accepted.  In order
to allow compilation of C++ written to such drafts, G++ contains some
backwards compatibilities.  _All such backwards compatibility features
are liable to disappear in future versions of G++._  They should be
considered deprecated.  *Note Deprecated Features::.

'For scope'
     If a variable is declared at for scope, it used to remain in scope
     until the end of the scope that contained the for statement (rather
     than just within the for scope).  G++ retains this, but issues a
     warning, if such a variable is accessed outside the for scope.

'Implicit C language'
     Old C system header files did not contain an 'extern "C" {...}'
     scope to set the language.  On such systems, all header files are
     implicitly scoped inside a C language scope.  Also, an empty
     prototype '()' is treated as an unspecified number of arguments,
     rather than no arguments, as C++ demands.

8.1 GNU Objective-C runtime API
===============================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API that allows you to interact
with the Objective-C runtime system, querying the live runtime
structures and even manipulating them.  This allows you for example to
inspect and navigate classes, methods and protocols; to define new
classes or new methods, and even to modify existing classes or
protocols.

 If you are using a "Foundation" library such as GNUstep-Base, this
library will provide you with a rich set of functionality to do most of
the inspection tasks, and you probably will only need direct access to
the GNU Objective-C runtime API to define new classes or methods.

* Modern GNU Objective-C runtime API::
* Traditional GNU Objective-C runtime API::

8.1.1 Modern GNU Objective-C runtime API
----------------------------------------

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API which is similar to the one
provided by the "Objective-C 2.0" Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime.  The
API is documented in the public header files of the GNU Objective-C
runtime:

   * 'objc/objc.h': this is the basic Objective-C header file, defining
     the basic Objective-C types such as 'id', 'Class' and 'BOOL'.  You
     have to include this header to do almost anything with Objective-C.

   * 'objc/runtime.h': this header declares most of the public runtime
     API functions allowing you to inspect and manipulate the
     Objective-C runtime data structures.  These functions are fairly
     standardized across Objective-C runtimes and are almost identical
     to the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime ones.  It does not declare
     functions in some specialized areas (constructing and forwarding
     message invocations, threading) which are in the other headers
     below.  You have to include 'objc/objc.h' and 'objc/runtime.h' to
     use any of the functions, such as 'class_getName()', declared in
     'objc/runtime.h'.

   * 'objc/message.h': this header declares public functions used to
     construct, deconstruct and forward message invocations.  Because
     messaging is done in quite a different way on different runtimes,
     functions in this header are specific to the GNU Objective-C
     runtime implementation.

   * 'objc/objc-exception.h': this header declares some public functions
     related to Objective-C exceptions.  For example functions in this
     header allow you to throw an Objective-C exception from plain C/C++
     code.

   * 'objc/objc-sync.h': this header declares some public functions
     related to the Objective-C '@synchronized()' syntax, allowing you
     to emulate an Objective-C '@synchronized()' block in plain C/C++
     code.

   * 'objc/thr.h': this header declares a public runtime API threading
     layer that is only provided by the GNU Objective-C runtime.  It
     declares functions such as 'objc_mutex_lock()', which provide a
     platform-independent set of threading functions.

 The header files contain detailed documentation for each function in
the GNU Objective-C runtime API.

8.1.2 Traditional GNU Objective-C runtime API
---------------------------------------------

The GNU Objective-C runtime used to provide a different API, which we
call the "traditional" GNU Objective-C runtime API. Functions belonging
to this API are easy to recognize because they use a different naming
convention, such as 'class_get_super_class()' (traditional API) instead
of 'class_getSuperclass()' (modern API). Software using this API
includes the file 'objc/objc-api.h' where it is declared.

 Starting with GCC 4.7.0, the traditional GNU runtime API is no longer
available.

8.2 '+load': Executing code before main
=======================================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a way that allows you to execute
code before the execution of the program enters the 'main' function.
The code is executed on a per-class and a per-category basis, through a
special class method '+load'.

 This facility is very useful if you want to initialize global variables
which can be accessed by the program directly, without sending a message
to the class first.  The usual way to initialize global variables, in
the '+initialize' method, might not be useful because '+initialize' is
only called when the first message is sent to a class object, which in
some cases could be too late.

 Suppose for example you have a 'FileStream' class that declares
'Stdin', 'Stdout' and 'Stderr' as global variables, like below:


     FileStream *Stdin = nil;
     FileStream *Stdout = nil;
     FileStream *Stderr = nil;

     @implementation FileStream

     + (void)initialize
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }

     /* Other methods here */
     @end


 In this example, the initialization of 'Stdin', 'Stdout' and 'Stderr'
in '+initialize' occurs too late.  The programmer can send a message to
one of these objects before the variables are actually initialized, thus
sending messages to the 'nil' object.  The '+initialize' method which
actually initializes the global variables is not invoked until the first
message is sent to the class object.  The solution would require these
variables to be initialized just before entering 'main'.

 The correct solution of the above problem is to use the '+load' method
instead of '+initialize':


     @implementation FileStream

     + (void)load
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }

     /* Other methods here */
     @end


 The '+load' is a method that is not overridden by categories.  If a
class and a category of it both implement '+load', both methods are
invoked.  This allows some additional initializations to be performed in
a category.

 This mechanism is not intended to be a replacement for '+initialize'.
You should be aware of its limitations when you decide to use it instead
of '+initialize'.

* Menu:

* What you can and what you cannot do in +load::


File: gcc.info,  Node: What you can and what you cannot do in +load,  Up: Executing code before main

8.2.1 What you can and what you cannot do in '+load'
----------------------------------------------------

'+load' is to be used only as a last resort.  Because it is executed
very early, most of the Objective-C runtime machinery will not be ready
when '+load' is executed; hence '+load' works best for executing C code
that is independent on the Objective-C runtime.

 The '+load' implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the
following things:

   * you can write whatever C code you like;

   * you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is
     implemented in the same file;

   * the '+load' implementation of all super classes of a class are
     executed before the '+load' of that class is executed;

   * the '+load' implementation of a class is executed before the
     '+load' implementation of any category.

 In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:

   * allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;

   * allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
     category implemented in the same file;

   * sending messages to Objective-C constant strings ('@"this is a
     constant string"');

 You should make no assumptions about receiving '+load' in sibling
classes when you write '+load' of a class.  The order in which sibling
classes receive '+load' is not guaranteed.

 The order in which '+load' and '+initialize' are called could be
problematic if this matters.  If you don't allocate objects inside
'+load', it is guaranteed that '+load' is called before '+initialize'.
If you create an object inside '+load' the '+initialize' method of
object's class is invoked even if '+load' was not invoked.  Note if you
explicitly call '+load' on a class, '+initialize' will be called first.
To avoid possible problems try to implement only one of these methods.

 The '+load' method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically loaded
into your running program.  This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you.  When you write bundles and you need to
write '+load' you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program.  The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.

8.3 Type encoding
=================

This is an advanced section.  Type encodings are used extensively by the
compiler and by the runtime, but you generally do not need to know about
them to use Objective-C.

 The Objective-C compiler generates type encodings for all the types.
These type encodings are used at runtime to find out information about
selectors and methods and about objects and classes.

 The types are encoded in the following way:

'_Bool'            'B'
'char'             'c'
'unsigned char'    'C'
'short'            's'
'unsigned short'   'S'
'int'              'i'
'unsigned int'     'I'
'long'             'l'
'unsigned long'    'L'
'long long'        'q'
'unsigned long     'Q'
long'
'float'            'f'
'double'           'd'
'long double'      'D'
'void'             'v'
'id'               '@'
'Class'            '#'
'SEL'              ':'
'char*'            '*'
'enum'             an 'enum' is encoded exactly as the integer type
                   that the compiler uses for it, which depends on the
                   enumeration values.  Often the compiler users
                   'unsigned int', which is then encoded as 'I'.
unknown type       '?'
Complex types      'j' followed by the inner type.  For example
                   '_Complex double' is encoded as "jd".
bit-fields         'b' followed by the starting position of the
                   bit-field, the type of the bit-field and the size of
                   the bit-field (the bit-fields encoding was changed
                   from the NeXT's compiler encoding, see below)

 The encoding of bit-fields has changed to allow bit-fields to be
properly handled by the runtime functions that compute sizes and
alignments of types that contain bit-fields.  The previous encoding
contained only the size of the bit-field.  Using only this information
it is not possible to reliably compute the size occupied by the
bit-field.  This is very important in the presence of the Boehm's
garbage collector because the objects are allocated using the typed
memory facility available in this collector.  The typed memory
allocation requires information about where the pointers are located
inside the object.

 The position in the bit-field is the position, counting in bits, of the
bit closest to the beginning of the structure.

 The non-atomic types are encoded as follows:

pointers       '^' followed by the pointed type.
arrays         '[' followed by the number of elements in the array
               followed by the type of the elements followed by ']'
structures     '{' followed by the name of the structure (or '?' if the
               structure is unnamed), the '=' sign, the type of the
               members and by '}'
unions         '(' followed by the name of the structure (or '?' if the
               union is unnamed), the '=' sign, the type of the members
               followed by ')'
vectors        '![' followed by the vector_size (the number of bytes
               composing the vector) followed by a comma, followed by
               the alignment (in bytes) of the vector, followed by the
               type of the elements followed by ']'

 Here are some types and their encodings, as they are generated by the
compiler on an i386 machine:


Objective-C type   Compiler encoding
     int a[10];    '[10i]'
     struct {      '{?=i[3f]b128i3b131i2c}'
       int i;
       float f[3];
       int a:3;
       int b:2;
       char c;
     }
     int a __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));'![16,16i]' (alignment would depend on the machine)


 In addition to the types the compiler also encodes the type specifiers.
The table below describes the encoding of the current Objective-C type
specifiers:


Specifier          Encoding
'const'            'r'
'in'               'n'
'inout'            'N'
'out'              'o'
'bycopy'           'O'
'byref'            'R'
'oneway'           'V'


 The type specifiers are encoded just before the type.  Unlike types
however, the type specifiers are only encoded when they appear in method
argument types.

 Note how 'const' interacts with pointers:


Objective-C type   Compiler encoding
     const int     'ri'
     const int*    '^ri'
     int *const    'r^i'


 'const int*' is a pointer to a 'const int', and so is encoded as '^ri'.
'int* const', instead, is a 'const' pointer to an 'int', and so is
encoded as 'r^i'.

 Finally, there is a complication when encoding 'const char *' versus
'char * const'.  Because 'char *' is encoded as '*' and not as '^c',
there is no way to express the fact that 'r' applies to the pointer or
to the pointee.

 Hence, it is assumed as a convention that 'r*' means 'const char *'
(since it is what is most often meant), and there is no way to encode
'char *const'.  'char *const' would simply be encoded as '*', and the
'const' is lost.

8.3.1 Legacy type encoding
--------------------------

Unfortunately, historically GCC used to have a number of bugs in its
encoding code.  The NeXT runtime expects GCC to emit type encodings in
this historical format (compatible with GCC-3.3), so when using the NeXT
runtime, GCC will introduce on purpose a number of incorrect encodings:

   * the read-only qualifier of the pointee gets emitted before the '^'.
     The read-only qualifier of the pointer itself gets ignored, unless
     it is a typedef.  Also, the 'r' is only emitted for the outermost
     type.

   * 32-bit longs are encoded as 'l' or 'L', but not always.  For
     typedefs, the compiler uses 'i' or 'I' instead if encoding a struct
     field or a pointer.

   * 'enum's are always encoded as 'i' (int) even if they are actually
     unsigned or long.

 In addition to that, the NeXT runtime uses a different encoding for
bitfields.  It encodes them as 'b' followed by the size, without a bit
offset or the underlying field type.


File: gcc.info,  Node: @encode,  Next: Method signatures,  Prev: Legacy type encoding,  Up: Type encoding

8.3.2 @encode
-------------

GNU Objective-C supports the '@encode' syntax that allows you to create
a type encoding from a C/Objective-C type.  For example, '@encode(int)'
is compiled by the compiler into '"i"'.

 '@encode' does not support type qualifiers other than 'const'.  For
example, '@encode(const char*)' is valid and is compiled into '"r*"',
while '@encode(bycopy char *)' is invalid and will cause a compilation
error.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Method signatures,  Prev: @encode,  Up: Type encoding

8.3.3 Method signatures
-----------------------

This section documents the encoding of method types, which is rarely
needed to use Objective-C. You should skip it at a first reading; the
runtime provides functions that will work on methods and can walk
through the list of parameters and interpret them for you.  These
functions are part of the public "API" and are the preferred way to
interact with method signatures from user code.

 But if you need to debug a problem with method signatures and need to
know how they are implemented (i.e., the "ABI"), read on.

 Methods have their "signature" encoded and made available to the
runtime.  The "signature" encodes all the information required to
dynamically build invocations of the method at runtime: return type and
arguments.

 The "signature" is a null-terminated string, composed of the following:

   * The return type, including type qualifiers.  For example, a method
     returning 'int' would have 'i' here.

   * The total size (in bytes) required to pass all the parameters.
     This includes the two hidden parameters (the object 'self' and the
     method selector '_cmd').

   * Each argument, with the type encoding, followed by the offset (in
     bytes) of the argument in the list of parameters.

 For example, a method with no arguments and returning 'int' would have
the signature 'i8@0:4' if the size of a pointer is 4.  The signature is
interpreted as follows: the 'i' is the return type (an 'int'), the '8'
is the total size of the parameters in bytes (two pointers each of size
4), the '@0' is the first parameter (an object at byte offset '0') and
':4' is the second parameter (a 'SEL' at byte offset '4').

 You can easily find more examples by running the "strings" program on
an Objective-C object file compiled by GCC. You'll see a lot of strings
that look very much like 'i8@0:4'.  They are signatures of Objective-C
methods.

8.4 Garbage Collection
======================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 Support for garbage collection with the GNU runtime has been added by
using a powerful conservative garbage collector, known as the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.

 To enable the support for it you have to configure the compiler using
an additional argument, '--enable-objc-gc'.  This will build the
boehm-gc library, and build an additional runtime library which has
several enhancements to support the garbage collector.  The new library
has a new name, 'libobjc_gc.a' to not conflict with the
non-garbage-collected library.

 When the garbage collector is used, the objects are allocated using the
so-called typed memory allocation mechanism available in the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector.  This mode requires precise information
on where pointers are located inside objects.  This information is
computed once per class, immediately after the class has been
initialized.

 There is a new runtime function 'class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()' which
can be used to declare a so-called "weak pointer" reference.  Such a
pointer is basically hidden for the garbage collector; this can be
useful in certain situations, especially when you want to keep track of
the allocated objects, yet allow them to be collected.  This kind of
pointers can only be members of objects, you cannot declare a global
pointer as a weak reference.  Every type which is a pointer type can be
declared a weak pointer, including 'id', 'Class' and 'SEL'.

 Here is an example of how to use this feature.  Suppose you want to
implement a class whose instances hold a weak pointer reference; the
following class does this:


     @interface WeakPointer : Object
     {
         const void* weakPointer;
     }

     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p;
     - (const void*)weakPointer;
     @end


     @implementation WeakPointer

     + (void)initialize
     {
       if (self == objc_lookUpClass ("WeakPointer"))
         class_ivar_set_gcinvisible (self, "weakPointer", YES);
     }

     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p
     {
       weakPointer = p;
       return self;
     }

     - (const void*)weakPointer
     {
       return weakPointer;
     }

     @end


 Weak pointers are supported through a new type character specifier
represented by the '!' character.  The 'class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()'
function adds or removes this specifier to the string type description
of the instance variable named as argument.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Constant string objects,  Next: compatibility_alias,  Prev: Garbage Collection,  Up: Objective-C

8.5 Constant string objects
===========================

GNU Objective-C provides constant string objects that are generated
directly by the compiler.  You declare a constant string object by
prefixing a C constant string with the character '@':

       id myString = @"this is a constant string object";

 The constant string objects are by default instances of the
'NXConstantString' class which is provided by the GNU Objective-C
runtime.  To get the definition of this class you must include the
'objc/NXConstStr.h' header file.

 User defined libraries may want to implement their own constant string
class.  To be able to support them, the GNU Objective-C compiler
provides a new command line options
'-fconstant-string-class=CLASS-NAME'.  The provided class should adhere
to a strict structure, the same as 'NXConstantString''s structure:


     @interface MyConstantStringClass
     {
       Class isa;
       char *c_string;
       unsigned int len;
     }
     @end


 'NXConstantString' inherits from 'Object'; user class libraries may
choose to inherit the customized constant string class from a different
class than 'Object'.  There is no requirement in the methods the
constant string class has to implement, but the final ivar layout of the
class must be the compatible with the given structure.

 When the compiler creates the statically allocated constant string
object, the 'c_string' field will be filled by the compiler with the
string; the 'length' field will be filled by the compiler with the
string length; the 'isa' pointer will be filled with 'NULL' by the
compiler, and it will later be fixed up automatically at runtime by the
GNU Objective-C runtime library to point to the class which was set by
the '-fconstant-string-class' option when the object file is loaded (if
you wonder how it works behind the scenes, the name of the class to use,
and the list of static objects to fixup, are stored by the compiler in
the object file in a place where the GNU runtime library will find them
at runtime).

 As a result, when a file is compiled with the '-fconstant-string-class'
option, all the constant string objects will be instances of the class
specified as argument to this option.  It is possible to have multiple
compilation units referring to different constant string classes,
neither the compiler nor the linker impose any restrictions in doing
this.


File: gcc.info,  Node: compatibility_alias,  Next: Exceptions,  Prev: Constant string objects,  Up: Objective-C

8.6 compatibility_alias
=======================

The keyword '@compatibility_alias' allows you to define a class name as
equivalent to another class name.  For example:

     @compatibility_alias WOApplication GSWApplication;

 tells the compiler that each time it encounters 'WOApplication' as a
class name, it should replace it with 'GSWApplication' (that is,
'WOApplication' is just an alias for 'GSWApplication').

 There are some constraints on how this can be used--

   * 'WOApplication' (the alias) must not be an existing class;

   * 'GSWApplication' (the real class) must be an existing class.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Exceptions,  Next: Synchronization,  Prev: compatibility_alias,  Up: Objective-C

8.7 Exceptions
==============

GNU Objective-C provides exception support built into the language, as
in the following example:

       @try {
         ...
            @throw expr;
         ...
       }
       @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
         ...
           @throw expr;
         ...
           @throw;
         ...
       }
       @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
         ...
       }
       @catch (id allOthers) {
         ...
       }
       @finally {
         ...
           @throw expr;
         ...
       }

 The '@throw' statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a '@catch' block, the
'@throw' may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the '@catch' will be rethrown.

 Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest '@catch' clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how 'catch' blocks work in C++ and Java.  A '@catch(id
...)' clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch any and all
Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous '@catch' clauses (if any).

 The '@finally' clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding '@try ... @catch' section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the '@try ... @catch' section, analogously to the behavior of the
'finally' clause in Java.

 There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

   * The '-fobjc-exceptions' command line option must be used when
     compiling Objective-C files that use exceptions.

   * With the GNU runtime, exceptions are always implemented as "native"
     exceptions and it is recommended that the '-fexceptions' and
     '-shared-libgcc' options are used when linking.

   * With the NeXT runtime, although currently designed to be binary
     compatible with 'NS_HANDLER'-style idioms provided by the
     'NSException' class, the new exceptions can only be used on Mac OS
     X 10.3 (Panther) and later systems, due to additional functionality
     needed in the NeXT Objective-C runtime.

   * As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
     types other than Objective-C objects.  Furthermore, when used from
     Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does not
     interoperate with C++ exceptions at this time.  This means you
     cannot '@throw' an exception from Objective-C and 'catch' it in
     C++, or vice versa (i.e., 'throw ... @catch').

8.8 Synchronization
===================

GNU Objective-C provides support for synchronized blocks:

       @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
         ...
       }

 Upon entering the '@synchronized' block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding 'guard'
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait
until the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once 'guard' becomes
available, the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the
code contained in the '@synchronized' block, and finally relinquish the
lock (thereby making 'guard' available to other threads).

 Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
'@synchronized'.  Note that throwing exceptions out of '@synchronized'
blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object to be unlocked
properly.

 Because of the interactions between synchronization and exception
handling, you can only use '@synchronized' when compiling with
exceptions enabled, that is with the command line option
'-fobjc-exceptions'.

8.9.1 Using fast enumeration
----------------------------

GNU Objective-C provides support for the fast enumeration syntax:

       id array = ...;
       id object;

       for (object in array)
       {
         /* Do something with 'object' */
       }

 'array' needs to be an Objective-C object (usually a collection object,
for example an array, a dictionary or a set) which implements the "Fast
Enumeration Protocol" (see below).  If you are using a Foundation
library such as GNUstep Base or Apple Cocoa Foundation, all collection
objects in the library implement this protocol and can be used in this
way.

 The code above would iterate over all objects in 'array'.  For each of
them, it assigns it to 'object', then executes the 'Do something with
'object'' statements.

 Here is a fully worked-out example using a Foundation library (which
provides the implementation of 'NSArray', 'NSString' and 'NSLog'):

       NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"1", @"2", @"3", nil];
       NSString *object;

       for (object in array)
         NSLog (@"Iterating over %@", object);

8.9.2 c99-like fast enumeration syntax
--------------------------------------

A c99-like declaration syntax is also allowed:

       id array = ...;

       for (id object in array)
       {
         /* Do something with 'object'  */
       }

 this is completely equivalent to:

       id array = ...;

       {
         id object;
         for (object in array)
         {
           /* Do something with 'object'  */
         }
       }

 but can save some typing.

 Note that the option '-std=c99' is not required to allow this syntax in
Objective-C.

8.9.3 Fast enumeration details
------------------------------

Here is a more technical description with the gory details.  Consider
the code

       for (OBJECT EXPRESSION in COLLECTION EXPRESSION)
       {
         STATEMENTS
       }

 here is what happens when you run it:

   * 'COLLECTION EXPRESSION' is evaluated exactly once and the result is
     used as the collection object to iterate over.  This means it is
     safe to write code such as 'for (object in [NSDictionary
     keyEnumerator]) ...'.

   * the iteration is implemented by the compiler by repeatedly getting
     batches of objects from the collection object using the fast
     enumeration protocol (see below), then iterating over all objects
     in the batch.  This is faster than a normal enumeration where
     objects are retrieved one by one (hence the name "fast
     enumeration").

   * if there are no objects in the collection, then 'OBJECT EXPRESSION'
     is set to 'nil' and the loop immediately terminates.

   * if there are objects in the collection, then for each object in the
     collection (in the order they are returned) 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' is
     set to the object, then 'STATEMENTS' are executed.

   * 'STATEMENTS' can contain 'break' and 'continue' commands, which
     will abort the iteration or skip to the next loop iteration as
     expected.

   * when the iteration ends because there are no more objects to
     iterate over, 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' is set to 'nil'.  This allows you
     to determine whether the iteration finished because a 'break'
     command was used (in which case 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' will remain set
     to the last object that was iterated over) or because it iterated
     over all the objects (in which case 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' will be set
     to 'nil').

   * 'STATEMENTS' must not make any changes to the collection object; if
     they do, it is a hard error and the fast enumeration terminates by
     invoking 'objc_enumerationMutation', a runtime function that
     normally aborts the program but which can be customized by
     Foundation libraries via 'objc_set_mutation_handler' to do
     something different, such as raising an exception.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Fast enumeration protocol,  Prev: Fast enumeration details,  Up: Fast enumeration

8.9.4 Fast enumeration protocol
-------------------------------

If you want your own collection object to be usable with fast
enumeration, you need to have it implement the method

     - (unsigned long) countByEnumeratingWithState: (NSFastEnumerationState *)state
                                           objects: (id *)objects
                                             count: (unsigned long)len;

 where 'NSFastEnumerationState' must be defined in your code as follows:

     typedef struct
     {
       unsigned long state;
       id            *itemsPtr;
       unsigned long *mutationsPtr;
       unsigned long extra[5];
     } NSFastEnumerationState;

 If no 'NSFastEnumerationState' is defined in your code, the compiler
will automatically replace 'NSFastEnumerationState *' with 'struct
__objcFastEnumerationState *', where that type is silently defined by
the compiler in an identical way.  This can be confusing and we
recommend that you define 'NSFastEnumerationState' (as shown above)
instead.

 The method is called repeatedly during a fast enumeration to retrieve
batches of objects.  Each invocation of the method should retrieve the
next batch of objects.

 The return value of the method is the number of objects in the current
batch; this should not exceed 'len', which is the maximum size of a
batch as requested by the caller.  The batch itself is returned in the
'itemsPtr' field of the 'NSFastEnumerationState' struct.

 To help with returning the objects, the 'objects' array is a C array
preallocated by the caller (on the stack) of size 'len'.  In many cases
you can put the objects you want to return in that 'objects' array, then
do 'itemsPtr = objects'.  But you don't have to; if your collection
already has the objects to return in some form of C array, it could
return them from there instead.

 The 'state' and 'extra' fields of the 'NSFastEnumerationState'
structure allows your collection object to keep track of the state of
the enumeration.  In a simple array implementation, 'state' may keep
track of the index of the last object that was returned, and 'extra' may
be unused.

 The 'mutationsPtr' field of the 'NSFastEnumerationState' is used to
keep track of mutations.  It should point to a number; before working on
each object, the fast enumeration loop will check that this number has
not changed.  If it has, a mutation has happened and the fast
enumeration will abort.  So, 'mutationsPtr' could be set to point to
some sort of version number of your collection, which is increased by
one every time there is a change (for example when an object is added or
removed).  Or, if you are content with less strict mutation checks, it
could point to the number of objects in your collection or some other
value that can be checked to perform an approximate check that the
collection has not been mutated.

 Finally, note how we declared the 'len' argument and the return value
to be of type 'unsigned long'.  They could also be declared to be of
type 'unsigned int' and everything would still work.

8.10 Messaging with the GNU Objective-C runtime
===============================================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 The implementation of messaging in the GNU Objective-C runtime is
designed to be portable, and so is based on standard C.

 Sending a message in the GNU Objective-C runtime is composed of two
separate steps.  First, there is a call to the lookup function,
'objc_msg_lookup ()' (or, in the case of messages to super,
'objc_msg_lookup_super ()').  This runtime function takes as argument
the receiver and the selector of the method to be called; it returns the
'IMP', that is a pointer to the function implementing the method.  The
second step of method invocation consists of casting this pointer
function to the appropriate function pointer type, and calling the
function pointed to it with the right arguments.

 For example, when the compiler encounters a method invocation such as
'[object init]', it compiles it into a call to 'objc_msg_lookup (object,
@selector(init))' followed by a cast of the returned value to the
appropriate function pointer type, and then it calls it.

* Menu:

* Dynamically registering methods::
* Forwarding hook::


File: gcc.info,  Node: Dynamically registering methods,  Next: Forwarding hook,  Up: Messaging with the GNU Objective-C runtime

8.10.1 Dynamically registering methods
--------------------------------------

If 'objc_msg_lookup()' does not find a suitable method implementation,
because the receiver does not implement the required method, it tries to
see if the class can dynamically register the method.

 To do so, the runtime checks if the class of the receiver implements
the method

     + (BOOL) resolveInstanceMethod: (SEL)selector;

 in the case of an instance method, or

     + (BOOL) resolveClassMethod: (SEL)selector;

 in the case of a class method.  If the class implements it, the runtime
invokes it, passing as argument the selector of the original method, and
if it returns 'YES', the runtime tries the lookup again, which could now
succeed if a matching method was added dynamically by
'+resolveInstanceMethod:' or '+resolveClassMethod:'.

 This allows classes to dynamically register methods (by adding them to
the class using 'class_addMethod') when they are first called.  To do
so, a class should implement '+resolveInstanceMethod:' (or, depending on
the case, '+resolveClassMethod:') and have it recognize the selectors of
methods that can be registered dynamically at runtime, register them,
and return 'YES'.  It should return 'NO' for methods that it does not
dynamically registered at runtime.

 If '+resolveInstanceMethod:' (or '+resolveClassMethod:') is not
implemented or returns 'NO', the runtime then tries the forwarding hook.

 Support for '+resolveInstanceMethod:' and 'resolveClassMethod:' was
added to the GNU Objective-C runtime in GCC version 4.6.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Forwarding hook,  Prev: Dynamically registering methods,  Up: Messaging with the GNU Objective-C runtime

8.10.2 Forwarding hook
----------------------

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a hook, called
'__objc_msg_forward2', which is called by 'objc_msg_lookup()' when it
can't find a method implementation in the runtime tables and after
calling '+resolveInstanceMethod:' and '+resolveClassMethod:' has been
attempted and did not succeed in dynamically registering the method.

 To configure the hook, you set the global variable
'__objc_msg_forward2' to a function with the same argument and return
types of 'objc_msg_lookup()'.  When 'objc_msg_lookup()' can not find a
method implementation, it invokes the hook function you provided to get
a method implementation to return.  So, in practice
'__objc_msg_forward2' allows you to extend 'objc_msg_lookup()' by adding
some custom code that is called to do a further lookup when no standard
method implementation can be found using the normal lookup.

 This hook is generally reserved for "Foundation" libraries such as
GNUstep Base, which use it to implement their high-level method
forwarding API, typically based around the 'forwardInvocation:' method.
So, unless you are implementing your own "Foundation" library, you
should not set this hook.

 In a typical forwarding implementation, the '__objc_msg_forward2' hook
function determines the argument and return type of the method that is
being looked up, and then creates a function that takes these arguments
and has that return type, and returns it to the caller.  Creating this
function is non-trivial and is typically performed using a dedicated
library such as 'libffi'.

 The forwarding method implementation thus created is returned by
'objc_msg_lookup()' and is executed as if it was a normal method
implementation.  When the forwarding method implementation is called, it
is usually expected to pack all arguments into some sort of object
(typically, an 'NSInvocation' in a "Foundation" library), and hand it
over to the programmer ('forwardInvocation:') who is then allowed to
manipulate the method invocation using a high-level API provided by the
"Foundation" library.  For example, the programmer may want to examine
the method invocation arguments and name and potentially change them
before forwarding the method invocation to one or more local objects
('performInvocation:') or even to remote objects (by using Distributed
Objects or some other mechanism).  When all this completes, the return
value is passed back and must be returned correctly to the original
caller.

 Note that the GNU Objective-C runtime currently provides no support for
method forwarding or method invocations other than the
'__objc_msg_forward2' hook.

 If the forwarding hook does not exist or returns 'NULL', the runtime
currently attempts forwarding using an older, deprecated API, and if
that fails, it aborts the program.  In future versions of the GNU
Objective-C runtime, the runtime will immediately abort.

9 Binary Compatibility
**********************

Binary compatibility encompasses several related concepts:

"application binary interface (ABI)"
     The set of runtime conventions followed by all of the tools that
     deal with binary representations of a program, including compilers,
     assemblers, linkers, and language runtime support.  Some ABIs are
     formal with a written specification, possibly designed by multiple
     interested parties.  Others are simply the way things are actually
     done by a particular set of tools.

"ABI conformance"
     A compiler conforms to an ABI if it generates code that follows all
     of the specifications enumerated by that ABI.  A library conforms
     to an ABI if it is implemented according to that ABI.  An
     application conforms to an ABI if it is built using tools that
     conform to that ABI and does not contain source code that
     specifically changes behavior specified by the ABI.

"calling conventions"
     Calling conventions are a subset of an ABI that specify of how
     arguments are passed and function results are returned.

"interoperability"
     Different sets of tools are interoperable if they generate files
     that can be used in the same program.  The set of tools includes
     compilers, assemblers, linkers, libraries, header files, startup
     files, and debuggers.  Binaries produced by different sets of tools
     are not interoperable unless they implement the same ABI.  This
     applies to different versions of the same tools as well as tools
     from different vendors.

"intercallability"
     Whether a function in a binary built by one set of tools can call a
     function in a binary built by a different set of tools is a subset
     of interoperability.

"implementation-defined features"
     Language standards include lists of implementation-defined features
     whose behavior can vary from one implementation to another.  Some
     of these features are normally covered by a platform's ABI and
     others are not.  The features that are not covered by an ABI
     generally affect how a program behaves, but not intercallability.

"compatibility"
     Conformance to the same ABI and the same behavior of
     implementation-defined features are both relevant for
     compatibility.

 The application binary interface implemented by a C or C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:

   * size and alignment of data types
   * layout of structured types
   * calling conventions
   * register usage conventions
   * interfaces for runtime arithmetic support
   * object file formats

 In addition, the application binary interface implemented by a C++
compiler affects code generation and runtime support for:
   * name mangling
   * exception handling
   * invoking constructors and destructors
   * layout, alignment, and padding of classes
   * layout and alignment of virtual tables

 Some GCC compilation options cause the compiler to generate code that
does not conform to the platform's default ABI.  Other options cause
different program behavior for implementation-defined features that are
not covered by an ABI.  These options are provided for consistency with
other compilers that do not follow the platform's default ABI or the
usual behavior of implementation-defined features for the platform.  Be
very careful about using such options.

 Most platforms have a well-defined ABI that covers C code, but ABIs
that cover C++ functionality are not yet common.

 Starting with GCC 3.2, GCC binary conventions for C++ are based on a
written, vendor-neutral C++ ABI that was designed to be specific to
64-bit Itanium but also includes generic specifications that apply to
any platform.  This C++ ABI is also implemented by other compiler
vendors on some platforms, notably GNU/Linux and BSD systems.  We have
tried hard to provide a stable ABI that will be compatible with future
GCC releases, but it is possible that we will encounter problems that
make this difficult.  Such problems could include different
interpretations of the C++ ABI by different vendors, bugs in the ABI, or
bugs in the implementation of the ABI in different compilers.  GCC's
'-Wabi' switch warns when G++ generates code that is probably not
compatible with the C++ ABI.

 The C++ library used with a C++ compiler includes the Standard C++
Library, with functionality defined in the C++ Standard, plus language
runtime support.  The runtime support is included in a C++ ABI, but
there is no formal ABI for the Standard C++ Library.  Two
implementations of that library are interoperable if one follows the
de-facto ABI of the other and if they are both built with the same
compiler, or with compilers that conform to the same ABI for C++
compiler and runtime support.

 When G++ and another C++ compiler conform to the same C++ ABI, but the
implementations of the Standard C++ Library that they normally use do
not follow the same ABI for the Standard C++ Library, object files built
with those compilers can be used in the same program only if they use
the same C++ library.  This requires specifying the location of the C++
library header files when invoking the compiler whose usual library is
not being used.  The location of GCC's C++ header files depends on how
the GCC build was configured, but can be seen by using the G++ '-v'
option.  With default configuration options for G++ 3.3 the compile line
for a different C++ compiler needs to include

         -IGCC_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/include/c++/3.3

 Similarly, compiling code with G++ that must use a C++ library other
than the GNU C++ library requires specifying the location of the header
files for that other library.

 The most straightforward way to link a program to use a particular C++
library is to use a C++ driver that specifies that C++ library by
default.  The 'g++' driver, for example, tells the linker where to find
GCC's C++ library ('libstdc++') plus the other libraries and startup
files it needs, in the proper order.

 If a program must use a different C++ library and it's not possible to
do the final link using a C++ driver that uses that library by default,
it is necessary to tell 'g++' the location and name of that library.  It
might also be necessary to specify different startup files and other
runtime support libraries, and to suppress the use of GCC's support
libraries with one or more of the options '-nostdlib', '-nostartfiles',
and '-nodefaultlibs'.

10.1 Introduction to 'gcov'
===========================

'gcov' is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC to
analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code
and to discover untested parts of your program.  You can use 'gcov' as a
profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will
best affect your code.  You can also use 'gcov' along with the other
profiling tool, 'gprof', to assess which parts of your code use the
greatest amount of computing time.

 Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
profiler such as 'gcov' or 'gprof', you can find out some basic
performance statistics, such as:

   * how often each line of code executes

   * what lines of code are actually executed

   * how much computing time each section of code uses

 Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you
can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized.
'gcov' helps you determine where to work on optimization.

 Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release.
Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
final product.

 You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
'gcov' because the optimization, by combining some lines of code into
one function, may not give you as much information as you need to look
for 'hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.
Likewise, because 'gcov' accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest
resolution), it works best with a programming style that places only one
statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros that expand to
loops or to other control structures, the statistics are less
helpful--they only report on the line where the macro call appears.  If
your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace them with
inline functions to solve this problem.

 'gcov' creates a logfile called 'SOURCEFILE.gcov' which indicates how
many times each line of a source file 'SOURCEFILE.c' has executed.  You
can use these logfiles along with 'gprof' to aid in fine-tuning the
performance of your programs.  'gprof' gives timing information you can
use along with the information you get from 'gcov'.

 'gcov' works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not compatible with
any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

10.2 Invoking 'gcov'
====================

     gcov [OPTIONS] FILES

 'gcov' accepts the following options:

'-h'
'--help'
     Display help about using 'gcov' (on the standard output), and exit
     without doing any further processing.

'-v'
'--version'
     Display the 'gcov' version number (on the standard output), and
     exit without doing any further processing.

'-a'
'--all-blocks'
     Write individual execution counts for every basic block.  Normally
     gcov outputs execution counts only for the main blocks of a line.
     With this option you can determine if blocks within a single line
     are not being executed.

'-b'
'--branch-probabilities'
     Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch
     summary info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see
     how often each branch in your program was taken.  Unconditional
     branches will not be shown, unless the '-u' option is given.

'-c'
'--branch-counts'
     Write branch frequencies as the number of branches taken, rather
     than the percentage of branches taken.

'-n'
'--no-output'
     Do not create the 'gcov' output file.

'-l'
'--long-file-names'
     Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if
     the header file 'x.h' contains code, and was included in the file
     'a.c', then running 'gcov' on the file 'a.c' will produce an output
     file called 'a.c##x.h.gcov' instead of 'x.h.gcov'.  This can be
     useful if 'x.h' is included in multiple source files and you want
     to see the individual contributions.  If you use the '-p' option,
     both the including and included file names will be complete path
     names.

'-p'
'--preserve-paths'
     Preserve complete path information in the names of generated
     '.gcov' files.  Without this option, just the filename component is
     used.  With this option, all directories are used, with '/'
     characters translated to '#' characters, '.' directory components
     removed and unremoveable '..' components renamed to '^'.  This is
     useful if sourcefiles are in several different directories.

'-r'
'--relative-only'
     Only output information about source files with a relative pathname
     (after source prefix elision).  Absolute paths are usually system
     header files and coverage of any inline functions therein is
     normally uninteresting.

'-f'
'--function-summaries'
     Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level
     summary.

'-o DIRECTORY|FILE'
'--object-directory DIRECTORY'
'--object-file FILE'
     Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the
     object path name.  The '.gcno', and '.gcda' data files are searched
     for using this option.  If a directory is specified, the data files
     are in that directory and named after the input file name, without
     its extension.  If a file is specified here, the data files are
     named after that file, without its extension.

'-s DIRECTORY'
'--source-prefix DIRECTORY'
     A prefix for source file names to remove when generating the output
     coverage files.  This option is useful when building in a separate
     directory, and the pathname to the source directory is not wanted
     when determining the output file names.  Note that this prefix
     detection is applied before determining whether the source file is
     absolute.

'-u'
'--unconditional-branches'
     When branch probabilities are given, include those of unconditional
     branches.  Unconditional branches are normally not interesting.

'-d'
'--display-progress'
     Display the progress on the standard output.

'-i'
'--intermediate-format'
     Output gcov file in an easy-to-parse intermediate text format that
     can be used by 'lcov' or other tools.  The output is a single
     '.gcov' file per '.gcda' file.  No source code is required.

     The format of the intermediate '.gcov' file is plain text with one
     entry per line

          file:SOURCE_FILE_NAME
          function:LINE_NUMBER,EXECUTION_COUNT,FUNCTION_NAME
          lcount:LINE NUMBER,EXECUTION_COUNT
          branch:LINE_NUMBER,BRANCH_COVERAGE_TYPE

          Where the BRANCH_COVERAGE_TYPE is
             notexec (Branch not executed)
             taken (Branch executed and taken)
             nottaken (Branch executed, but not taken)

          There can be multiple FILE entries in an intermediate gcov
          file. All entries following a FILE pertain to that source file
          until the next FILE entry.

     Here is a sample when '-i' is used in conjunction with '-b' option:

          file:array.cc
          function:11,1,_Z3sumRKSt6vectorIPiSaIS0_EE
          function:22,1,main
          lcount:11,1
          lcount:12,1
          lcount:14,1
          branch:14,taken
          lcount:26,1
          branch:28,nottaken

'-m'
'--demangled-names'
     Display demangled function names in output.  The default is to show
     mangled function names.

 'gcov' should be run with the current directory the same as that when
you invoked the compiler.  Otherwise it will not be able to locate the
source files.  'gcov' produces files called 'MANGLEDNAME.gcov' in the
current directory.  These contain the coverage information of the source
file they correspond to.  One '.gcov' file is produced for each source
(or header) file containing code, which was compiled to produce the data
files.  The MANGLEDNAME part of the output file name is usually simply
the source file name, but can be something more complicated if the '-l'
or '-p' options are given.  Refer to those options for details.

 If you invoke 'gcov' with multiple input files, the contributions from
each input file are summed.  Typically you would invoke it with the same
list of files as the final link of your executable.

 The '.gcov' files contain the ':' separated fields along with program
source code.  The format is

     EXECUTION_COUNT:LINE_NUMBER:SOURCE LINE TEXT

 Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option.  The EXECUTION_COUNT is '-' for lines containing no
code.  Unexecuted lines are marked '#####' or '====', depending on
whether they are reachable by non-exceptional paths or only exceptional
paths such as C++ exception handlers, respectively.

 Some lines of information at the start have LINE_NUMBER of zero.  These
preamble lines are of the form

     -:0:TAG:VALUE

 The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented as
'gcov' development progresses -- do not rely on them remaining
unchanged.  Use TAG to locate a particular preamble line.

 The additional block information is of the form

     TAG INFORMATION

 The INFORMATION is human readable, but designed to be simple enough for
machine parsing too.

 When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values
are _exactly_ 0% and 100% respectively.  Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the
nearest non-boundary value.

 When using 'gcov', you must first compile your program with two special
GCC options: '-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage'.  This tells the compiler
to generate additional information needed by gcov (basically a flow
graph of the program) and also includes additional code in the object
files for generating the extra profiling information needed by gcov.
These additional files are placed in the directory where the object file
is located.

 Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For
each source file compiled with '-fprofile-arcs', an accompanying '.gcda'
file will be placed in the object file directory.

 Running 'gcov' with your program's source file names as arguments will
now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution for
each line.  For example, if your program is called 'tmp.c', this is what
you see when you use the basic 'gcov' facility:

     $ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.c
     $ a.out
     $ gcov tmp.c
     90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
     Creating tmp.c.gcov.

 The file 'tmp.c.gcov' contains output from 'gcov'.  Here is a sample:

             -:    0:Source:tmp.c
             -:    0:Graph:tmp.gcno
             -:    0:Data:tmp.gcda
             -:    0:Runs:1
             -:    0:Programs:1
             -:    1:#include <stdio.h>
             -:    2:
             -:    3:int main (void)
             1:    4:{
             1:    5:  int i, total;
             -:    6:
             1:    7:  total = 0;
             -:    8:
            11:    9:  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            10:   10:    total += i;
             -:   11:
             1:   12:  if (total != 45)
         #####:   13:    printf ("Failure\n");
             -:   14:  else
             1:   15:    printf ("Success\n");
             1:   16:  return 0;
             -:   17:}

 When you use the '-a' option, you will get individual block counts, and
the output looks like this:

             -:    0:Source:tmp.c
             -:    0:Graph:tmp.gcno
             -:    0:Data:tmp.gcda
             -:    0:Runs:1
             -:    0:Programs:1
             -:    1:#include <stdio.h>
             -:    2:
             -:    3:int main (void)
             1:    4:{
             1:    4-block  0
             1:    5:  int i, total;
             -:    6:
             1:    7:  total = 0;
             -:    8:
            11:    9:  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            11:    9-block  0
            10:   10:    total += i;
            10:   10-block  0
             -:   11:
             1:   12:  if (total != 45)
             1:   12-block  0
         #####:   13:    printf ("Failure\n");
         $$$$$:   13-block  0
             -:   14:  else
             1:   15:    printf ("Success\n");
             1:   15-block  0
             1:   16:  return 0;
             1:   16-block  0
             -:   17:}

 In this mode, each basic block is only shown on one line - the last
line of the block.  A multi-line block will only contribute to the
execution count of that last line, and other lines will not be shown to
contain code, unless previous blocks end on those lines.  The total
execution count of a line is shown and subsequent lines show the
execution counts for individual blocks that end on that line.  After
each block, the branch and call counts of the block will be shown, if
the '-b' option is given.

 Because of the way GCC instruments calls, a call count can be shown
after a line with no individual blocks.  As you can see, line 13
contains a basic block that was not executed.

 When you use the '-b' option, your output looks like this:

     $ gcov -b tmp.c
     90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
     80.00% of 5 branches executed in file tmp.c
     80.00% of 5 branches taken at least once in file tmp.c
     50.00% of 2 calls executed in file tmp.c
     Creating tmp.c.gcov.

 Here is a sample of a resulting 'tmp.c.gcov' file:

             -:    0:Source:tmp.c
             -:    0:Graph:tmp.gcno
             -:    0:Data:tmp.gcda
             -:    0:Runs:1
             -:    0:Programs:1
             -:    1:#include <stdio.h>
             -:    2:
             -:    3:int main (void)
     function main called 1 returned 1 blocks executed 75%
             1:    4:{
             1:    5:  int i, total;
             -:    6:
             1:    7:  total = 0;
             -:    8:
            11:    9:  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
     branch  0 taken 91% (fallthrough)
     branch  1 taken 9%
            10:   10:    total += i;
             -:   11:
             1:   12:  if (total != 45)
     branch  0 taken 0% (fallthrough)
     branch  1 taken 100%
         #####:   13:    printf ("Failure\n");
     call    0 never executed
             -:   14:  else
             1:   15:    printf ("Success\n");
     call    0 called 1 returned 100%
             1:   16:  return 0;
             -:   17:}

 For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the
function is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
function's blocks were executed.

 For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the
basic block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.
There can be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line
if there are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case,
the branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way
to map these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general,
though, the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the
leftmost construct on the source line.

 For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message "never executed" is printed.

 For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions that call 'exit' or 'longjmp', and
thus may not return every time they are called.

 The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the '.gcda' file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.

 The data in the '.gcda' files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with '-fprofile-arcs', the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing '.gcda' file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.

10.3 Using 'gcov' with GCC Optimization
=======================================

If you plan to use 'gcov' to help optimize your code, you must first
compile your program with two special GCC options: '-fprofile-arcs
-ftest-coverage'.  Aside from that, you can use any other GCC options;
but if you want to prove that every single line in your program was
executed, you should not compile with optimization at the same time.  On
some machines the optimizer can eliminate some simple code lines by
combining them with other lines.  For example, code like this:

     if (a != b)
       c = 1;
     else
       c = 0;

can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
there is no way for 'gcov' to calculate separate execution counts for
each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence the
'gcov' output looks like this if you compiled the program with
optimization:

           100:   12:if (a != b)
           100:   13:  c = 1;
           100:   14:else
           100:   15:  c = 0;

 The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
many times the result was 1.

 Inlineable functions can create unexpected line counts.  Line counts
are shown for the source code of the inlineable function, but what is
shown depends on where the function is inlined, or if it is not inlined
at all.

 If the function is not inlined, the compiler must emit an out of line
copy of the function, in any object file that needs it.  If 'fileA.o'
and 'fileB.o' both contain out of line bodies of a particular inlineable
function, they will also both contain coverage counts for that function.
When 'fileA.o' and 'fileB.o' are linked together, the linker will, on
many systems, select one of those out of line bodies for all calls to
that function, and remove or ignore the other.  Unfortunately, it will
not remove the coverage counters for the unused function body.  Hence
when instrumented, all but one use of that function will show zero
counts.

 If the function is inlined in several places, the block structure in
each location might not be the same.  For instance, a condition might
now be calculable at compile time in some instances.  Because the
coverage of all the uses of the inline function will be shown for the
same source lines, the line counts themselves might seem inconsistent.

 Long-running applications can use the '_gcov_reset' and '_gcov_dump'
facilities to restrict profile collection to the program region of
interest.  Calling '_gcov_reset(void)' will clear all profile counters
to zero, and calling '_gcov_dump(void)' will cause the profile
information collected at that point to be dumped to '.gcda' output
files.

10.4 Brief description of 'gcov' data files
===========================================

'gcov' uses two files for profiling.  The names of these files are
derived from the original _object_ file by substituting the file suffix
with either '.gcno', or '.gcda'.  The files contain coverage and profile
data stored in a platform-independent format.  The '.gcno' files are
placed in the same directory as the object file.  By default, the
'.gcda' files are also stored in the same directory as the object file,
but the GCC '-fprofile-dir' option may be used to store the '.gcda'
files in a separate directory.

 The '.gcno' notes file is generated when the source file is compiled
with the GCC '-ftest-coverage' option.  It contains information to
reconstruct the basic block graphs and assign source line numbers to
blocks.

 The '.gcda' count data file is generated when a program containing
object files built with the GCC '-fprofile-arcs' option is executed.  A
separate '.gcda' file is created for each object file compiled with this
option.  It contains arc transition counts, value profile counts, and
some summary information.

 The full details of the file format is specified in 'gcov-io.h', and
functions provided in that header file should be used to access the
coverage files.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Cross-profiling,  Prev: Gcov Data Files,  Up: Gcov

10.5 Data file relocation to support cross-profiling
====================================================

Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with '-fprofile-arcs', an accompanying '.gcda' file
will be placed in the object file directory.  That implicitly requires
running the program on the same system as it was built or having the
same absolute directory structure on the target system.  The program
will try to create the needed directory structure, if it is not already
present.

 To support cross-profiling, a program compiled with '-fprofile-arcs'
can relocate the data files based on two environment variables:

   * GCOV_PREFIX contains the prefix to add to the absolute paths in the
     object file.  Prefix can be absolute, or relative.  The default is
     no prefix.

   * GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP indicates the how many initial directory names to
     strip off the hardwired absolute paths.  Default value is 0.

     _Note:_ If GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP is set without GCOV_PREFIX is
     undefined, then a relative path is made out of the hardwired
     absolute paths.

 For example, if the object file '/user/build/foo.o' was built with
'-fprofile-arcs', the final executable will try to create the data file
'/user/build/foo.gcda' when running on the target system.  This will
fail if the corresponding directory does not exist and it is unable to
create it.  This can be overcome by, for example, setting the
environment as 'GCOV_PREFIX=/target/run' and 'GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP=1'.
Such a setting will name the data file '/target/run/build/foo.gcda'.

 You must move the data files to the expected directory tree in order to
use them for profile directed optimizations ('--use-profile'), or to use
the 'gcov' tool.

11 Known Causes of Trouble with GCC
***********************************

This section describes known problems that affect users of GCC.  Most of
these are not GCC bugs per se--if they were, we would fix them.  But the
result for a user may be like the result of a bug.

 Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.

* Menu:

* Actual Bugs::         Bugs we will fix later.
* Interoperation::      Problems using GCC with other compilers,
                        and with certain linkers, assemblers and debuggers.
* Incompatibilities::   GCC is incompatible with traditional C.
* Fixed Headers::       GCC uses corrected versions of system header files.
                        This is necessary, but doesn't always work smoothly.
* Standard Libraries::  GCC uses the system C library, which might not be
                        compliant with the ISO C standard.
* Disappointments::     Regrettable things we can't change, but not quite bugs.
* C++ Misunderstandings:: Common misunderstandings with GNU C++.
* Non-bugs::            Things we think are right, but some others disagree.

11.1 Actual Bugs We Haven't Fixed Yet
=====================================

   * The 'fixincludes' script interacts badly with automounters; if the
     directory of system header files is automounted, it tends to be
     unmounted while 'fixincludes' is running.  This would seem to be a
     bug in the automounter.  We don't know any good way to work around
     it.

11.2 Interoperation
===================

This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GCC
together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers, libraries
and debuggers on certain systems.

   * On many platforms, GCC supports a different ABI for C++ than do
     other compilers, so the object files compiled by GCC cannot be used
     with object files generated by another C++ compiler.

     An area where the difference is most apparent is name mangling.
     The use of different name mangling is intentional, to protect you
     from more subtle problems.  Compilers differ as to many internal
     details of C++ implementation, including: how class instances are
     laid out, how multiple inheritance is implemented, and how virtual
     function calls are handled.  If the name encoding were made the
     same, your programs would link against libraries provided from
     other compilers--but the programs would then crash when run.
     Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
     at run time.

   * On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of
     profiling causes static variable destructors (currently used only
     in C++) not to be run.

   * On a SPARC, GCC aligns all values of type 'double' on an 8-byte
     boundary, and it expects every 'double' to be so aligned.  The Sun
     compiler usually gives 'double' values 8-byte alignment, with one
     exception: function arguments of type 'double' may not be aligned.

     As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address
     of an argument of type 'double' and passes this pointer of type
     'double *' to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
     pointer may cause a fatal signal.

     One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program
     with GCC.  Another solution is to modify the function that is
     compiled with Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable;
     local variables are always properly aligned.  A third solution is
     to modify the function that uses the pointer to dereference it via
     the following function 'access_double' instead of directly with
     '*':

          inline double
          access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
          {
            union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };

            union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
            union d2i u;

            u.i[0] = p->i[0];
            u.i[1] = p->i[1];

            return u.d;
          }

     Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.

   * On Solaris, the 'malloc' function in the 'libmalloc.a' library may
     allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
     SPARC assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
     fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
     'libmalloc.a' library.

     The solution is to not use the 'libmalloc.a' library.  Use instead
     'malloc' and related functions from 'libc.a'; they do not have this
     problem.

   * On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions
     compiled with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions
     that use 'alloca' or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC
     doesn't generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It
     may even be impossible to generate them.

   * Debugging ('-g') is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you
     use the preliminary GNU tools.

   * Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX PA
     assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

   * Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static
     functions will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply
     is no way for GCC to specify what registers hold arguments for
     static functions when using the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does
     not have this problem.

   * In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
     receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of
     bounds unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often
     in previous versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If you
     should run into it, you can work around by making your function
     smaller.

   * GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX assembler
     of the form:

          (warning) Use of GR3 when
            frame >= 8192 may cause conflict.

     These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.

   * In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
     receive errors from the AIX Assembler complaining about a
     displacement that is too large.  If you should run into it, you can
     work around by making your function smaller.

   * The 'libstdc++.a' library in GCC relies on the SVR4 dynamic linker
     semantics which merges global symbols between libraries and
     applications, especially necessary for C++ streams functionality.
     This is not the default behavior of AIX shared libraries and
     dynamic linking.  'libstdc++.a' is built on AIX with
     "runtime-linking" enabled so that symbol merging can occur.  To
     utilize this feature, the application linked with 'libstdc++.a'
     must include the '-Wl,-brtl' flag on the link line.  G++ cannot
     impose this because this option may interfere with the semantics of
     the user program and users may not always use 'g++' to link his or
     her application.  Applications are not required to use the
     '-Wl,-brtl' flag on the link line--the rest of the 'libstdc++.a'
     library which is not dependent on the symbol merging semantics will
     continue to function correctly.

   * An application can interpose its own definition of functions for
     functions invoked by 'libstdc++.a' with "runtime-linking" enabled
     on AIX.  To accomplish this the application must be linked with
     "runtime-linking" option and the functions explicitly must be
     exported by the application ('-Wl,-brtl,-bE:exportfile').

   * AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
     locale-specific representations of various objects including
     floating-point numbers ('.' vs ',' for separating decimal
     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
     linked with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats
     that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set the
     'LANG' environment variable to 'C' or 'En_US'.

   * Even if you specify '-fdollars-in-identifiers', you cannot
     successfully use '$' in identifiers on the RS/6000 due to a
     restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these identifiers.

11.3 Incompatibilities of GCC
=============================

There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and K&R
(non-ISO) versions of C.

   * GCC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
     identical-looking string constants are used, GCC stores only one
     copy of the string.

     One consequence is that you cannot call 'mktemp' with a string
     constant argument.  The function 'mktemp' always alters the string
     its argument points to.

     Another consequence is that 'sscanf' does not work on some very old
     systems when passed a string constant as its format control string
     or input.  This is because 'sscanf' incorrectly tries to write into
     the string constant.  Likewise 'fscanf' and 'scanf'.

     The solution to these problems is to change the program to use
     'char'-array variables with initialization strings for these
     purposes instead of string constants.

   * '-2147483648' is positive.

     This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type 'int', so
     (following the ISO C rules) its data type is 'unsigned long int'.
     Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.

   * GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
     string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC

          #define foo(a) "a"

     will produce output '"a"' regardless of what the argument A is.

   * When you use 'setjmp' and 'longjmp', the only automatic variables
     guaranteed to remain valid are those declared 'volatile'.  This is
     a consequence of automatic register allocation.  Consider this
     function:

          jmp_buf j;

          foo ()
          {
            int a, b;

            a = fun1 ();
            if (setjmp (j))
              return a;

            a = fun2 ();
            /* 'longjmp (j)' may occur in 'fun3'. */
            return a + fun3 ();
          }

     Here 'a' may or may not be restored to its first value when the
     'longjmp' occurs.  If 'a' is allocated in a register, then its
     first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
     in it.

     If you use the '-W' option with the '-O' option, you will get a
     warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.

   * Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
     arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
     will not work:

          foobar (
          #define luser
                  hack)

     ISO C does not permit such a construct.

   * K&R compilers allow comments to cross over an inclusion boundary
     (i.e. started in an include file and ended in the including file).

   * Declarations of external variables and functions within a block
     apply only to the block containing the declaration.  In other
     words, they have the same scope as any other declaration in the
     same place.

     In some other C compilers, an 'extern' declaration affects all the
     rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

   * In traditional C, you can combine 'long', etc., with a typedef
     name, as shown here:

          typedef int foo;
          typedef long foo bar;

     In ISO C, this is not allowed: 'long' and other type modifiers
     require an explicit 'int'.

   * PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.

   * Traditional C allows the following erroneous pair of declarations
     to appear together in a given scope:

          typedef int foo;
          typedef foo foo;

   * GCC treats all characters of identifiers as significant.  According
     to K&R-1 (2.2), "No more than the first eight characters are
     significant, although more may be used.".  Also according to K&R-1
     (2.2), "An identifier is a sequence of letters and digits; the
     first character must be a letter.  The underscore _ counts as a
     letter.", but GCC also allows dollar signs in identifiers.

   * PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment
     operators such as '+='.  GCC, following the ISO standard, does not
     allow this.

   * GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
     preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
     comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if
     these comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an
     error.  For example, this code would produce an error:

          #if 0
          You can't expect this to work.
          #endif

     The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an
     actual C comment delimited by '/*...*/'.

   * Many user programs contain the declaration 'long time ();'.  In the
     past, the system header files on many systems did not actually
     declare 'time', so it did not matter what type your program
     declared it to return.  But in systems with ISO C headers, 'time'
     is declared to return 'time_t', and if that is not the same as
     'long', then 'long time ();' is erroneous.

     The solution is to change your program to use appropriate system
     headers ('<time.h>' on systems with ISO C headers) and not to
     declare 'time' if the system header files declare it, or failing
     that to use 'time_t' as the return type of 'time'.

   * When compiling functions that return 'float', PCC converts it to a
     double.  GCC actually returns a 'float'.  If you are concerned with
     PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
     'double'; you might as well say what you mean.

   * When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
     output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
     versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
     a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.

     The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
     1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or
     union with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the
     caller (usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines
     it is passed on the stack).  The target hook
     'TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' tells GCC where to pass this address.

     By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and
     unions of any size by copying the data into an area of static
     storage, and then returning the address of that storage as if it
     were a pointer value.  The caller must copy the data from that
     memory area to the place where the value is wanted.  GCC does not
     use this method because it is slower and nonreentrant.

     On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
     structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses
     a compatible convention when returning structures and unions in
     memory, but still returns small structures and unions in registers.

     You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure
     and union returning with the option '-fpcc-struct-return'.

   * GCC complains about program fragments such as '0x74ae-0x4000' which
     appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
     operator.  Actually, this string is a single "preprocessing token".
     Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this does
     not, GCC prints an error message.  Although it may appear obvious
     that what is meant is an operator and two values, the ISO C
     standard specifically requires that this be treated as erroneous.

     A "preprocessing token" is a "preprocessing number" if it begins
     with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
     periods and 'e+', 'e-', 'E+', 'E-', 'p+', 'p-', 'P+', or 'P-'
     character sequences.  (In strict C90 mode, the sequences 'p+',
     'p-', 'P+' and 'P-' cannot appear in preprocessing numbers.)

     To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in front
     of the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the preprocessing
     number.

11.4 Fixed Header Files
=======================

GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files.
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ISO C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.

 Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called 'fixincludes'.  Normally, you don't
need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it doesn't do
the right thing automatically.

   * If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a
     new system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not
     automatically updated.  They can be updated using the 'mkheaders'
     script installed in 'LIBEXECDIR/gcc/TARGET/VERSION/install-tools/'.

   * On some systems, header file directories contain machine-specific
     symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it possible to share
     most of the header files among hosts running the same version of
     the system on different machine models.

     The programs that fix the header files do not understand this
     special way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of
     fixed header files is good only for the machine model used to build
     it.

     It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
     different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links
     so as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Standard Libraries,  Next: Disappointments,  Prev: Fixed Headers,  Up: Trouble

11.5 Standard Libraries
=======================

GCC by itself attempts to be a conforming freestanding implementation.
*Note Language Standards Supported by GCC: Standards, for details of
what this means.  Beyond the library facilities required of such an
implementation, the rest of the C library is supplied by the vendor of
the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to the C
standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when using
'-Wall') that you don't expect.

 For example, the 'sprintf' function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns 'char *'
while the C standard says that 'sprintf' returns an 'int'.  The
'fixincludes' program could make the prototype for this function match
the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the function will still
return 'char *'.

 If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called 'glibc') provides
ISO C, POSIX, BSD, SystemV and X/Open compatibility for GNU/Linux and
HURD-based GNU systems; no recent version of it supports other systems,
though some very old versions did.  Version 2.2 of the GNU C library
includes nearly complete C99 support.  You could also ask your operating
system vendor if newer libraries are available.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Disappointments,  Next: C++ Misunderstandings,  Prev: Standard Libraries,  Up: Trouble

11.6 Disappointments and Misunderstandings
==========================================

These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.

   * Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you
     compile with optimization.

     This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
     existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
     value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that
     would be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the
     eliminated variable when it writes debugging information.

     You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
     executable and your source code, when you use optimization.

   * Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
     like this:

          int foo (struct mumble *);

          struct mumble { ... };

          int foo (struct mumble *x)
          { ... }

     This code really is erroneous, because the scope of 'struct mumble'
     in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it.  It
     does not refer to the 'struct mumble' defined with file scope
     immediately below--they are two unrelated types with similar names
     in different scopes.

     But in the definition of 'foo', the file-scope type is used because
     that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and the
     prototype do not match, and you get an error.

     This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ISO standard
     specifies.  It is easy enough for you to make your code work by
     moving the definition of 'struct mumble' above the prototype.  It's
     not worth being incompatible with ISO C just to avoid an error for
     the example shown above.

   * Accesses to bit-fields even in volatile objects works by accessing
     larger objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what
     size of object is accessed in order to read or write the bit-field;
     it may even vary for a given bit-field according to the precise
     usage.

     If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is
     accessed, use volatile but do not use bit-fields.

   * GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in
     system header files.  They install corrected copies of various
     header files in a special directory where only GCC will normally
     look for them.  The scripts adapt to various systems by searching
     all the system header files for the problem cases that we know
     about.

     If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically
     arranges to update the corrected header files.  They can be updated
     using the 'mkheaders' script installed in
     'LIBEXECDIR/gcc/TARGET/VERSION/install-tools/'.

   * On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical
     results if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.
     For example, you can find that a floating point value which is not
     a NaN is not equal to itself.  This results from the fact that the
     floating point registers hold a few more bits of precision than fit
     in a 'double' in memory.  Compiled code moves values between memory
     and floating point registers at its convenience, and moving them
     into memory truncates them.

     You can partially avoid this problem by using the '-ffloat-store'
     option (*note Optimize Options::).

   * On AIX and other platforms without weak symbol support, templates
     need to be instantiated explicitly and symbols for static members
     of templates will not be generated.

   * On AIX, GCC scans object files and library archives for static
     constructors and destructors when linking an application before the
     linker prunes unreferenced symbols.  This is necessary to prevent
     the AIX linker from mistakenly assuming that static constructor or
     destructor are unused and removing them before the scanning can
     occur.  All static constructors and destructors found will be
     referenced even though the modules in which they occur may not be
     used by the program.  This may lead to both increased executable
     size and unexpected symbol references.

11.7 Common Misunderstandings with GNU C++
==========================================

C++ is a complex language and an evolving one, and its standard
definition (the ISO C++ standard) was only recently completed.  As a
result, your C++ compiler may occasionally surprise you, even when its
behavior is correct.  This section discusses some areas that frequently
give rise to questions of this sort.

* Menu:

* Static Definitions::  Static member declarations are not definitions
* Name lookup::         Name lookup, templates, and accessing members of base classes
* Temporaries::         Temporaries may vanish before you expect
* Copy Assignment::     Copy Assignment operators copy virtual bases twice


File: gcc.info,  Node: Static Definitions,  Next: Name lookup,  Up: C++ Misunderstandings

11.7.1 Declare _and_ Define Static Members
------------------------------------------

When a class has static data members, it is not enough to _declare_ the
static member; you must also _define_ it.  For example:

     class Foo
     {
       ...
       void method();
       static int bar;
     };

 This declaration only establishes that the class 'Foo' has an 'int'
named 'Foo::bar', and a member function named 'Foo::method'.  But you
still need to define _both_ 'method' and 'bar' elsewhere.  According to
the ISO standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and only one)
source file, such as:

     int Foo::bar = 0;

 Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard behavior.
As a result, when you switch to 'g++' from one of these compilers, you
may discover that a program that appeared to work correctly in fact does
not conform to the standard: 'g++' reports as undefined symbols any
static data members that lack definitions.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Name lookup,  Next: Temporaries,  Prev: Static Definitions,  Up: C++ Misunderstandings

11.7.2 Name lookup, templates, and accessing members of base classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The C++ standard prescribes that all names that are not dependent on
template parameters are bound to their present definitions when parsing
a template function or class.(1)  Only names that are dependent are
looked up at the point of instantiation.  For example, consider

       void foo(double);

       struct A {
         template <typename T>
         void f () {
           foo (1);        // 1
           int i = N;      // 2
           T t;
           t.bar();        // 3
           foo (t);        // 4
         }

         static const int N;
       };

 Here, the names 'foo' and 'N' appear in a context that does not depend
on the type of 'T'.  The compiler will thus require that they are
defined in the context of use in the template, not only before the point
of instantiation, and will here use '::foo(double)' and 'A::N',
respectively.  In particular, it will convert the integer value to a
'double' when passing it to '::foo(double)'.

 Conversely, 'bar' and the call to 'foo' in the fourth marked line are
used in contexts that do depend on the type of 'T', so they are only
looked up at the point of instantiation, and you can provide
declarations for them after declaring the template, but before
instantiating it.  In particular, if you instantiate 'A::f<int>', the
last line will call an overloaded '::foo(int)' if one was provided, even
if after the declaration of 'struct A'.

 This distinction between lookup of dependent and non-dependent names is
called two-stage (or dependent) name lookup.  G++ implements it since
version 3.4.

 Two-stage name lookup sometimes leads to situations with behavior
different from non-template codes.  The most common is probably this:

       template <typename T> struct Base {
         int i;
       };

       template <typename T> struct Derived : public Base<T> {
         int get_i() { return i; }
       };

 In 'get_i()', 'i' is not used in a dependent context, so the compiler
will look for a name declared at the enclosing namespace scope (which is
the global scope here).  It will not look into the base class, since
that is dependent and you may declare specializations of 'Base' even
after declaring 'Derived', so the compiler can't really know what 'i'
would refer to.  If there is no global variable 'i', then you will get
an error message.

 In order to make it clear that you want the member of the base class,
you need to defer lookup until instantiation time, at which the base
class is known.  For this, you need to access 'i' in a dependent
context, by either using 'this->i' (remember that 'this' is of type
'Derived<T>*', so is obviously dependent), or using 'Base<T>::i'.
Alternatively, 'Base<T>::i' might be brought into scope by a
'using'-declaration.

 Another, similar example involves calling member functions of a base
class:

       template <typename T> struct Base {
           int f();
       };

       template <typename T> struct Derived : Base<T> {
           int g() { return f(); };
       };

 Again, the call to 'f()' is not dependent on template arguments (there
are no arguments that depend on the type 'T', and it is also not
otherwise specified that the call should be in a dependent context).
Thus a global declaration of such a function must be available, since
the one in the base class is not visible until instantiation time.  The
compiler will consequently produce the following error message:

       x.cc: In member function `int Derived<T>::g()':
       x.cc:6: error: there are no arguments to `f' that depend on a template
          parameter, so a declaration of `f' must be available
       x.cc:6: error: (if you use `-fpermissive', G++ will accept your code, but
          allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated)

 To make the code valid either use 'this->f()', or 'Base<T>::f()'.
Using the '-fpermissive' flag will also let the compiler accept the
code, by marking all function calls for which no declaration is visible
at the time of definition of the template for later lookup at
instantiation time, as if it were a dependent call.  We do not recommend
using '-fpermissive' to work around invalid code, and it will also only
catch cases where functions in base classes are called, not where
variables in base classes are used (as in the example above).

 Note that some compilers (including G++ versions prior to 3.4) get
these examples wrong and accept above code without an error.  Those
compilers do not implement two-stage name lookup correctly.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The C++ standard just uses the term "dependent" for names that
depend on the type or value of template parameters.  This shorter term
will also be used in the rest of this section.

11.7.3 Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect
-----------------------------------------------

It is dangerous to use pointers or references to _portions_ of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
especially ones that define a conversion function to type 'char *' or
'const char *'--which is one reason why the standard 'string' class
requires you to call the 'c_str' member function.  However, any class
that returns a pointer to some internal structure is potentially subject
to this problem.

 For example, a program may use a function 'strfunc' that returns
'string' objects, and another function 'charfunc' that operates on
pointers to 'char':

     string strfunc ();
     void charfunc (const char *);

     void
     f ()
     {
       const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
       ...
       charfunc (p);
       ...
       charfunc (p);
     }

In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
string returned by the 'c_str' member function and use that rather than
call 'c_str' repeatedly.  However, the temporary string created by the
call to 'strfunc' is destroyed after 'p' is initialized, at which point
'p' is left pointing to freed memory.

 Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
temporaries it is not portable.

 The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which
forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
example:

     const string& tmp = strfunc ();
     charfunc (tmp.c_str ());

11.7.4 Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases
-------------------------------------------------

When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object.  Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class.  However,
such objects behave unspecified when being assigned.  For example:

     struct Base{
       char *name;
       Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
       Base& operator= (const Base& other){
        free (name);
        name = strdup (other.name);
       }
     };

     struct A:virtual Base{
       int val;
       A():Base("A"){}
     };

     struct B:virtual Base{
       int bval;
       B():Base("B"){}
     };

     struct Derived:public A, public B{
       Derived():Base("Derived"){}
     };

     void func(Derived &d1, Derived &d2)
     {
       d1 = d2;
     }

 The C++ standard specifies that 'Base::Base' is only called once when
constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object.  It is unspecified
whether 'Base::operator=' is called more than once when the implicit
copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is inside 'func'
in the example).

 G++ implements the "intuitive" algorithm for copy-assignment: assign
all direct bases, then assign all members.  In that algorithm, the
virtual base subobject can be encountered more than once.  In the
example, copying proceeds in the following order: 'val', 'name' (via
'strdup'), 'bval', and 'name' again.

 If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties.  With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.

11.8 Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make
==========================================

This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which we
do not make because we think GCC is better without them.

   * Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has
     an old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

     Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that
     appear in the same file as the called function, following the
     definition.  The only way to check all calls reliably is to add a
     prototype for the function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the
     motivation for this feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

   * Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift
     count.

     Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
     Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

   * Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

     Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would
     cause more annoyance than good.

   * Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

     C contains many standard functions that return a value that most
     programs choose to ignore.  One obvious example is 'printf'.
     Warning about this practice only leads the defensive programmer to
     clutter programs with dozens of casts to 'void'.  Such casts are
     required so frequently that they become visual noise.  Writing
     those casts becomes so automatic that they no longer convey useful
     information about the intentions of the programmer.  For functions
     where the return value should never be ignored, use the
     'warn_unused_result' function attribute (*note Function
     Attributes::).

   * Making '-fshort-enums' the default.

     This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other
     C compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you
     can get the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters
     most is when the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure,
     and in that case you can specify a field width explicitly.

   * Making bit-fields unsigned by default on particular machines where
     "the ABI standard" says to do so.

     The ISO C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a
     bit-field declared plain 'int' is signed or not.  This in effect
     creates two alternative dialects of C.

     The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the
     signed dialect with '-fsigned-bitfields' and the unsigned dialect
     with '-funsigned-bitfields'.  However, this leaves open the
     question of which dialect to use by default.

     Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bit-fields signed,
     because this is simplest.  Since 'int' is the same as 'signed int'
     in every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in
     bit-fields as well.

     Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary
     Interface standards which specify that plain bit-fields should be
     unsigned.  It is a mistake, however, to say anything about this
     issue in an ABI.  This is because the handling of plain bit-fields
     distinguishes two dialects of C.  Both dialects are meaningful on
     every type of machine.  Whether a particular object file was
     compiled using signed bit-fields or unsigned is of no concern to
     other object files, even if they access the same bit-fields in the
     same data structures.

     A given program is written in one or the other of these two
     dialects.  The program stands a chance to work on most any machine
     if it is compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work
     at all if compiled with the wrong dialect.

     Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
     environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
     inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bit-fields differently
     on certain machines.

     Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular
     machine type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the
     GNU C compiler were to support by default the same dialect as the
     other compilers on that machine.  But such applications are rare.
     And users writing a program to run on more than one type of machine
     cannot possibly benefit from this kind of compatibility.

     This is why GCC does and will treat plain bit-fields in the same
     fashion on all types of machines (by default).

     There are some arguments for making bit-fields unsigned by default
     on all machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de
     facto standard, it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.
     This is something to be considered in the future.

     (Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should
     indicate explicitly in each bit-field whether it is signed or not.
     In this way, they write programs which have the same meaning in
     both C dialects.)

   * Undefining '__STDC__' when '-ansi' is not used.

     Currently, GCC defines '__STDC__' unconditionally.  This provides
     good results in practice.

     Programmers normally use conditionals on '__STDC__' to ask whether
     it is safe to use certain features of ISO C, such as function
     prototypes or ISO token concatenation.  Since plain 'gcc' supports
     all the features of ISO C, the correct answer to these questions is
     "yes".

     Some users try to use '__STDC__' to check for the availability of
     certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an
     ISO C program, because the ISO C standard says that a conforming
     freestanding implementation should define '__STDC__' even though it
     does not have the library facilities.  'gcc -ansi -pedantic' is a
     conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore
     required to define '__STDC__', even though it does not come with an
     ISO C library.

     Sometimes people say that defining '__STDC__' in a compiler that
     does not completely conform to the ISO C standard somehow violates
     the standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for
     compilers that claim to support ISO C, such as 'gcc -ansi'--not for
     other compilers such as plain 'gcc'.  Whatever the ISO C standard
     says is relevant to the design of plain 'gcc' without '-ansi' only
     for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

     GCC normally defines '__STDC__' to be 1, and in addition defines
     '__STRICT_ANSI__' if you specify the '-ansi' option, or a '-std'
     option for strict conformance to some version of ISO C.  On some
     hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
     '__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
     conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention
     when processing system include files, but when processing user
     files it follows the usual GNU C convention.

   * Undefining '__STDC__' in C++.

     Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the value
     of '__STDC__' that goes with the C compiler that is subsequently
     used.  These programs must test '__STDC__' to determine what kind
     of C preprocessor that compiler uses: whether they should
     concatenate tokens in the ISO C fashion or in the traditional
     fashion.

     These programs work properly with GNU C++ if '__STDC__' is defined.
     They would not work otherwise.

     In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in
     ISO C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can
     work without change in C++ provided '__STDC__' is defined.  If
     '__STDC__' is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to
     be changed to test explicitly for C++ as well.

   * Deleting "empty" loops.

     Historically, GCC has not deleted "empty" loops under the
     assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a
     program is to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real
     programs run any faster.

     However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
     cannot produce an empty one.  This held for carefully written C
     compiled with less powerful optimizers but is not always the case
     for carefully written C++ or with more powerful optimizers.  Thus
     GCC will remove operations from loops whenever it can determine
     those operations are not externally visible (apart from the time
     taken to execute them, of course).  In case the loop can be proved
     to be finite, GCC will also remove the loop itself.

     Be aware of this when performing timing tests, for instance the
     following loop can be completely removed, provided
     'some_expression' can provably not change any global state.

          {
             int sum = 0;
             int ix;

             for (ix = 0; ix != 10000; ix++)
                sum += some_expression;
          }

     Even though 'sum' is accumulated in the loop, no use is made of
     that summation, so the accumulation can be removed.

   * Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other
     compiler.

     It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side
     effects.  For example, a function call like this may very well
     behave differently from one compiler to another:

          void func (int, int);

          int i = 2;
          func (i++, i++);

     There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
     definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any
     particular order.  Either increment might happen first.  'func'
     might get the arguments '2, 3', or it might get '3, 2', or even '2,
     2'.

   * Making certain warnings into errors by default.

     Some ISO C testsuites report failure when the compiler does not
     produce an error message for a certain program.

     ISO C requires a "diagnostic" message for certain kinds of invalid
     programs, but a warning is defined by GCC to count as a diagnostic.
     If GCC produces a warning but not an error, that is correct ISO C
     support.  If testsuites call this "failure", they should be run
     with the GCC option '-pedantic-errors', which will turn these
     warnings into errors.

11.9 Warning Messages and Error Messages
========================================

The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:

     "Errors" report problems that make it impossible to compile your
     program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
     number where the problem is apparent.

     "Warnings" report other unusual conditions in your code that _may_
     indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does) proceed.
     Warning messages also report the source file name and line number,
     but include the text 'warning:' to distinguish them from error
     messages.

 Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the '-W'
options (for instance, '-Wall' requests a variety of useful warnings).

 GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic _must_ be issued by a conforming compiler.
The '-pedantic' option tells GCC to issue warnings in such cases;
'-pedantic-errors' says to make them errors instead.  This does not mean
that _all_ non-ISO constructs get warnings or errors.

more detail on these and related command-line options.

File: gcc.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Bugs

12.1 Have You Found a Bug?
==========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

   * If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input
     whatever (except an 'asm' statement), that is a compiler bug,
     unless the compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would
     ordinarily prevent the assembler from being run.

   * If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not
     correctly execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

     However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have a
     program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to
     give the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.

     For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write 'x;' at
     the end of a function instead of 'return x;', with the same
     results.  But the value of the function is undefined if 'return' is
     omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.

     Problems often result from expressions with two increment
     operators, as in 'f (*p++, *p++)'.  Your previous compiler might
     have interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
     interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
     in your code.

     After you have localized the error to a single source line, it
     should be easy to check for these things.  If your program is
     correct and well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

   * If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is
     a compiler bug.

   * If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid
     input, that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your
     idea of "invalid input" might be someone else's idea of "an
     extension" or "support for traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of one of the languages GCC
     supports, your suggestions for improvement of GCC are welcome in
     any case.

Funding Free Software
*********************

If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

 Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

 The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors they
must compete to be the one who gives the most.

 To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

 Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.  If
the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less
than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

 Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful
too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do,
and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute
more; major new features or packages contribute the most.

 By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

The GNU Project and GNU/Linux
*****************************

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.  (GNU is a
recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix"; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".)
Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are
now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as "Linux",
they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.

GNU General Public License
**************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program-to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To "grant"
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

 If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

 The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

 If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

 If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

 If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

Option Index
************

GCC's command line options are indexed here without any initial '-' or
'--'.  Where an option has both positive and negative forms (such as
'-fOPTION' and '-fno-OPTION'), relevant entries in the manual are
indexed under the most appropriate form; it may sometimes be useful to
look up both forms.

1 Installing GCC
****************

The latest version of this document is always available at
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/.  It refers to the current development
sources, instructions for specific released versions are included with
the sources.

   This document describes the generic installation procedure for GCC as
well as detailing some target specific installation instructions.

   GCC includes several components that previously were separate
distributions with their own installation instructions.  This document
supersedes all package-specific installation instructions.

   _Before_ starting the build/install procedure please check the *note
host/target specific installation notes: Specific.  We recommend you
browse the entire generic installation instructions before you proceed.

   Lists of successful builds for released versions of GCC are available
at <http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html>.  These lists are updated as new
information becomes available.

   The installation procedure itself is broken into five steps.

* Menu:

* Prerequisites::
* Downloading the source::
* Configuration::
* Building::
* Testing:: (optional)
* Final install::

   Please note that GCC does not support 'make uninstall' and probably
won't do so in the near future as this would open a can of worms.
Instead, we suggest that you install GCC into a directory of its own and
simply remove that directory when you do not need that specific version
of GCC any longer, and, if shared libraries are installed there as well,
no more binaries exist that use them.

2 Prerequisites
***************

GCC requires that various tools and packages be available for use in the
build procedure.  Modifying GCC sources requires additional tools
described below.

Tools/packages necessary for building GCC
=========================================

ISO C++98 compiler
     Necessary to bootstrap GCC, although versions of GCC prior to 4.8
     also allow bootstrapping with a ISO C89 compiler and versions of
     GCC prior to 3.4 also allow bootstrapping with a traditional (K&R)
     C compiler.

     To build all languages in a cross-compiler or other configuration
     where 3-stage bootstrap is not performed, you need to start with an
     existing GCC binary (version 3.4 or later) because source code for
     language frontends other than C might use GCC extensions.

     Note that to bootstrap GCC with versions of GCC earlier than 3.4,
     you may need to use '--disable-stage1-checking', though
     bootstrapping the compiler with such earlier compilers is strongly
     discouraged.

C standard library and headers

     In order to build GCC, the C standard library and headers must be
     present for all target variants for which target libraries will be
     built (and not only the variant of the host C++ compiler).

     This affects the popular 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu' platform (among
     other multilib targets), for which 64-bit ('x86_64') and 32-bit
     ('i386') libc headers are usually packaged separately.  If you do a
     build of a native compiler on 'x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu', make sure
     you either have the 32-bit libc developer package properly
     installed (the exact name of the package depends on your distro) or
     you must build GCC as a 64-bit only compiler by configuring with
     the option '--disable-multilib'.  Otherwise, you may encounter an
     error such as 'fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file'

GNAT

     In order to build the Ada compiler (GNAT) you must already have
     GNAT installed because portions of the Ada frontend are written in
     Ada (with GNAT extensions.)  Refer to the Ada installation
     instructions for more specific information.

A "working" POSIX compatible shell, or GNU bash

     Necessary when running 'configure' because some '/bin/sh' shells
     have bugs and may crash when configuring the target libraries.  In
     other cases, '/bin/sh' or 'ksh' have disastrous corner-case
     performance problems.  This can cause target 'configure' runs to
     literally take days to complete in some cases.

     So on some platforms '/bin/ksh' is sufficient, on others it isn't.
     See the host/target specific instructions for your platform, or use
     'bash' to be sure.  Then set 'CONFIG_SHELL' in your environment to
     your "good" shell prior to running 'configure'/'make'.

     'zsh' is not a fully compliant POSIX shell and will not work when
     configuring GCC.

A POSIX or SVR4 awk

     Necessary for creating some of the generated source files for GCC.
     If in doubt, use a recent GNU awk version, as some of the older
     ones are broken.  GNU awk version 3.1.5 is known to work.

GNU binutils

     Necessary in some circumstances, optional in others.  See the
     host/target specific instructions for your platform for the exact
     requirements.

gzip version 1.2.4 (or later) or
bzip2 version 1.0.2 (or later)

     Necessary to uncompress GCC 'tar' files when source code is
     obtained via FTP mirror sites.

GNU make version 3.80 (or later)

     You must have GNU make installed to build GCC.

GNU tar version 1.14 (or later)

     Necessary (only on some platforms) to untar the source code.  Many
     systems' 'tar' programs will also work, only try GNU 'tar' if you
     have problems.

Perl version 5.6.1 (or later)

     Necessary when targeting Darwin, building 'libstdc++', and not
     using '--disable-symvers'.  Necessary when targeting Solaris 2 with
     Sun 'ld' and not using '--disable-symvers'.  The bundled 'perl' in
     Solaris 8 and up works.

     Necessary when regenerating 'Makefile' dependencies in libiberty.
     Necessary when regenerating 'libiberty/functions.texi'.  Necessary
     when generating manpages from Texinfo manuals.  Used by various
     scripts to generate some files included in SVN (mainly
     Unicode-related and rarely changing) from source tables.

'jar', or InfoZIP ('zip' and 'unzip')

     Necessary to build libgcj, the GCJ runtime.

   Several support libraries are necessary to build GCC, some are
required, others optional.  While any sufficiently new version of
required tools usually work, library requirements are generally
stricter.  Newer versions may work in some cases, but it's safer to use
the exact versions documented.  We appreciate bug reports about problems
with newer versions, though.  If your OS vendor provides packages for
the support libraries then using those packages may be the simplest way
to install the libraries.

GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later)

     Necessary to build GCC.  If a GMP source distribution is found in a
     subdirectory of your GCC sources named 'gmp', it will be built
     together with GCC. Alternatively, if GMP is already installed but
     it is not in your library search path, you will have to configure
     with the '--with-gmp' configure option.  See also '--with-gmp-lib'
     and '--with-gmp-include'.

MPFR Library version 2.4.2 (or later)

     Necessary to build GCC.  It can be downloaded from
     <http://www.mpfr.org/>.  If an MPFR source distribution is found in
     a subdirectory of your GCC sources named 'mpfr', it will be built
     together with GCC. Alternatively, if MPFR is already installed but
     it is not in your default library search path, the '--with-mpfr'
     configure option should be used.  See also '--with-mpfr-lib' and
     '--with-mpfr-include'.

MPC Library version 0.8.1 (or later)

     Necessary to build GCC.  It can be downloaded from
     <http://www.multiprecision.org/>.  If an MPC source distribution is
     found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named 'mpc', it will be
     built together with GCC. Alternatively, if MPC is already installed
     but it is not in your default library search path, the '--with-mpc'
     configure option should be used.  See also '--with-mpc-lib' and
     '--with-mpc-include'.

ISL Library version 0.12.2

     Necessary to build GCC with the Graphite loop optimizations.  It
     can be downloaded from <ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/>
     as 'isl-0.12.2.tar.bz2'.  If an ISL source distribution is found in
     a subdirectory of your GCC sources named 'isl', it will be built
     together with GCC. Alternatively, the '--with-isl' configure option
     should be used if ISL is not installed in your default library
     search path.

CLooG 0.18.1

     Necessary to build GCC with the Graphite loop optimizations.  It
     can be downloaded from <ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/>
     as 'cloog-0.18.1.tar.gz'.  If a CLooG source distribution is found
     in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named 'cloog', it will be
     built together with GCC. Alternatively, the '--with-cloog'
     configure option should be used if CLooG is not installed in your
     default library search path.

     If you want to install CLooG separately it needs to be built
     against ISL 0.12.2 by using the '--with-isl=system' to direct CLooG
     to pick up an already installed ISL. Using the ISL library as
     bundled with CLooG is not supported.

Tools/packages necessary for modifying GCC
==========================================

autoconf version 2.64
GNU m4 version 1.4.6 (or later)

     Necessary when modifying 'configure.ac', 'aclocal.m4', etc. to
     regenerate 'configure' and 'config.in' files.

automake version 1.11.1

     Necessary when modifying a 'Makefile.am' file to regenerate its
     associated 'Makefile.in'.

     Much of GCC does not use automake, so directly edit the
     'Makefile.in' file.  Specifically this applies to the 'gcc',
     'intl', 'libcpp', 'libiberty', 'libobjc' directories as well as any
     of their subdirectories.

     For directories that use automake, GCC requires the latest release
     in the 1.11 series, which is currently 1.11.1.  When regenerating a
     directory to a newer version, please update all the directories
     using an older 1.11 to the latest released version.

gettext version 0.14.5 (or later)

     Needed to regenerate 'gcc.pot'.

gperf version 2.7.2 (or later)

     Necessary when modifying 'gperf' input files, e.g.
     'gcc/cp/cfns.gperf' to regenerate its associated header file, e.g.
     'gcc/cp/cfns.h'.

DejaGnu 1.4.4
Expect
Tcl

     Necessary to run the GCC testsuite; see the section on testing for
     details.  Tcl 8.6 has a known regression in RE pattern handling
     that make parts of the testsuite fail.  See
     <http://core.tcl.tk/tcl/tktview/267b7e2334ee2e9de34c4b00d6e72e2f1997085f>
     for more information.

autogen version 5.5.4 (or later) and
guile version 1.4.1 (or later)

     Necessary to regenerate 'fixinc/fixincl.x' from
     'fixinc/inclhack.def' and 'fixinc/*.tpl'.

     Necessary to run 'make check' for 'fixinc'.

     Necessary to regenerate the top level 'Makefile.in' file from
     'Makefile.tpl' and 'Makefile.def'.

Flex version 2.5.4 (or later)

     Necessary when modifying '*.l' files.

     Necessary to build GCC during development because the generated
     output files are not included in the SVN repository.  They are
     included in releases.

Texinfo version 4.7 (or later)

     Necessary for running 'makeinfo' when modifying '*.texi' files to
     test your changes.

     Necessary for running 'make dvi' or 'make pdf' to create printable
     documentation in DVI or PDF format.  Texinfo version 4.8 or later
     is required for 'make pdf'.

     Necessary to build GCC documentation during development because the
     generated output files are not included in the SVN repository.
     They are included in releases.

TeX (any working version)

     Necessary for running 'texi2dvi' and 'texi2pdf', which are used
     when running 'make dvi' or 'make pdf' to create DVI or PDF files,
     respectively.

SVN (any version)
SSH (any version)

     Necessary to access the SVN repository.  Public releases and weekly
     snapshots of the development sources are also available via FTP.

GNU diffutils version 2.7 (or later)

     Useful when submitting patches for the GCC source code.

patch version 2.5.4 (or later)

     Necessary when applying patches, created with 'diff', to one's own
     sources.

ecj1
gjavah

     If you wish to modify '.java' files in libjava, you will need to
     configure with '--enable-java-maintainer-mode', and you will need
     to have executables named 'ecj1' and 'gjavah' in your path.  The
     'ecj1' executable should run the Eclipse Java compiler via the
     GCC-specific entry point.  You can download a suitable jar from
     <ftp://sourceware.org/pub/java/>, or by running the script
     'contrib/download_ecj'.

antlr.jar version 2.7.1 (or later)
antlr binary

     If you wish to build the 'gjdoc' binary in libjava, you will need
     to have an 'antlr.jar' library available.  The library is searched
     for in system locations but can be specified with
     '--with-antlr-jar=' instead.  When configuring with
     '--enable-java-maintainer-mode', you will need to have one of the
     executables named 'cantlr', 'runantlr' or 'antlr' in your path.

3 Downloading GCC
*****************

GCC is distributed via SVN and FTP tarballs compressed with 'gzip' or
'bzip2'.

   Please refer to the releases web page for information on how to
obtain GCC.

   The source distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran,
Java, and Ada (in the case of GCC 3.1 and later) compilers, as well as
runtime libraries for C++, Objective-C, Fortran, and Java.  For previous
versions these were downloadable as separate components such as the core
GCC distribution, which included the C language front end and shared
components, and language-specific distributions including the language
front end and the language runtime (where appropriate).

   If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your OS),
unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or a
separate one.  In the latter case, add symbolic links to any components
of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler ('bfd',
'binutils', 'gas', 'gprof', 'ld', 'opcodes', ...) to the directory
containing the GCC sources.

   Likewise the GMP, MPFR and MPC libraries can be automatically built
together with GCC. Unpack the GMP, MPFR and/or MPC source distributions
in the directory containing the GCC sources and rename their directories
to 'gmp', 'mpfr' and 'mpc', respectively (or use symbolic links with the
same name).

4 Installing GCC: Configuration
*******************************

Like most GNU software, GCC must be configured before it can be built.
This document describes the recommended configuration procedure for both
native and cross targets.

   We use SRCDIR to refer to the toplevel source directory for GCC; we
use OBJDIR to refer to the toplevel build/object directory.

   If you obtained the sources via SVN, SRCDIR must refer to the top
'gcc' directory, the one where the 'MAINTAINERS' file can be found, and
not its 'gcc' subdirectory, otherwise the build will fail.

   If either SRCDIR or OBJDIR is located on an automounted NFS file
system, the shell's built-in 'pwd' command will return temporary
pathnames.  Using these can lead to various sorts of build problems.  To
avoid this issue, set the 'PWDCMD' environment variable to an
automounter-aware 'pwd' command, e.g., 'pawd' or 'amq -w', during the
configuration and build phases.

   First, we *highly* recommend that GCC be built into a separate
directory from the sources which does *not* reside within the source
tree.  This is how we generally build GCC; building where SRCDIR ==
OBJDIR should still work, but doesn't get extensive testing; building
where OBJDIR is a subdirectory of SRCDIR is unsupported.

   If you have previously built GCC in the same directory for a
different target machine, do 'make distclean' to delete all files that
might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is 'Makefile'; if 'make
distclean' complains that 'Makefile' does not exist or issues a message
like "don't know how to make distclean" it probably means that the
directory is already suitably clean.  However, with the recommended
method of building in a separate OBJDIR, you should simply use a
different OBJDIR for each target.

   Second, when configuring a native system, either 'cc' or 'gcc' must
be in your path or you must set 'CC' in your environment before running
configure.  Otherwise the configuration scripts may fail.

   To configure GCC:

     % mkdir OBJDIR
     % cd OBJDIR
     % SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

Distributor options
===================

If you will be distributing binary versions of GCC, with modifications
to the source code, you should use the options described in this section
to make clear that your version contains modifications.

'--with-pkgversion=VERSION'
     Specify a string that identifies your package.  You may wish to
     include a build number or build date.  This version string will be
     included in the output of 'gcc --version'.  This suffix does not
     replace the default version string, only the 'GCC' part.

     The default value is 'GCC'.

'--with-bugurl=URL'
     Specify the URL that users should visit if they wish to report a
     bug.  You are of course welcome to forward bugs reported to you to
     the FSF, if you determine that they are not bugs in your
     modifications.

     The default value refers to the FSF's GCC bug tracker.

Target specification
====================

   * GCC has code to correctly determine the correct value for TARGET
     for nearly all native systems.  Therefore, we highly recommend you
     do not provide a configure target when configuring a native
     compiler.

   * TARGET must be specified as '--target=TARGET' when configuring a
     cross compiler; examples of valid targets would be m68k-elf,
     sh-elf, etc.

   * Specifying just TARGET instead of '--target=TARGET' implies that
     the host defaults to TARGET.

Options specification
=====================

Use OPTIONS to override several configure time options for GCC.  A list
of supported OPTIONS follows; 'configure --help' may list other options,
but those not listed below may not work and should not normally be used.

   Note that each '--enable' option has a corresponding '--disable'
option and that each '--with' option has a corresponding '--without'
option.

'--prefix=DIRNAME'
     Specify the toplevel installation directory.  This is the
     recommended way to install the tools into a directory other than
     the default.  The toplevel installation directory defaults to
     '/usr/local'.

     We *highly* recommend against DIRNAME being the same or a
     subdirectory of OBJDIR or vice versa.  If specifying a directory
     beneath a user's home directory tree, some shells will not expand
     DIRNAME correctly if it contains the '~' metacharacter; use '$HOME'
     instead.

     The following standard 'autoconf' options are supported.  Normally
     you should not need to use these options.
     '--exec-prefix=DIRNAME'
          Specify the toplevel installation directory for
          architecture-dependent files.  The default is 'PREFIX'.

     '--bindir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for the executables called
          by users (such as 'gcc' and 'g++').  The default is
          'EXEC-PREFIX/bin'.

     '--libdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for object code libraries
          and internal data files of GCC.  The default is
          'EXEC-PREFIX/lib'.

     '--libexecdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for internal executables of
          GCC.  The default is 'EXEC-PREFIX/libexec'.

     '--with-slibdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for the shared libgcc
          library.  The default is 'LIBDIR'.

     '--datarootdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the root of the directory tree for read-only
          architecture-independent data files referenced by GCC.  The
          default is 'PREFIX/share'.

     '--infodir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for documentation in info
          format.  The default is 'DATAROOTDIR/info'.

     '--datadir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for some
          architecture-independent data files referenced by GCC.  The
          default is 'DATAROOTDIR'.

     '--docdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for documentation files
          (other than Info) for GCC.  The default is 'DATAROOTDIR/doc'.

     '--htmldir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for HTML documentation
          files.  The default is 'DOCDIR'.

     '--pdfdir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for PDF documentation
          files.  The default is 'DOCDIR'.

     '--mandir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for manual pages.  The
          default is 'DATAROOTDIR/man'.  (Note that the manual pages are
          only extracts from the full GCC manuals, which are provided in
          Texinfo format.  The manpages are derived by an automatic
          conversion process from parts of the full manual.)

     '--with-gxx-include-dir=DIRNAME'
          Specify the installation directory for G++ header files.  The
          default depends on other configuration options, and differs
          between cross and native configurations.

     '--with-specs=SPECS'
          Specify additional command line driver SPECS. This can be
          useful if you need to turn on a non-standard feature by
          default without modifying the compiler's source code, for
          instance
          '--with-specs=%{!fcommon:%{!fno-common:-fno-common}}'.  *Note
          Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them:
          (gcc)Spec Files,

'--program-prefix=PREFIX'
     GCC supports some transformations of the names of its programs when
     installing them.  This option prepends PREFIX to the names of
     programs to install in BINDIR (see above).  For example, specifying
     '--program-prefix=foo-' would result in 'gcc' being installed as
     '/usr/local/bin/foo-gcc'.

'--program-suffix=SUFFIX'
     Appends SUFFIX to the names of programs to install in BINDIR (see
     above).  For example, specifying '--program-suffix=-3.1' would
     result in 'gcc' being installed as '/usr/local/bin/gcc-3.1'.

'--program-transform-name=PATTERN'
     Applies the 'sed' script PATTERN to be applied to the names of
     programs to install in BINDIR (see above).  PATTERN has to consist
     of one or more basic 'sed' editing commands, separated by
     semicolons.  For example, if you want the 'gcc' program name to be
     transformed to the installed program '/usr/local/bin/myowngcc' and
     the 'g++' program name to be transformed to
     '/usr/local/bin/gspecial++' without changing other program names,
     you could use the pattern
     '--program-transform-name='s/^gcc$/myowngcc/; s/^g++$/gspecial++/''
     to achieve this effect.

     All three options can be combined and used together, resulting in
     more complex conversion patterns.  As a basic rule, PREFIX (and
     SUFFIX) are prepended (appended) before further transformations can
     happen with a special transformation script PATTERN.

     As currently implemented, this option only takes effect for native
     builds; cross compiler binaries' names are not transformed even
     when a transformation is explicitly asked for by one of these
     options.

     For native builds, some of the installed programs are also
     installed with the target alias in front of their name, as in
     'i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc'.  All of the above transformations happen
     before the target alias is prepended to the name--so, specifying
     '--program-prefix=foo-' and 'program-suffix=-3.1', the resulting
     binary would be installed as
     '/usr/local/bin/i686-pc-linux-gnu-foo-gcc-3.1'.

     As a last shortcoming, none of the installed Ada programs are
     transformed yet, which will be fixed in some time.

'--with-local-prefix=DIRNAME'
     Specify the installation directory for local include files.  The
     default is '/usr/local'.  Specify this option if you want the
     compiler to search directory 'DIRNAME/include' for locally
     installed header files _instead_ of '/usr/local/include'.

     You should specify '--with-local-prefix' *only* if your site has a
     different convention (not '/usr/local') for where to put
     site-specific files.

     The default value for '--with-local-prefix' is '/usr/local'
     regardless of the value of '--prefix'.  Specifying '--prefix' has
     no effect on which directory GCC searches for local header files.
     This may seem counterintuitive, but actually it is logical.

     The purpose of '--prefix' is to specify where to _install GCC_. The
     local header files in '/usr/local/include'--if you put any in that
     directory--are not part of GCC.  They are part of other
     programs--perhaps many others.  (GCC installs its own header files
     in another directory which is based on the '--prefix' value.)

     Both the local-prefix include directory and the GCC-prefix include
     directory are part of GCC's "system include" directories.  Although
     these two directories are not fixed, they need to be searched in
     the proper order for the correct processing of the include_next
     directive.  The local-prefix include directory is searched before
     the GCC-prefix include directory.  Another characteristic of system
     include directories is that pedantic warnings are turned off for
     headers in these directories.

     Some autoconf macros add '-I DIRECTORY' options to the compiler
     command line, to ensure that directories containing installed
     packages' headers are searched.  When DIRECTORY is one of GCC's
     system include directories, GCC will ignore the option so that
     system directories continue to be processed in the correct order.
     This may result in a search order different from what was specified
     but the directory will still be searched.

     GCC automatically searches for ordinary libraries using
     'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  Thus, when the same installation prefix is used
     for both GCC and packages, GCC will automatically search for both
     headers and libraries.  This provides a configuration that is easy
     to use.  GCC behaves in a manner similar to that when it is
     installed as a system compiler in '/usr'.

     Sites that need to install multiple versions of GCC may not want to
     use the above simple configuration.  It is possible to use the
     '--program-prefix', '--program-suffix' and
     '--program-transform-name' options to install multiple versions
     into a single directory, but it may be simpler to use different
     prefixes and the '--with-local-prefix' option to specify the
     location of the site-specific files for each version.  It will then
     be necessary for users to specify explicitly the location of local
     site libraries (e.g., with 'LIBRARY_PATH').

     The same value can be used for both '--with-local-prefix' and
     '--prefix' provided it is not '/usr'.  This can be used to avoid
     the default search of '/usr/local/include'.

     *Do not* specify '/usr' as the '--with-local-prefix'!  The
     directory you use for '--with-local-prefix' *must not* contain any
     of the system's standard header files.  If it did contain them,
     certain programs would be miscompiled (including GNU Emacs, on
     certain targets), because this would override and nullify the
     header file corrections made by the 'fixincludes' script.

     Indications are that people who use this option use it based on
     mistaken ideas of what it is for.  People use it as if it specified
     where to install part of GCC.  Perhaps they make this assumption
     because installing GCC creates the directory.

'--with-native-system-header-dir=DIRNAME'
     Specifies that DIRNAME is the directory that contains native system
     header files, rather than '/usr/include'.  This option is most
     useful if you are creating a compiler that should be isolated from
     the system as much as possible.  It is most commonly used with the
     '--with-sysroot' option and will cause GCC to search DIRNAME inside
     the system root specified by that option.

'--enable-shared[=PACKAGE[,...]]'
     Build shared versions of libraries, if shared libraries are
     supported on the target platform.  Unlike GCC 2.95.x and earlier,
     shared libraries are enabled by default on all platforms that
     support shared libraries.

     If a list of packages is given as an argument, build shared
     libraries only for the listed packages.  For other packages, only
     static libraries will be built.  Package names currently recognized
     in the GCC tree are 'libgcc' (also known as 'gcc'), 'libstdc++'
     (not 'libstdc++-v3'), 'libffi', 'zlib', 'boehm-gc', 'ada',
     'libada', 'libjava', 'libgo', and 'libobjc'.  Note 'libiberty' does
     not support shared libraries at all.

     Use '--disable-shared' to build only static libraries.  Note that
     '--disable-shared' does not accept a list of package names as
     argument, only '--enable-shared' does.

     Contrast with '--enable-host-shared', which affects _host_ code.

'--enable-host-shared'
     Specify that the _host_ code should be built into
     position-independent machine code (with -fPIC), allowing it to be
     used within shared libraries, but yielding a slightly slower
     compiler.

     Currently this option is only of use to people developing GCC
     itself.

     Contrast with '--enable-shared', which affects _target_ libraries.

'--with-gnu-as'
     Specify that the compiler should assume that the assembler it finds
     is the GNU assembler.  However, this does not modify the rules to
     find an assembler and will result in confusion if the assembler
     found is not actually the GNU assembler.  (Confusion may also
     result if the compiler finds the GNU assembler but has not been
     configured with '--with-gnu-as'.)  If you have more than one
     assembler installed on your system, you may want to use this option
     in connection with '--with-as=PATHNAME' or
     '--with-build-time-tools=PATHNAME'.

     The following systems are the only ones where it makes a difference
     whether you use the GNU assembler.  On any other system,
     '--with-gnu-as' has no effect.

        * 'hppa1.0-ANY-ANY'
        * 'hppa1.1-ANY-ANY'
        * 'sparc-sun-solaris2.ANY'
        * 'sparc64-ANY-solaris2.ANY'

'--with-as=PATHNAME'
     Specify that the compiler should use the assembler pointed to by
     PATHNAME, rather than the one found by the standard rules to find
     an assembler, which are:
        * Unless GCC is being built with a cross compiler, check the
          'LIBEXEC/gcc/TARGET/VERSION' directory.  LIBEXEC defaults to
          'EXEC-PREFIX/libexec'; EXEC-PREFIX defaults to PREFIX, which
          defaults to '/usr/local' unless overridden by the
          '--prefix=PATHNAME' switch described above.  TARGET is the
          target system triple, such as 'sparc-sun-solaris2.7', and
          VERSION denotes the GCC version, such as 3.0.

        * If the target system is the same that you are building on,
          check operating system specific directories (e.g.
          '/usr/ccs/bin' on Sun Solaris 2).

        * Check in the 'PATH' for a tool whose name is prefixed by the
          target system triple.

        * Check in the 'PATH' for a tool whose name is not prefixed by
          the target system triple, if the host and target system triple
          are the same (in other words, we use a host tool if it can be
          used for the target as well).

     You may want to use '--with-as' if no assembler is installed in the
     directories listed above, or if you have multiple assemblers
     installed and want to choose one that is not found by the above
     rules.

'--with-gnu-ld'
     Same as '--with-gnu-as' but for the linker.

'--with-ld=PATHNAME'
     Same as '--with-as' but for the linker.

'--with-stabs'
     Specify that stabs debugging information should be used instead of
     whatever format the host normally uses.  Normally GCC uses the same
     debug format as the host system.

     On MIPS based systems and on Alphas, you must specify whether you
     want GCC to create the normal ECOFF debugging format, or to use
     BSD-style stabs passed through the ECOFF symbol table.  The normal
     ECOFF debug format cannot fully handle languages other than C.  BSD
     stabs format can handle other languages, but it only works with the
     GNU debugger GDB.

     Normally, GCC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default; if you
     prefer BSD stabs, specify '--with-stabs' when you configure GCC.

     No matter which default you choose when you configure GCC, the user
     can use the '-gcoff' and '-gstabs+' options to specify explicitly
     the debug format for a particular compilation.

     '--with-stabs' is meaningful on the ISC system on the 386, also, if
     '--with-gas' is used.  It selects use of stabs debugging
     information embedded in COFF output.  This kind of debugging
     information supports C++ well; ordinary COFF debugging information
     does not.

     '--with-stabs' is also meaningful on 386 systems running SVR4.  It
     selects use of stabs debugging information embedded in ELF output.
     The C++ compiler currently (2.6.0) does not support the DWARF
     debugging information normally used on 386 SVR4 platforms; stabs
     provide a workable alternative.  This requires gas and gdb, as the
     normal SVR4 tools can not generate or interpret stabs.

'--with-tls=DIALECT'
     Specify the default TLS dialect, for systems were there is a
     choice.  For ARM targets, possible values for DIALECT are 'gnu' or
     'gnu2', which select between the original GNU dialect and the GNU
     TLS descriptor-based dialect.

'--enable-multiarch'
     Specify whether to enable or disable multiarch support.  The
     default is to check for glibc start files in a multiarch location,
     and enable it if the files are found.  The auto detection is
     enabled for native builds, and for cross builds configured with
     '--with-sysroot', and without '--with-native-system-header-dir'.
     More documentation about multiarch can be found at
     <http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch>.

'--enable-vtable-verify'
     Specify whether to enable or disable the vtable verification
     feature.  Enabling this feature causes libstdc++ to be built with
     its virtual calls in verifiable mode.  This means that, when linked
     with libvtv, every virtual call in libstdc++ will verify the vtable
     pointer through which the call will be made before actually making
     the call.  If not linked with libvtv, the verifier will call stub
     functions (in libstdc++ itself) and do nothing.  If vtable
     verification is disabled, then libstdc++ is not built with its
     virtual calls in verifiable mode at all.  However the libvtv
     library will still be built (see '--disable-libvtv' to turn off
     building libvtv).  '--disable-vtable-verify' is the default.

'--disable-multilib'
     Specify that multiple target libraries to support different target
     variants, calling conventions, etc. should not be built.  The
     default is to build a predefined set of them.

     Some targets provide finer-grained control over which multilibs are
     built (e.g., '--disable-softfloat'):
     'arm-*-*'
          fpu, 26bit, underscore, interwork, biendian, nofmult.

     'm68*-*-*'
          softfloat, m68881, m68000, m68020.

     'mips*-*-*'
          single-float, biendian, softfloat.

     'powerpc*-*-*, rs6000*-*-*'
          aix64, pthread, softfloat, powercpu, powerpccpu, powerpcos,
          biendian, sysv, aix.

'--with-multilib-list=LIST'
'--without-multilib-list'
     Specify what multilibs to build.  Currently only implemented for
     sh*-*-* and x86-64-*-linux*.

     'sh*-*-*'
          LIST is a comma separated list of CPU names.  These must be of
          the form 'sh*' or 'm*' (in which case they match the compiler
          option for that processor).  The list should not contain any
          endian options - these are handled by '--with-endian'.

          If LIST is empty, then there will be no multilibs for extra
          processors.  The multilib for the secondary endian remains
          enabled.

          As a special case, if an entry in the list starts with a '!'
          (exclamation point), then it is added to the list of excluded
          multilibs.  Entries of this sort should be compatible with
          'MULTILIB_EXCLUDES' (once the leading '!' has been stripped).

          If '--with-multilib-list' is not given, then a default set of
          multilibs is selected based on the value of '--target'.  This
          is usually the complete set of libraries, but some targets
          imply a more specialized subset.

          Example 1: to configure a compiler for SH4A only, but
          supporting both endians, with little endian being the default:
               --with-cpu=sh4a --with-endian=little,big --with-multilib-list=

          Example 2: to configure a compiler for both SH4A and
          SH4AL-DSP, but with only little endian SH4AL:
               --with-cpu=sh4a --with-endian=little,big \
               --with-multilib-list=sh4al,!mb/m4al

     'x86-64-*-linux*'
          LIST is a comma separated list of 'm32', 'm64' and 'mx32' to
          enable 32-bit, 64-bit and x32 run-time libraries,
          respectively.  If LIST is empty, then there will be no
          multilibs and only the default run-time library will be
          enabled.

          If '--with-multilib-list' is not given, then only 32-bit and
          64-bit run-time libraries will be enabled.

'--with-endian=ENDIANS'
     Specify what endians to use.  Currently only implemented for
     sh*-*-*.

     ENDIANS may be one of the following:
     'big'
          Use big endian exclusively.
     'little'
          Use little endian exclusively.
     'big,little'
          Use big endian by default.  Provide a multilib for little
          endian.
     'little,big'
          Use little endian by default.  Provide a multilib for big
          endian.

'--enable-threads'
     Specify that the target supports threads.  This affects the
     Objective-C compiler and runtime library, and exception handling
     for other languages like C++ and Java.  On some systems, this is
     the default.

     In general, the best (and, in many cases, the only known) threading
     model available will be configured for use.  Beware that on some
     systems, GCC has not been taught what threading models are
     generally available for the system.  In this case,
     '--enable-threads' is an alias for '--enable-threads=single'.

'--disable-threads'
     Specify that threading support should be disabled for the system.
     This is an alias for '--enable-threads=single'.

'--enable-threads=LIB'
     Specify that LIB is the thread support library.  This affects the
     Objective-C compiler and runtime library, and exception handling
     for other languages like C++ and Java.  The possibilities for LIB
     are:

     'aix'
          AIX thread support.
     'dce'
          DCE thread support.
     'lynx'
          LynxOS thread support.
     'mipssde'
          MIPS SDE thread support.
     'no'
          This is an alias for 'single'.
     'posix'
          Generic POSIX/Unix98 thread support.
     'rtems'
          RTEMS thread support.
     'single'
          Disable thread support, should work for all platforms.
     'tpf'
          TPF thread support.
     'vxworks'
          VxWorks thread support.
     'win32'
          Microsoft Win32 API thread support.

'--enable-tls'
     Specify that the target supports TLS (Thread Local Storage).
     Usually configure can correctly determine if TLS is supported.  In
     cases where it guesses incorrectly, TLS can be explicitly enabled
     or disabled with '--enable-tls' or '--disable-tls'.  This can
     happen if the assembler supports TLS but the C library does not, or
     if the assumptions made by the configure test are incorrect.

'--disable-tls'
     Specify that the target does not support TLS. This is an alias for
     '--enable-tls=no'.

'--with-cpu=CPU'
'--with-cpu-32=CPU'
'--with-cpu-64=CPU'
     Specify which cpu variant the compiler should generate code for by
     default.  CPU will be used as the default value of the '-mcpu='
     switch.  This option is only supported on some targets, including
     ARC, ARM, i386, M68k, PowerPC, and SPARC.  It is mandatory for ARC.
     The '--with-cpu-32' and '--with-cpu-64' options specify separate
     default CPUs for 32-bit and 64-bit modes; these options are only
     supported for i386, x86-64 and PowerPC.

'--with-schedule=CPU'
'--with-arch=CPU'
'--with-arch-32=CPU'
'--with-arch-64=CPU'
'--with-tune=CPU'
'--with-tune-32=CPU'
'--with-tune-64=CPU'
'--with-abi=ABI'
'--with-fpu=TYPE'
'--with-float=TYPE'
     These configure options provide default values for the
     '-mschedule=', '-march=', '-mtune=', '-mabi=', and '-mfpu=' options
     and for '-mhard-float' or '-msoft-float'.  As with '--with-cpu',
     which switches will be accepted and acceptable values of the
     arguments depend on the target.

'--with-mode=MODE'
     Specify if the compiler should default to '-marm' or '-mthumb'.
     This option is only supported on ARM targets.

'--with-stack-offset=NUM'
     This option sets the default for the -mstack-offset=NUM option, and
     will thus generally also control the setting of this option for
     libraries.  This option is only supported on Epiphany targets.

'--with-fpmath=ISA'
     This options sets '-mfpmath=sse' by default and specifies the
     default ISA for floating-point arithmetics.  You can select either
     'sse' which enables '-msse2' or 'avx' which enables '-mavx' by
     default.  This option is only supported on i386 and x86-64 targets.

'--with-nan=ENCODING'
     On MIPS targets, set the default encoding convention to use for the
     special not-a-number (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data.  The
     possibilities for ENCODING are:
     'legacy'
          Use the legacy encoding, as with the '-mnan=legacy'
          command-line option.
     '2008'
          Use the 754-2008 encoding, as with the '-mnan=2008'
          command-line option.
     To use this configuration option you must have an assembler version
     installed that supports the '-mnan=' command-line option too.  In
     the absence of this configuration option the default convention is
     the legacy encoding, as when neither of the '-mnan=2008' and
     '-mnan=legacy' command-line options has been used.

'--with-divide=TYPE'
     Specify how the compiler should generate code for checking for
     division by zero.  This option is only supported on the MIPS
     target.  The possibilities for TYPE are:
     'traps'
          Division by zero checks use conditional traps (this is the
          default on systems that support conditional traps).
     'breaks'
          Division by zero checks use the break instruction.

'--with-llsc'
     On MIPS targets, make '-mllsc' the default when no '-mno-llsc'
     option is passed.  This is the default for Linux-based targets, as
     the kernel will emulate them if the ISA does not provide them.

'--without-llsc'
     On MIPS targets, make '-mno-llsc' the default when no '-mllsc'
     option is passed.

'--with-synci'
     On MIPS targets, make '-msynci' the default when no '-mno-synci'
     option is passed.

'--without-synci'
     On MIPS targets, make '-mno-synci' the default when no '-msynci'
     option is passed.  This is the default.

'--with-mips-plt'
     On MIPS targets, make use of copy relocations and PLTs.  These
     features are extensions to the traditional SVR4-based MIPS ABIs and
     require support from GNU binutils and the runtime C library.

'--enable-__cxa_atexit'
     Define if you want to use __cxa_atexit, rather than atexit, to
     register C++ destructors for local statics and global objects.
     This is essential for fully standards-compliant handling of
     destructors, but requires __cxa_atexit in libc.  This option is
     currently only available on systems with GNU libc.  When enabled,
     this will cause '-fuse-cxa-atexit' to be passed by default.

'--enable-gnu-indirect-function'
     Define if you want to enable the 'ifunc' attribute.  This option is
     currently only available on systems with GNU libc on certain
     targets.

'--enable-target-optspace'
     Specify that target libraries should be optimized for code space
     instead of code speed.  This is the default for the m32r platform.

'--with-cpp-install-dir=DIRNAME'
     Specify that the user visible 'cpp' program should be installed in
     'PREFIX/DIRNAME/cpp', in addition to BINDIR.

'--enable-comdat'
     Enable COMDAT group support.  This is primarily used to override
     the automatically detected value.

'--enable-initfini-array'
     Force the use of sections '.init_array' and '.fini_array' (instead
     of '.init' and '.fini') for constructors and destructors.  Option
     '--disable-initfini-array' has the opposite effect.  If neither
     option is specified, the configure script will try to guess whether
     the '.init_array' and '.fini_array' sections are supported and, if
     they are, use them.

'--enable-link-mutex'
     When building GCC, use a mutex to avoid linking the compilers for
     multiple languages at the same time, to avoid thrashing on build
     systems with limited free memory.  The default is not to use such a
     mutex.

'--enable-maintainer-mode'
     The build rules that regenerate the Autoconf and Automake output
     files as well as the GCC master message catalog 'gcc.pot' are
     normally disabled.  This is because it can only be rebuilt if the
     complete source tree is present.  If you have changed the sources
     and want to rebuild the catalog, configuring with
     '--enable-maintainer-mode' will enable this.  Note that you need a
     recent version of the 'gettext' tools to do so.

'--disable-bootstrap'
     For a native build, the default configuration is to perform a
     3-stage bootstrap of the compiler when 'make' is invoked, testing
     that GCC can compile itself correctly.  If you want to disable this
     process, you can configure with '--disable-bootstrap'.

'--enable-bootstrap'
     In special cases, you may want to perform a 3-stage build even if
     the target and host triplets are different.  This is possible when
     the host can run code compiled for the target (e.g. host is
     i686-linux, target is i486-linux).  Starting from GCC 4.2, to do
     this you have to configure explicitly with '--enable-bootstrap'.

'--enable-generated-files-in-srcdir'
     Neither the .c and .h files that are generated from Bison and flex
     nor the info manuals and man pages that are built from the .texi
     files are present in the SVN development tree.  When building GCC
     from that development tree, or from one of our snapshots, those
     generated files are placed in your build directory, which allows
     for the source to be in a readonly directory.

     If you configure with '--enable-generated-files-in-srcdir' then
     those generated files will go into the source directory.  This is
     mainly intended for generating release or prerelease tarballs of
     the GCC sources, since it is not a requirement that the users of
     source releases to have flex, Bison, or makeinfo.

'--enable-version-specific-runtime-libs'
     Specify that runtime libraries should be installed in the compiler
     specific subdirectory ('LIBDIR/gcc') rather than the usual places.
     In addition, 'libstdc++''s include files will be installed into
     'LIBDIR' unless you overruled it by using
     '--with-gxx-include-dir=DIRNAME'.  Using this option is
     particularly useful if you intend to use several versions of GCC in
     parallel.  This is currently supported by 'libgfortran', 'libjava',
     'libstdc++', and 'libobjc'.

'--enable-languages=LANG1,LANG2,...'
     Specify that only a particular subset of compilers and their
     runtime libraries should be built.  For a list of valid values for
     LANGN you can issue the following command in the 'gcc' directory of
     your GCC source tree:
          grep language= */config-lang.in
     Currently, you can use any of the following: 'all', 'ada', 'c',
     'c++', 'fortran', 'go', 'java', 'objc', 'obj-c++'.  Building the
     Ada compiler has special requirements, see below.  If you do not
     pass this flag, or specify the option 'all', then all default
     languages available in the 'gcc' sub-tree will be configured.  Ada,
     Go and Objective-C++ are not default languages; the rest are.

'--enable-stage1-languages=LANG1,LANG2,...'
     Specify that a particular subset of compilers and their runtime
     libraries should be built with the system C compiler during stage 1
     of the bootstrap process, rather than only in later stages with the
     bootstrapped C compiler.  The list of valid values is the same as
     for '--enable-languages', and the option 'all' will select all of
     the languages enabled by '--enable-languages'.  This option is
     primarily useful for GCC development; for instance, when a
     development version of the compiler cannot bootstrap due to
     compiler bugs, or when one is debugging front ends other than the C
     front end.  When this option is used, one can then build the target
     libraries for the specified languages with the stage-1 compiler by
     using 'make stage1-bubble all-target', or run the testsuite on the
     stage-1 compiler for the specified languages using 'make
     stage1-start check-gcc'.

'--disable-libada'
     Specify that the run-time libraries and tools used by GNAT should
     not be built.  This can be useful for debugging, or for
     compatibility with previous Ada build procedures, when it was
     required to explicitly do a 'make -C gcc gnatlib_and_tools'.

'--disable-libsanitizer'
     Specify that the run-time libraries for the various sanitizers
     should not be built.

'--disable-libssp'
     Specify that the run-time libraries for stack smashing protection
     should not be built.

'--disable-libquadmath'
     Specify that the GCC quad-precision math library should not be
     built.  On some systems, the library is required to be linkable
     when building the Fortran front end, unless
     '--disable-libquadmath-support' is used.

'--disable-libquadmath-support'
     Specify that the Fortran front end and 'libgfortran' do not add
     support for 'libquadmath' on systems supporting it.

'--disable-libgomp'
     Specify that the run-time libraries used by GOMP should not be
     built.

'--disable-libvtv'
     Specify that the run-time libraries used by vtable verification
     should not be built.

'--with-dwarf2'
     Specify that the compiler should use DWARF 2 debugging information
     as the default.

'--enable-targets=all'
'--enable-targets=TARGET_LIST'
     Some GCC targets, e.g. powerpc64-linux, build bi-arch compilers.
     These are compilers that are able to generate either 64-bit or
     32-bit code.  Typically, the corresponding 32-bit target, e.g.
     powerpc-linux for powerpc64-linux, only generates 32-bit code.
     This option enables the 32-bit target to be a bi-arch compiler,
     which is useful when you want a bi-arch compiler that defaults to
     32-bit, and you are building a bi-arch or multi-arch binutils in a
     combined tree.  On mips-linux, this will build a tri-arch compiler
     (ABI o32/n32/64), defaulted to o32.  Currently, this option only
     affects sparc-linux, powerpc-linux, x86-linux, mips-linux and
     s390-linux.

'--enable-secureplt'
     This option enables '-msecure-plt' by default for powerpc-linux.
     *Note RS/6000 and PowerPC Options: (gcc)RS/6000 and PowerPC
     Options,

'--enable-cld'
     This option enables '-mcld' by default for 32-bit x86 targets.
     *Note i386 and x86-64 Options: (gcc)i386 and x86-64 Options,

'--enable-win32-registry'
'--enable-win32-registry=KEY'
'--disable-win32-registry'
     The '--enable-win32-registry' option enables Microsoft
     Windows-hosted GCC to look up installations paths in the registry
     using the following key:

          HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Free Software Foundation\KEY

     KEY defaults to GCC version number, and can be overridden by the
     '--enable-win32-registry=KEY' option.  Vendors and distributors who
     use custom installers are encouraged to provide a different key,
     perhaps one comprised of vendor name and GCC version number, to
     avoid conflict with existing installations.  This feature is
     enabled by default, and can be disabled by
     '--disable-win32-registry' option.  This option has no effect on
     the other hosts.

'--nfp'
     Specify that the machine does not have a floating point unit.  This
     option only applies to 'm68k-sun-sunosN'.  On any other system,
     '--nfp' has no effect.

'--enable-werror'
'--disable-werror'
'--enable-werror=yes'
'--enable-werror=no'
     When you specify this option, it controls whether certain files in
     the compiler are built with '-Werror' in bootstrap stage2 and
     later.  If you don't specify it, '-Werror' is turned on for the
     main development trunk.  However it defaults to off for release
     branches and final releases.  The specific files which get
     '-Werror' are controlled by the Makefiles.

'--enable-checking'
'--enable-checking=LIST'
     When you specify this option, the compiler is built to perform
     internal consistency checks of the requested complexity.  This does
     not change the generated code, but adds error checking within the
     compiler.  This will slow down the compiler and may only work
     properly if you are building the compiler with GCC.  This is 'yes'
     by default when building from SVN or snapshots, but 'release' for
     releases.  The default for building the stage1 compiler is 'yes'.
     More control over the checks may be had by specifying LIST.  The
     categories of checks available are 'yes' (most common checks
     'assert,misc,tree,gc,rtlflag,runtime'), 'no' (no checks at all),
     'all' (all but 'valgrind'), 'release' (cheapest checks
     'assert,runtime') or 'none' (same as 'no').  Individual checks can
     be enabled with these flags 'assert', 'df', 'fold', 'gc', 'gcac'
     'misc', 'rtl', 'rtlflag', 'runtime', 'tree', and 'valgrind'.

     The 'valgrind' check requires the external 'valgrind' simulator,
     available from <http://valgrind.org/>.  The 'df', 'rtl', 'gcac' and
     'valgrind' checks are very expensive.  To disable all checking,
     '--disable-checking' or '--enable-checking=none' must be explicitly
     requested.  Disabling assertions will make the compiler and runtime
     slightly faster but increase the risk of undetected internal errors
     causing wrong code to be generated.

'--disable-stage1-checking'
'--enable-stage1-checking'
'--enable-stage1-checking=LIST'
     If no '--enable-checking' option is specified the stage1 compiler
     will be built with 'yes' checking enabled, otherwise the stage1
     checking flags are the same as specified by '--enable-checking'.
     To build the stage1 compiler with different checking options use
     '--enable-stage1-checking'.  The list of checking options is the
     same as for '--enable-checking'.  If your system is too slow or too
     small to bootstrap a released compiler with checking for stage1
     enabled, you can use '--disable-stage1-checking' to disable
     checking for the stage1 compiler.

'--enable-coverage'
'--enable-coverage=LEVEL'
     With this option, the compiler is built to collect self coverage
     information, every time it is run.  This is for internal
     development purposes, and only works when the compiler is being
     built with gcc.  The LEVEL argument controls whether the compiler
     is built optimized or not, values are 'opt' and 'noopt'.  For
     coverage analysis you want to disable optimization, for performance
     analysis you want to enable optimization.  When coverage is
     enabled, the default level is without optimization.

'--enable-gather-detailed-mem-stats'
     When this option is specified more detailed information on memory
     allocation is gathered.  This information is printed when using
     '-fmem-report'.

'--enable-nls'
'--disable-nls'
     The '--enable-nls' option enables Native Language Support (NLS),
     which lets GCC output diagnostics in languages other than American
     English.  Native Language Support is enabled by default if not
     doing a canadian cross build.  The '--disable-nls' option disables
     NLS.

'--with-included-gettext'
     If NLS is enabled, the '--with-included-gettext' option causes the
     build procedure to prefer its copy of GNU 'gettext'.

'--with-catgets'
     If NLS is enabled, and if the host lacks 'gettext' but has the
     inferior 'catgets' interface, the GCC build procedure normally
     ignores 'catgets' and instead uses GCC's copy of the GNU 'gettext'
     library.  The '--with-catgets' option causes the build procedure to
     use the host's 'catgets' in this situation.

'--with-libiconv-prefix=DIR'
     Search for libiconv header files in 'DIR/include' and libiconv
     library files in 'DIR/lib'.

'--enable-obsolete'
     Enable configuration for an obsoleted system.  If you attempt to
     configure GCC for a system (build, host, or target) which has been
     obsoleted, and you do not specify this flag, configure will halt
     with an error message.

     All support for systems which have been obsoleted in one release of
     GCC is removed entirely in the next major release, unless someone
     steps forward to maintain the port.

'--enable-decimal-float'
'--enable-decimal-float=yes'
'--enable-decimal-float=no'
'--enable-decimal-float=bid'
'--enable-decimal-float=dpd'
'--disable-decimal-float'
     Enable (or disable) support for the C decimal floating point
     extension that is in the IEEE 754-2008 standard.  This is enabled
     by default only on PowerPC, i386, and x86_64 GNU/Linux systems.
     Other systems may also support it, but require the user to
     specifically enable it.  You can optionally control which decimal
     floating point format is used (either 'bid' or 'dpd').  The 'bid'
     (binary integer decimal) format is default on i386 and x86_64
     systems, and the 'dpd' (densely packed decimal) format is default
     on PowerPC systems.

'--enable-fixed-point'
'--disable-fixed-point'
     Enable (or disable) support for C fixed-point arithmetic.  This
     option is enabled by default for some targets (such as MIPS) which
     have hardware-support for fixed-point operations.  On other
     targets, you may enable this option manually.

'--with-long-double-128'
     Specify if 'long double' type should be 128-bit by default on
     selected GNU/Linux architectures.  If using
     '--without-long-double-128', 'long double' will be by default
     64-bit, the same as 'double' type.  When neither of these configure
     options are used, the default will be 128-bit 'long double' when
     built against GNU C Library 2.4 and later, 64-bit 'long double'
     otherwise.

'--with-gmp=PATHNAME'
'--with-gmp-include=PATHNAME'
'--with-gmp-lib=PATHNAME'
'--with-mpfr=PATHNAME'
'--with-mpfr-include=PATHNAME'
'--with-mpfr-lib=PATHNAME'
'--with-mpc=PATHNAME'
'--with-mpc-include=PATHNAME'
'--with-mpc-lib=PATHNAME'
     If you want to build GCC but do not have the GMP library, the MPFR
     library and/or the MPC library installed in a standard location and
     do not have their sources present in the GCC source tree then you
     can explicitly specify the directory where they are installed
     ('--with-gmp=GMPINSTALLDIR', '--with-mpfr=MPFRINSTALLDIR',
     '--with-mpc=MPCINSTALLDIR').  The '--with-gmp=GMPINSTALLDIR' option
     is shorthand for '--with-gmp-lib=GMPINSTALLDIR/lib' and
     '--with-gmp-include=GMPINSTALLDIR/include'.  Likewise the
     '--with-mpfr=MPFRINSTALLDIR' option is shorthand for
     '--with-mpfr-lib=MPFRINSTALLDIR/lib' and
     '--with-mpfr-include=MPFRINSTALLDIR/include', also the
     '--with-mpc=MPCINSTALLDIR' option is shorthand for
     '--with-mpc-lib=MPCINSTALLDIR/lib' and
     '--with-mpc-include=MPCINSTALLDIR/include'.  If these shorthand
     assumptions are not correct, you can use the explicit include and
     lib options directly.  You might also need to ensure the shared
     libraries can be found by the dynamic linker when building and
     using GCC, for example by setting the runtime shared library path
     variable ('LD_LIBRARY_PATH' on GNU/Linux and Solaris systems).

     These flags are applicable to the host platform only.  When
     building a cross compiler, they will not be used to configure
     target libraries.

'--with-isl=PATHNAME'
'--with-isl-include=PATHNAME'
'--with-isl-lib=PATHNAME'
'--with-cloog=PATHNAME'
'--with-cloog-include=PATHNAME'
'--with-cloog-lib=PATHNAME'
     If you do not have ISL and the CLooG libraries installed in a
     standard location and you want to build GCC, you can explicitly
     specify the directory where they are installed
     ('--with-isl=ISLINSTALLDIR', '--with-cloog=CLOOGINSTALLDIR').  The
     '--with-isl=ISLINSTALLDIR' option is shorthand for
     '--with-isl-lib=ISLINSTALLDIR/lib' and
     '--with-isl-include=ISLINSTALLDIR/include'.  Likewise the
     '--with-cloog=CLOOGINSTALLDIR' option is shorthand for
     '--with-cloog-lib=CLOOGINSTALLDIR/lib' and
     '--with-cloog-include=CLOOGINSTALLDIR/include'.  If these shorthand
     assumptions are not correct, you can use the explicit include and
     lib options directly.

     These flags are applicable to the host platform only.  When
     building a cross compiler, they will not be used to configure
     target libraries.

'--with-host-libstdcxx=LINKER-ARGS'
     If you are linking with a static copy of PPL, you can use this
     option to specify how the linker should find the standard C++
     library used internally by PPL. Typical values of LINKER-ARGS might
     be '-lstdc++' or '-Wl,-Bstatic,-lstdc++,-Bdynamic -lm'.  If you are
     linking with a shared copy of PPL, you probably do not need this
     option; shared library dependencies will cause the linker to search
     for the standard C++ library automatically.

'--with-stage1-ldflags=FLAGS'
     This option may be used to set linker flags to be used when linking
     stage 1 of GCC. These are also used when linking GCC if configured
     with '--disable-bootstrap'.  By default no special flags are used.

'--with-stage1-libs=LIBS'
     This option may be used to set libraries to be used when linking
     stage 1 of GCC. These are also used when linking GCC if configured
     with '--disable-bootstrap'.  The default is the argument to
     '--with-host-libstdcxx', if specified.

'--with-boot-ldflags=FLAGS'
     This option may be used to set linker flags to be used when linking
     stage 2 and later when bootstrapping GCC. If neither
     -with-boot-libs nor -with-host-libstdcxx is set to a value, then
     the default is '-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc'.

'--with-boot-libs=LIBS'
     This option may be used to set libraries to be used when linking
     stage 2 and later when bootstrapping GCC. The default is the
     argument to '--with-host-libstdcxx', if specified.

'--with-debug-prefix-map=MAP'
     Convert source directory names using '-fdebug-prefix-map' when
     building runtime libraries.  'MAP' is a space-separated list of
     maps of the form 'OLD=NEW'.

'--enable-linker-build-id'
     Tells GCC to pass '--build-id' option to the linker for all final
     links (links performed without the '-r' or '--relocatable' option),
     if the linker supports it.  If you specify
     '--enable-linker-build-id', but your linker does not support
     '--build-id' option, a warning is issued and the
     '--enable-linker-build-id' option is ignored.  The default is off.

'--with-linker-hash-style=CHOICE'
     Tells GCC to pass '--hash-style=CHOICE' option to the linker for
     all final links.  CHOICE can be one of 'sysv', 'gnu', and 'both'
     where 'sysv' is the default.

'--enable-gnu-unique-object'
'--disable-gnu-unique-object'
     Tells GCC to use the gnu_unique_object relocation for C++ template
     static data members and inline function local statics.  Enabled by
     default for a toolchain with an assembler that accepts it and GLIBC
     2.11 or above, otherwise disabled.

'--enable-lto'
'--disable-lto'
     Enable support for link-time optimization (LTO). This is enabled by
     default, and may be disabled using '--disable-lto'.

'--with-plugin-ld=PATHNAME'
     Enable an alternate linker to be used at link-time optimization
     (LTO) link time when '-fuse-linker-plugin' is enabled.  This linker
     should have plugin support such as gold starting with version 2.20
     or GNU ld starting with version 2.21.  See '-fuse-linker-plugin'
     for details.

'--enable-canonical-system-headers'
'--disable-canonical-system-headers'
     Enable system header path canonicalization for 'libcpp'.  This can
     produce shorter header file paths in diagnostics and dependency
     output files, but these changed header paths may conflict with some
     compilation environments.  Enabled by default, and may be disabled
     using '--disable-canonical-system-headers'.

'--with-glibc-version=MAJOR.MINOR'
     Tell GCC that when the GNU C Library (glibc) is used on the target
     it will be version MAJOR.MINOR or later.  Normally this can be
     detected from the C library's header files, but this option may be
     needed when bootstrapping a cross toolchain without the header
     files available for building the initial bootstrap compiler.

     If GCC is configured with some multilibs that use glibc and some
     that do not, this option applies only to the multilibs that use
     glibc.  However, such configurations may not work well as not all
     the relevant configuration in GCC is on a per-multilib basis.

Cross-Compiler-Specific Options
-------------------------------

The following options only apply to building cross compilers.

'--with-sysroot'
'--with-sysroot=DIR'
     Tells GCC to consider DIR as the root of a tree that contains (a
     subset of) the root filesystem of the target operating system.
     Target system headers, libraries and run-time object files will be
     searched for in there.  More specifically, this acts as if
     '--sysroot=DIR' was added to the default options of the built
     compiler.  The specified directory is not copied into the install
     tree, unlike the options '--with-headers' and '--with-libs' that
     this option obsoletes.  The default value, in case '--with-sysroot'
     is not given an argument, is '${gcc_tooldir}/sys-root'.  If the
     specified directory is a subdirectory of '${exec_prefix}', then it
     will be found relative to the GCC binaries if the installation tree
     is moved.

     This option affects the system root for the compiler used to build
     target libraries (which runs on the build system) and the compiler
     newly installed with 'make install'; it does not affect the
     compiler which is used to build GCC itself.

     If you specify the '--with-native-system-header-dir=DIRNAME' option
     then the compiler will search that directory within DIRNAME for
     native system headers rather than the default '/usr/include'.

'--with-build-sysroot'
'--with-build-sysroot=DIR'
     Tells GCC to consider DIR as the system root (see '--with-sysroot')
     while building target libraries, instead of the directory specified
     with '--with-sysroot'.  This option is only useful when you are
     already using '--with-sysroot'.  You can use '--with-build-sysroot'
     when you are configuring with '--prefix' set to a directory that is
     different from the one in which you are installing GCC and your
     target libraries.

     This option affects the system root for the compiler used to build
     target libraries (which runs on the build system); it does not
     affect the compiler which is used to build GCC itself.

     If you specify the '--with-native-system-header-dir=DIRNAME' option
     then the compiler will search that directory within DIRNAME for
     native system headers rather than the default '/usr/include'.

'--with-headers'
'--with-headers=DIR'
     Deprecated in favor of '--with-sysroot'.  Specifies that target
     headers are available when building a cross compiler.  The DIR
     argument specifies a directory which has the target include files.
     These include files will be copied into the 'gcc' install
     directory.  _This option with the DIR argument is required_ when
     building a cross compiler, if 'PREFIX/TARGET/sys-include' doesn't
     pre-exist.  If 'PREFIX/TARGET/sys-include' does pre-exist, the DIR
     argument may be omitted.  'fixincludes' will be run on these files
     to make them compatible with GCC.

'--without-headers'
     Tells GCC not use any target headers from a libc when building a
     cross compiler.  When crossing to GNU/Linux, you need the headers
     so GCC can build the exception handling for libgcc.

'--with-libs'
'--with-libs="DIR1 DIR2 ... DIRN"'
     Deprecated in favor of '--with-sysroot'.  Specifies a list of
     directories which contain the target runtime libraries.  These
     libraries will be copied into the 'gcc' install directory.  If the
     directory list is omitted, this option has no effect.

'--with-newlib'
     Specifies that 'newlib' is being used as the target C library.
     This causes '__eprintf' to be omitted from 'libgcc.a' on the
     assumption that it will be provided by 'newlib'.

'--with-avrlibc'
     Specifies that 'AVR-Libc' is being used as the target C library.
     This causes float support functions like '__addsf3' to be omitted
     from 'libgcc.a' on the assumption that it will be provided by
     'libm.a'.  For more technical details, cf.  PR54461.  This option
     is only supported for the AVR target.  It is not supported for
     RTEMS configurations, which currently use newlib.  The option is
     supported since version 4.7.2 and is the default in 4.8.0 and
     newer.

'--with-nds32-lib=LIBRARY'
     Specifies that LIBRARY setting is used for building 'libgcc.a'.
     Currently, the valid LIBRARY is 'newlib' or 'mculib'.  This option
     is only supported for the NDS32 target.

'--with-build-time-tools=DIR'
     Specifies where to find the set of target tools (assembler, linker,
     etc.)  that will be used while building GCC itself.  This option
     can be useful if the directory layouts are different between the
     system you are building GCC on, and the system where you will
     deploy it.

     For example, on an 'ia64-hp-hpux' system, you may have the GNU
     assembler and linker in '/usr/bin', and the native tools in a
     different path, and build a toolchain that expects to find the
     native tools in '/usr/bin'.

     When you use this option, you should ensure that DIR includes 'ar',
     'as', 'ld', 'nm', 'ranlib' and 'strip' if necessary, and possibly
     'objdump'.  Otherwise, GCC may use an inconsistent set of tools.

Java-Specific Options
---------------------

The following option applies to the build of the Java front end.

'--disable-libgcj'
     Specify that the run-time libraries used by GCJ should not be
     built.  This is useful in case you intend to use GCJ with some
     other run-time, or you're going to install it separately, or it
     just happens not to build on your particular machine.  In general,
     if the Java front end is enabled, the GCJ libraries will be enabled
     too, unless they're known to not work on the target platform.  If
     GCJ is enabled but 'libgcj' isn't built, you may need to port it;
     in this case, before modifying the top-level 'configure.in' so that
     'libgcj' is enabled by default on this platform, you may use
     '--enable-libgcj' to override the default.

   The following options apply to building 'libgcj'.

General Options
...............

'--enable-java-maintainer-mode'
     By default the 'libjava' build will not attempt to compile the
     '.java' source files to '.class'.  Instead, it will use the
     '.class' files from the source tree.  If you use this option you
     must have executables named 'ecj1' and 'gjavah' in your path for
     use by the build.  You must use this option if you intend to modify
     any '.java' files in 'libjava'.

'--with-java-home=DIRNAME'
     This 'libjava' option overrides the default value of the
     'java.home' system property.  It is also used to set
     'sun.boot.class.path' to 'DIRNAME/lib/rt.jar'.  By default
     'java.home' is set to 'PREFIX' and 'sun.boot.class.path' to
     'DATADIR/java/libgcj-VERSION.jar'.

'--with-ecj-jar=FILENAME'
     This option can be used to specify the location of an external jar
     file containing the Eclipse Java compiler.  A specially modified
     version of this compiler is used by 'gcj' to parse '.java' source
     files.  If this option is given, the 'libjava' build will create
     and install an 'ecj1' executable which uses this jar file at
     runtime.

     If this option is not given, but an 'ecj.jar' file is found in the
     topmost source tree at configure time, then the 'libgcj' build will
     create and install 'ecj1', and will also install the discovered
     'ecj.jar' into a suitable place in the install tree.

     If 'ecj1' is not installed, then the user will have to supply one
     on his path in order for 'gcj' to properly parse '.java' source
     files.  A suitable jar is available from
     <ftp://sourceware.org/pub/java/>.

'--disable-getenv-properties'
     Don't set system properties from 'GCJ_PROPERTIES'.

'--enable-hash-synchronization'
     Use a global hash table for monitor locks.  Ordinarily, 'libgcj''s
     'configure' script automatically makes the correct choice for this
     option for your platform.  Only use this if you know you need the
     library to be configured differently.

'--enable-interpreter'
     Enable the Java interpreter.  The interpreter is automatically
     enabled by default on all platforms that support it.  This option
     is really only useful if you want to disable the interpreter (using
     '--disable-interpreter').

'--disable-java-net'
     Disable java.net.  This disables the native part of java.net only,
     using non-functional stubs for native method implementations.

'--disable-jvmpi'
     Disable JVMPI support.

'--disable-libgcj-bc'
     Disable BC ABI compilation of certain parts of libgcj.  By default,
     some portions of libgcj are compiled with '-findirect-dispatch' and
     '-fno-indirect-classes', allowing them to be overridden at
     run-time.

     If '--disable-libgcj-bc' is specified, libgcj is built without
     these options.  This allows the compile-time linker to resolve
     dependencies when statically linking to libgcj.  However it makes
     it impossible to override the affected portions of libgcj at
     run-time.

'--enable-reduced-reflection'
     Build most of libgcj with '-freduced-reflection'.  This reduces the
     size of libgcj at the expense of not being able to do accurate
     reflection on the classes it contains.  This option is safe if you
     know that code using libgcj will never use reflection on the
     standard runtime classes in libgcj (including using serialization,
     RMI or CORBA).

'--with-ecos'
     Enable runtime eCos target support.

'--without-libffi'
     Don't use 'libffi'.  This will disable the interpreter and JNI
     support as well, as these require 'libffi' to work.

'--enable-libgcj-debug'
     Enable runtime debugging code.

'--enable-libgcj-multifile'
     If specified, causes all '.java' source files to be compiled into
     '.class' files in one invocation of 'gcj'.  This can speed up build
     time, but is more resource-intensive.  If this option is
     unspecified or disabled, 'gcj' is invoked once for each '.java'
     file to compile into a '.class' file.

'--with-libiconv-prefix=DIR'
     Search for libiconv in 'DIR/include' and 'DIR/lib'.

'--enable-sjlj-exceptions'
     Force use of the 'setjmp'/'longjmp'-based scheme for exceptions.
     'configure' ordinarily picks the correct value based on the
     platform.  Only use this option if you are sure you need a
     different setting.

'--with-system-zlib'
     Use installed 'zlib' rather than that included with GCC.

'--with-win32-nlsapi=ansi, unicows or unicode'
     Indicates how MinGW 'libgcj' translates between UNICODE characters
     and the Win32 API.

'--enable-java-home'
     If enabled, this creates a JPackage compatible SDK environment
     during install.  Note that if -enable-java-home is used,
     -with-arch-directory=ARCH must also be specified.

'--with-arch-directory=ARCH'
     Specifies the name to use for the 'jre/lib/ARCH' directory in the
     SDK environment created when -enable-java-home is passed.  Typical
     names for this directory include i386, amd64, ia64, etc.

'--with-os-directory=DIR'
     Specifies the OS directory for the SDK include directory.  This is
     set to auto detect, and is typically 'linux'.

'--with-origin-name=NAME'
     Specifies the JPackage origin name.  This defaults to the 'gcj' in
     java-1.5.0-gcj.

'--with-arch-suffix=SUFFIX'
     Specifies the suffix for the sdk directory.  Defaults to the empty
     string.  Examples include '.x86_64' in
     'java-1.5.0-gcj-1.5.0.0.x86_64'.

'--with-jvm-root-dir=DIR'
     Specifies where to install the SDK. Default is $(prefix)/lib/jvm.

'--with-jvm-jar-dir=DIR'
     Specifies where to install jars.  Default is
     $(prefix)/lib/jvm-exports.

'--with-python-dir=DIR'
     Specifies where to install the Python modules used for aot-compile.
     DIR should not include the prefix used in installation.  For
     example, if the Python modules are to be installed in
     /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages, then
     -with-python-dir=/lib/python2.5/site-packages should be passed.  If
     this is not specified, then the Python modules are installed in
     $(prefix)/share/python.

'--enable-aot-compile-rpm'
     Adds aot-compile-rpm to the list of installed scripts.

'--enable-browser-plugin'
     Build the gcjwebplugin web browser plugin.

'--enable-static-libjava'
     Build static libraries in libjava.  The default is to only build
     shared libraries.

     'ansi'
          Use the single-byte 'char' and the Win32 A functions natively,
          translating to and from UNICODE when using these functions.
          If unspecified, this is the default.

     'unicows'
          Use the 'WCHAR' and Win32 W functions natively.  Adds
          '-lunicows' to 'libgcj.spec' to link with 'libunicows'.
          'unicows.dll' needs to be deployed on Microsoft Windows 9X
          machines running built executables.  'libunicows.a', an
          open-source import library around Microsoft's 'unicows.dll',
          is obtained from <http://libunicows.sourceforge.net/>, which
          also gives details on getting 'unicows.dll' from Microsoft.

     'unicode'
          Use the 'WCHAR' and Win32 W functions natively.  Does _not_
          add '-lunicows' to 'libgcj.spec'.  The built executables will
          only run on Microsoft Windows NT and above.

AWT-Specific Options
....................

'--with-x'
     Use the X Window System.

'--enable-java-awt=PEER(S)'
     Specifies the AWT peer library or libraries to build alongside
     'libgcj'.  If this option is unspecified or disabled, AWT will be
     non-functional.  Current valid values are 'gtk' and 'xlib'.
     Multiple libraries should be separated by a comma (i.e.
     '--enable-java-awt=gtk,xlib').

'--enable-gtk-cairo'
     Build the cairo Graphics2D implementation on GTK.

'--enable-java-gc=TYPE'
     Choose garbage collector.  Defaults to 'boehm' if unspecified.

'--disable-gtktest'
     Do not try to compile and run a test GTK+ program.

'--disable-glibtest'
     Do not try to compile and run a test GLIB program.

'--with-libart-prefix=PFX'
     Prefix where libart is installed (optional).

'--with-libart-exec-prefix=PFX'
     Exec prefix where libart is installed (optional).

'--disable-libarttest'
     Do not try to compile and run a test libart program.

Overriding 'configure' test results
...................................

Sometimes, it might be necessary to override the result of some
'configure' test, for example in order to ease porting to a new system
or work around a bug in a test.  The toplevel 'configure' script
provides three variables for this:

'build_configargs'
     The contents of this variable is passed to all build 'configure'
     scripts.

'host_configargs'
     The contents of this variable is passed to all host 'configure'
     scripts.

'target_configargs'
     The contents of this variable is passed to all target 'configure'
     scripts.

   In order to avoid shell and 'make' quoting issues for complex
overrides, you can pass a setting for 'CONFIG_SITE' and set variables in
the site file.


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Building,  Next: Testing,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Installing GCC

5 Building
**********

Now that GCC is configured, you are ready to build the compiler and
runtime libraries.

   Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
nonzero status) and be ignored by 'make'.  These failures, which are
often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can safely be
ignored.

   It is normal to have compiler warnings when compiling certain files.
Unless you are a GCC developer, you can generally ignore these warnings
unless they cause compilation to fail.  Developers should attempt to fix
any warnings encountered, however they can temporarily continue past
warnings-as-errors by specifying the configure flag '--disable-werror'.

   On certain old systems, defining certain environment variables such
as 'CC' can interfere with the functioning of 'make'.

   If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could be
because you have previously configured the compiler in the source
directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary preparations.

   If you build GCC on a BSD system using a directory stored in an old
System V file system, problems may occur in running 'fixincludes' if the
System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These problems
result in a failure to fix the declaration of 'size_t' in 'sys/types.h'.
If you find that 'size_t' is a signed type and that type mismatches
occur, this could be the cause.

   The solution is not to use such a directory for building GCC.

   Similarly, when building from SVN or snapshots, or if you modify
'*.l' files, you need the Flex lexical analyzer generator installed.  If
you do not modify '*.l' files, releases contain the Flex-generated files
and you do not need Flex installed to build them.  There is still one
Flex-based lexical analyzer (part of the build machinery, not of GCC
itself) that is used even if you only build the C front end.

   When building from SVN or snapshots, or if you modify Texinfo
documentation, you need version 4.7 or later of Texinfo installed if you
want Info documentation to be regenerated.  Releases contain Info
documentation pre-built for the unmodified documentation in the release.

5.1 Building a native compiler
==============================

For a native build, the default configuration is to perform a 3-stage
bootstrap of the compiler when 'make' is invoked.  This will build the
entire GCC system and ensure that it compiles itself correctly.  It can
be disabled with the '--disable-bootstrap' parameter to 'configure', but
bootstrapping is suggested because the compiler will be tested more
completely and could also have better performance.

   The bootstrapping process will complete the following steps:

   * Build tools necessary to build the compiler.

   * Perform a 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.  This includes
     building three times the target tools for use by the compiler such
     as binutils (bfd, binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes) if they
     have been individually linked or moved into the top level GCC
     source tree before configuring.

   * Perform a comparison test of the stage2 and stage3 compilers.

   * Build runtime libraries using the stage3 compiler from the previous
     step.

   If you are short on disk space you might consider 'make
bootstrap-lean' instead.  The sequence of compilation is the same
described above, but object files from the stage1 and stage2 of the
3-stage bootstrap of the compiler are deleted as soon as they are no
longer needed.

   If you wish to use non-default GCC flags when compiling the stage2
and stage3 compilers, set 'BOOT_CFLAGS' on the command line when doing
'make'.  For example, if you want to save additional space during the
bootstrap and in the final installation as well, you can build the
compiler binaries without debugging information as in the following
example.  This will save roughly 40% of disk space both for the
bootstrap and the final installation.  (Libraries will still contain
debugging information.)

     make BOOT_CFLAGS='-O' bootstrap

   You can place non-default optimization flags into 'BOOT_CFLAGS'; they
are less well tested here than the default of '-g -O2', but should still
work.  In a few cases, you may find that you need to specify special
flags such as '-msoft-float' here to complete the bootstrap; or, if the
native compiler miscompiles the stage1 compiler, you may need to work
around this, by choosing 'BOOT_CFLAGS' to avoid the parts of the stage1
compiler that were miscompiled, or by using 'make bootstrap4' to
increase the number of stages of bootstrap.

   'BOOT_CFLAGS' does not apply to bootstrapped target libraries.  Since
these are always compiled with the compiler currently being
bootstrapped, you can use 'CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET' to modify their
compilation flags, as for non-bootstrapped target libraries.  Again, if
the native compiler miscompiles the stage1 compiler, you may need to
work around this by avoiding non-working parts of the stage1 compiler.
Use 'STAGE1_TFLAGS' to this end.

   If you used the flag '--enable-languages=...' to restrict the
compilers to be built, only those you've actually enabled will be built.
This will of course only build those runtime libraries, for which the
particular compiler has been built.  Please note, that re-defining
'LANGUAGES' when calling 'make' *does not* work anymore!

   If the comparison of stage2 and stage3 fails, this normally indicates
that the stage2 compiler has compiled GCC incorrectly, and is therefore
a potentially serious bug which you should investigate and report.  (On
a few systems, meaningful comparison of object files is impossible; they
always appear "different".  If you encounter this problem, you will need
to disable comparison in the 'Makefile'.)

   If you do not want to bootstrap your compiler, you can configure with
'--disable-bootstrap'.  In particular cases, you may want to bootstrap
your compiler even if the target system is not the same as the one you
are building on: for example, you could build a
'powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu' toolchain on a 'powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu'
host.  In this case, pass '--enable-bootstrap' to the configure script.

   'BUILD_CONFIG' can be used to bring in additional customization to
the build.  It can be set to a whitespace-separated list of names.  For
each such 'NAME', top-level 'config/NAME.mk' will be included by the
top-level 'Makefile', bringing in any settings it contains.  The default
'BUILD_CONFIG' can be set using the configure option
'--with-build-config=NAME...'.  Some examples of supported build
configurations are:

'bootstrap-O1'
     Removes any '-O'-started option from 'BOOT_CFLAGS', and adds '-O1'
     to it.  'BUILD_CONFIG=bootstrap-O1' is equivalent to
     'BOOT_CFLAGS='-g -O1''.

'bootstrap-O3'
     Analogous to 'bootstrap-O1'.

'bootstrap-lto'
     Enables Link-Time Optimization for host tools during bootstrapping.
     'BUILD_CONFIG=bootstrap-lto' is equivalent to adding '-flto' to
     'BOOT_CFLAGS'.

'bootstrap-debug'
     Verifies that the compiler generates the same executable code,
     whether or not it is asked to emit debug information.  To this end,
     this option builds stage2 host programs without debug information,
     and uses 'contrib/compare-debug' to compare them with the stripped
     stage3 object files.  If 'BOOT_CFLAGS' is overridden so as to not
     enable debug information, stage2 will have it, and stage3 won't.
     This option is enabled by default when GCC bootstrapping is
     enabled, if 'strip' can turn object files compiled with and without
     debug info into identical object files.  In addition to better test
     coverage, this option makes default bootstraps faster and leaner.

'bootstrap-debug-big'
     Rather than comparing stripped object files, as in
     'bootstrap-debug', this option saves internal compiler dumps during
     stage2 and stage3 and compares them as well, which helps catch
     additional potential problems, but at a great cost in terms of disk
     space.  It can be specified in addition to 'bootstrap-debug'.

'bootstrap-debug-lean'
     This option saves disk space compared with 'bootstrap-debug-big',
     but at the expense of some recompilation.  Instead of saving the
     dumps of stage2 and stage3 until the final compare, it uses
     '-fcompare-debug' to generate, compare and remove the dumps during
     stage3, repeating the compilation that already took place in
     stage2, whose dumps were not saved.

'bootstrap-debug-lib'
     This option tests executable code invariance over debug information
     generation on target libraries, just like 'bootstrap-debug-lean'
     tests it on host programs.  It builds stage3 libraries with
     '-fcompare-debug', and it can be used along with any of the
     'bootstrap-debug' options above.

     There aren't '-lean' or '-big' counterparts to this option because
     most libraries are only build in stage3, so bootstrap compares
     would not get significant coverage.  Moreover, the few libraries
     built in stage2 are used in stage3 host programs, so we wouldn't
     want to compile stage2 libraries with different options for
     comparison purposes.

'bootstrap-debug-ckovw'
     Arranges for error messages to be issued if the compiler built on
     any stage is run without the option '-fcompare-debug'.  This is
     useful to verify the full '-fcompare-debug' testing coverage.  It
     must be used along with 'bootstrap-debug-lean' and
     'bootstrap-debug-lib'.

'bootstrap-time'
     Arranges for the run time of each program started by the GCC
     driver, built in any stage, to be logged to 'time.log', in the top
     level of the build tree.

5.2 Building a cross compiler
=============================

When building a cross compiler, it is not generally possible to do a
3-stage bootstrap of the compiler.  This makes for an interesting
problem as parts of GCC can only be built with GCC.

   To build a cross compiler, we recommend first building and installing
a native compiler.  You can then use the native GCC compiler to build
the cross compiler.  The installed native compiler needs to be GCC
version 2.95 or later.

   If the cross compiler is to be built with support for the Java
programming language and the ability to compile .java source files is
desired, the installed native compiler used to build the cross compiler
needs to be the same GCC version as the cross compiler.  In addition the
cross compiler needs to be configured with '--with-ecj-jar=...'.

   Assuming you have already installed a native copy of GCC and
configured your cross compiler, issue the command 'make', which performs
the following steps:

   * Build host tools necessary to build the compiler.

   * Build target tools for use by the compiler such as binutils (bfd,
     binutils, gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes) if they have been
     individually linked or moved into the top level GCC source tree
     before configuring.

   * Build the compiler (single stage only).

   * Build runtime libraries using the compiler from the previous step.

   Note that if an error occurs in any step the make process will exit.

   If you are not building GNU binutils in the same source tree as GCC,
you will need a cross-assembler and cross-linker installed before
configuring GCC.  Put them in the directory 'PREFIX/TARGET/bin'.  Here
is a table of the tools you should put in this directory:

'as'
     This should be the cross-assembler.

'ld'
     This should be the cross-linker.

'ar'
     This should be the cross-archiver: a program which can manipulate
     archive files (linker libraries) in the target machine's format.

'ranlib'
     This should be a program to construct a symbol table in an archive
     file.

   The installation of GCC will find these programs in that directory,
and copy or link them to the proper place to for the cross-compiler to
find them when run later.

   The easiest way to provide these files is to build the Binutils
package.  Configure it with the same '--host' and '--target' options
that you use for configuring GCC, then build and install them.  They
install their executables automatically into the proper directory.
Alas, they do not support all the targets that GCC supports.

   If you are not building a C library in the same source tree as GCC,
you should also provide the target libraries and headers before
configuring GCC, specifying the directories with '--with-sysroot' or
'--with-headers' and '--with-libs'.  Many targets also require "start
files" such as 'crt0.o' and 'crtn.o' which are linked into each
executable.  There may be several alternatives for 'crt0.o', for use
with profiling or other compilation options.  Check your target's
definition of 'STARTFILE_SPEC' to find out what start files it uses.

5.3 Building in parallel
========================

GNU Make 3.80 and above, which is necessary to build GCC, support
building in parallel.  To activate this, you can use 'make -j 2' instead
of 'make'.  You can also specify a bigger number, and in most cases
using a value greater than the number of processors in your machine will
result in fewer and shorter I/O latency hits, thus improving overall
throughput; this is especially true for slow drives and network
filesystems.

5.4 Building the Ada compiler
=============================

In order to build GNAT, the Ada compiler, you need a working GNAT
compiler (GCC version 4.0 or later).  This includes GNAT tools such as
'gnatmake' and 'gnatlink', since the Ada front end is written in Ada and
uses some GNAT-specific extensions.

   In order to build a cross compiler, it is suggested to install the
new compiler as native first, and then use it to build the cross
compiler.

   'configure' does not test whether the GNAT installation works and has
a sufficiently recent version; if too old a GNAT version is installed,
the build will fail unless '--enable-languages' is used to disable
building the Ada front end.

   'ADA_INCLUDE_PATH' and 'ADA_OBJECT_PATH' environment variables must
not be set when building the Ada compiler, the Ada tools, or the Ada
runtime libraries.  You can check that your build environment is clean
by verifying that 'gnatls -v' lists only one explicit path in each
section.

5.5 Building with profile feedback
==================================

It is possible to use profile feedback to optimize the compiler itself.
This should result in a faster compiler binary.  Experiments done on x86
using gcc 3.3 showed approximately 7 percent speedup on compiling C
programs.  To bootstrap the compiler with profile feedback, use 'make
profiledbootstrap'.

   When 'make profiledbootstrap' is run, it will first build a 'stage1'
compiler.  This compiler is used to build a 'stageprofile' compiler
instrumented to collect execution counts of instruction and branch
probabilities.  Then runtime libraries are compiled with profile
collected.  Finally a 'stagefeedback' compiler is built using the
information collected.

   Unlike standard bootstrap, several additional restrictions apply.
The compiler used to build 'stage1' needs to support a 64-bit integral
type.  It is recommended to only use GCC for this.

6 Installing GCC: Testing
*************************

Before you install GCC, we encourage you to run the testsuites and to
compare your results with results from a similar configuration that have
been submitted to the gcc-testresults mailing list.  Some of these
archived results are linked from the build status lists at
<http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html>, although not everyone who reports a
successful build runs the testsuites and submits the results.  This step
is optional and may require you to download additional software, but it
can give you confidence in your new GCC installation or point out
problems before you install and start using your new GCC.

   First, you must have downloaded the testsuites.  These are part of
the full distribution, but if you downloaded the "core" compiler plus
any front ends, you must download the testsuites separately.

   Second, you must have the testing tools installed.  This includes
DejaGnu, Tcl, and Expect; the DejaGnu site has links to these.

   If the directories where 'runtest' and 'expect' were installed are
not in the 'PATH', you may need to set the following environment
variables appropriately, as in the following example (which assumes that
DejaGnu has been installed under '/usr/local'):

     TCL_LIBRARY = /usr/local/share/tcl8.0
     DEJAGNULIBS = /usr/local/share/dejagnu

   (On systems such as Cygwin, these paths are required to be actual
paths, not mounts or links; presumably this is due to some lack of
portability in the DejaGnu code.)

   Finally, you can run the testsuite (which may take a long time):
     cd OBJDIR; make -k check

   This will test various components of GCC, such as compiler front ends
and runtime libraries.  While running the testsuite, DejaGnu might emit
some harmless messages resembling 'WARNING: Couldn't find the global
config file.' or 'WARNING: Couldn't find tool init file' that can be
ignored.

   If you are testing a cross-compiler, you may want to run the
testsuite on a simulator as described at
<http://gcc.gnu.org/simtest-howto.html>.

6.1 How can you run the testsuite on selected tests?
====================================================

In order to run sets of tests selectively, there are targets 'make
check-gcc' and language specific 'make check-c', 'make check-c++', 'make
check-fortran', 'make check-java', 'make check-ada', 'make check-objc',
'make check-obj-c++', 'make check-lto' in the 'gcc' subdirectory of the
object directory.  You can also just run 'make check' in a subdirectory
of the object directory.

   A more selective way to just run all 'gcc' execute tests in the
testsuite is to use

     make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp OTHER-OPTIONS"

   Likewise, in order to run only the 'g++' "old-deja" tests in the
testsuite with filenames matching '9805*', you would use

     make check-g++ RUNTESTFLAGS="old-deja.exp=9805* OTHER-OPTIONS"

   The '*.exp' files are located in the testsuite directories of the GCC
source, the most important ones being 'compile.exp', 'execute.exp',
'dg.exp' and 'old-deja.exp'.  To get a list of the possible '*.exp'
files, pipe the output of 'make check' into a file and look at the
'Running ... .exp' lines.

6.2 Passing options and running multiple testsuites
===================================================

You can pass multiple options to the testsuite using the
'--target_board' option of DejaGNU, either passed as part of
'RUNTESTFLAGS', or directly to 'runtest' if you prefer to work outside
the makefiles.  For example,

     make check-g++ RUNTESTFLAGS="--target_board=unix/-O3/-fmerge-constants"

   will run the standard 'g++' testsuites ("unix" is the target name for
a standard native testsuite situation), passing '-O3 -fmerge-constants'
to the compiler on every test, i.e., slashes separate options.

   You can run the testsuites multiple times using combinations of
options with a syntax similar to the brace expansion of popular shells:

     ..."--target_board=arm-sim\{-mhard-float,-msoft-float\}\{-O1,-O2,-O3,\}"

   (Note the empty option caused by the trailing comma in the final
group.)  The following will run each testsuite eight times using the
'arm-sim' target, as if you had specified all possible combinations
yourself:

     --target_board='arm-sim/-mhard-float/-O1 \
                     arm-sim/-mhard-float/-O2 \
                     arm-sim/-mhard-float/-O3 \
                     arm-sim/-mhard-float \
                     arm-sim/-msoft-float/-O1 \
                     arm-sim/-msoft-float/-O2 \
                     arm-sim/-msoft-float/-O3 \
                     arm-sim/-msoft-float'

   They can be combined as many times as you wish, in arbitrary ways.
This list:

     ..."--target_board=unix/-Wextra\{-O3,-fno-strength\}\{-fomit-frame,\}"

   will generate four combinations, all involving '-Wextra'.

   The disadvantage to this method is that the testsuites are run in
serial, which is a waste on multiprocessor systems.  For users with GNU
Make and a shell which performs brace expansion, you can run the
testsuites in parallel by having the shell perform the combinations and
'make' do the parallel runs.  Instead of using '--target_board', use a
special makefile target:

     make -jN check-TESTSUITE//TEST-TARGET/OPTION1/OPTION2/...

   For example,

     make -j3 check-gcc//sh-hms-sim/{-m1,-m2,-m3,-m3e,-m4}/{,-nofpu}

   will run three concurrent "make-gcc" testsuites, eventually testing
all ten combinations as described above.  Note that this is currently
only supported in the 'gcc' subdirectory.  (To see how this works, try
typing 'echo' before the example given here.)

6.3 Additional testing for Java Class Libraries
===============================================

The Java runtime tests can be executed via 'make check' in the
'TARGET/libjava/testsuite' directory in the build tree.

   The Mauve Project provides a suite of tests for the Java Class
Libraries.  This suite can be run as part of libgcj testing by placing
the Mauve tree within the libjava testsuite at
'libjava/testsuite/libjava.mauve/mauve', or by specifying the location
of that tree when invoking 'make', as in 'make MAUVEDIR=~/mauve check'.

6.4 How to interpret test results
=================================

The result of running the testsuite are various '*.sum' and '*.log'
files in the testsuite subdirectories.  The '*.log' files contain a
detailed log of the compiler invocations and the corresponding results,
the '*.sum' files summarize the results.  These summaries contain status
codes for all tests:

   * PASS: the test passed as expected
   * XPASS: the test unexpectedly passed
   * FAIL: the test unexpectedly failed
   * XFAIL: the test failed as expected
   * UNSUPPORTED: the test is not supported on this platform
   * ERROR: the testsuite detected an error
   * WARNING: the testsuite detected a possible problem

   It is normal for some tests to report unexpected failures.  At the
current time the testing harness does not allow fine grained control
over whether or not a test is expected to fail.  This problem should be
fixed in future releases.

6.5 Submitting test results
===========================

If you want to report the results to the GCC project, use the
'contrib/test_summary' shell script.  Start it in the OBJDIR with

     SRCDIR/contrib/test_summary -p your_commentary.txt \
         -m gcc-testresults@gcc.gnu.org |sh

   This script uses the 'Mail' program to send the results, so make sure
it is in your 'PATH'.  The file 'your_commentary.txt' is prepended to
the testsuite summary and should contain any special remarks you have on
your results or your build environment.  Please do not edit the
testsuite result block or the subject line, as these messages may be
automatically processed.

7 Installing GCC: Final installation
************************************

Now that GCC has been built (and optionally tested), you can install it
with
     cd OBJDIR && make install

   We strongly recommend to install into a target directory where there
is no previous version of GCC present.  Also, the GNAT runtime should
not be stripped, as this would break certain features of the debugger
that depend on this debugging information (catching Ada exceptions for
instance).

   That step completes the installation of GCC; user level binaries can
be found in 'PREFIX/bin' where PREFIX is the value you specified with
the '--prefix' to configure (or '/usr/local' by default).  (If you
specified '--bindir', that directory will be used instead; otherwise, if
you specified '--exec-prefix', 'EXEC-PREFIX/bin' will be used.)  Headers
for the C++ and Java libraries are installed in 'PREFIX/include';
libraries in 'LIBDIR' (normally 'PREFIX/lib'); internal parts of the
compiler in 'LIBDIR/gcc' and 'LIBEXECDIR/gcc'; documentation in info
format in 'INFODIR' (normally 'PREFIX/info').

   When installing cross-compilers, GCC's executables are not only
installed into 'BINDIR', that is, 'EXEC-PREFIX/bin', but additionally
into 'EXEC-PREFIX/TARGET-ALIAS/bin', if that directory exists.
Typically, such "tooldirs" hold target-specific binutils, including
assembler and linker.

   Installation into a temporary staging area or into a 'chroot' jail
can be achieved with the command

     make DESTDIR=PATH-TO-ROOTDIR install

where PATH-TO-ROOTDIR is the absolute path of a directory relative to
which all installation paths will be interpreted.  Note that the
directory specified by 'DESTDIR' need not exist yet; it will be created
if necessary.

   There is a subtle point with tooldirs and 'DESTDIR': If you relocate
a cross-compiler installation with e.g. 'DESTDIR=ROOTDIR', then the
directory 'ROOTDIR/EXEC-PREFIX/TARGET-ALIAS/bin' will be filled with
duplicated GCC executables only if it already exists, it will not be
created otherwise.  This is regarded as a feature, not as a bug, because
it gives slightly more control to the packagers using the 'DESTDIR'
feature.

   You can install stripped programs and libraries with

     make install-strip

   If you are bootstrapping a released version of GCC then please
quickly review the build status page for your release, available from
<http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html>.  If your system is not listed for
the version of GCC that you built, send a note to <gcc@gcc.gnu.org>
indicating that you successfully built and installed GCC.  Include the
following information:

   * Output from running 'SRCDIR/config.guess'.  Do not send that file
     itself, just the one-line output from running it.

   * The output of 'gcc -v' for your newly installed 'gcc'.  This tells
     us which version of GCC you built and the options you passed to
     configure.

   * Whether you enabled all languages or a subset of them.  If you used
     a full distribution then this information is part of the configure
     options in the output of 'gcc -v', but if you downloaded the "core"
     compiler plus additional front ends then it isn't apparent which
     ones you built unless you tell us about it.

   * If the build was for GNU/Linux, also include:
        * The distribution name and version (e.g., Red Hat 7.1 or Debian
          2.2.3); this information should be available from
          '/etc/issue'.

        * The version of the Linux kernel, available from 'uname
          --version' or 'uname -a'.

        * The version of glibc you used; for RPM-based systems like Red
          Hat, Mandrake, and SuSE type 'rpm -q glibc' to get the glibc
          version, and on systems like Debian and Progeny use 'dpkg -l
          libc6'.
     For other systems, you can include similar information if you think
     it is relevant.

   * Any other information that you think would be useful to people
     building GCC on the same configuration.  The new entry in the build
     status list will include a link to the archived copy of your
     message.

   We'd also like to know if the *note host/target specific installation
notes: Specific. didn't include your host/target information or if that
information is incomplete or out of date.  Send a note to
<gcc@gcc.gnu.org> detailing how the information should be changed.

   If you find a bug, please report it following the bug reporting
guidelines.

   If you want to print the GCC manuals, do 'cd OBJDIR; make dvi'.  You
will need to have 'texi2dvi' (version at least 4.7) and TeX installed.
This creates a number of '.dvi' files in subdirectories of 'OBJDIR';
these may be converted for printing with programs such as 'dvips'.
Alternately, by using 'make pdf' in place of 'make dvi', you can create
documentation in the form of '.pdf' files; this requires 'texi2pdf',
which is included with Texinfo version 4.8 and later.  You can also buy
printed manuals from the Free Software Foundation, though such manuals
may not be for the most recent version of GCC.

   If you would like to generate online HTML documentation, do 'cd
OBJDIR; make html' and HTML will be generated for the gcc manuals in
'OBJDIR/gcc/HTML'.

9 Host/target specific installation notes for GCC
*************************************************

Please read this document carefully _before_ installing the GNU Compiler
Collection on your machine.

   Note that this list of install notes is _not_ a list of supported
hosts or targets.  Not all supported hosts and targets are listed here,
only the ones that require host-specific or target-specific information
have to.

alpha*-*-*
==========

This section contains general configuration information for all
alpha-based platforms using ELF (in particular, ignore this section for
DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX and Tru64 UNIX).  In addition to reading this
section, please read all other sections that match your target.

   We require binutils 2.11.2 or newer.  Previous binutils releases had
a number of problems with DWARF 2 debugging information, not the least
of which is incorrect linking of shared libraries.

alpha*-dec-osf5.1
=================

Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture and
are running the DEC/Compaq/HP Unix (DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, or
Compaq/HP Tru64 UNIX) operating system, for example the DEC Alpha AXP
systems.

   Support for Tru64 UNIX V5.1 has been removed in GCC 4.8.  As of GCC
4.6, support for Tru64 UNIX V4.0 and V5.0 has been removed.  As of GCC
3.2, versions before 'alpha*-dec-osf4' are no longer supported.  (These
are the versions which identify themselves as DEC OSF/1.)

amd64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*
========================

This is a synonym for 'x86_64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*'.

arc-*-elf32
===========

Use 'configure --target=arc-elf32 --with-cpu=CPU
--enable-languages="c,c++"' to configure GCC, with CPU being one of
'arc600', 'arc601', or 'arc700'.

arc-linux-uclibc
================

Use 'configure --target=arc-linux-uclibc --with-cpu=arc700
--enable-languages="c,c++"' to configure GCC.

arm-*-eabi
==========

ARM-family processors.  Subtargets that use the ELF object format
require GNU binutils 2.13 or newer.  Such subtargets include:
'arm-*-netbsdelf', 'arm-*-*linux-*' and 'arm-*-rtemseabi'.

avr
===

ATMEL AVR-family micro controllers.  These are used in embedded
applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.  *Note AVR
Options: (gcc)AVR Options, for the list of supported MCU types.

   Use 'configure --target=avr --enable-languages="c"' to configure GCC.

   Further installation notes and other useful information about AVR
tools can also be obtained from:

   * http://www.nongnu.org/avr/
   * http://www.amelek.gda.pl/avr/

   We _strongly_ recommend using binutils 2.13 or newer.

   The following error:
     Error: register required

   indicates that you should upgrade to a newer version of the binutils.

Blackfin
========

The Blackfin processor, an Analog Devices DSP. *Note Blackfin Options:
(gcc)Blackfin Options,

   More information, and a version of binutils with support for this
processor, is available at <http://blackfin.uclinux.org>

CR16
====

The CR16 CompactRISC architecture is a 16-bit architecture.  This
architecture is used in embedded applications.

   *Note CR16 Options: (gcc)CR16 Options,

   Use 'configure --target=cr16-elf --enable-languages=c,c++' to
configure GCC for building a CR16 elf cross-compiler.

   Use 'configure --target=cr16-uclinux --enable-languages=c,c++' to
configure GCC for building a CR16 uclinux cross-compiler.

CRIS
====

CRIS is the CPU architecture in Axis Communications ETRAX
system-on-a-chip series.  These are used in embedded applications.

   *Note CRIS Options: (gcc)CRIS Options, for a list of CRIS-specific
options.

   There are a few different CRIS targets:
'cris-axis-elf'
     Mainly for monolithic embedded systems.  Includes a multilib for
     the 'v10' core used in 'ETRAX 100 LX'.
'cris-axis-linux-gnu'
     A GNU/Linux port for the CRIS architecture, currently targeting
     'ETRAX 100 LX' by default.

   For 'cris-axis-elf' you need binutils 2.11 or newer.  For
'cris-axis-linux-gnu' you need binutils 2.12 or newer.

   Pre-packaged tools can be obtained from
<ftp://ftp.axis.com/pub/axis/tools/cris/compiler-kit/>.  More
information about this platform is available at
<http://developer.axis.com/>.

DOS
===

Please have a look at the binaries page.

   You cannot install GCC by itself on MSDOS; it will not compile under
any MSDOS compiler except itself.  You need to get the complete
compilation package DJGPP, which includes binaries as well as sources,
and includes all the necessary compilation tools and libraries.

epiphany-*-elf
==============

Adapteva Epiphany.  This configuration is intended for embedded systems.

*-*-freebsd*
============

Support for FreeBSD 1 was discontinued in GCC 3.2.  Support for FreeBSD
2 (and any mutant a.out variants of FreeBSD 3) was discontinued in GCC
4.0.

   In order to better utilize FreeBSD base system functionality and
match the configuration of the system compiler, GCC 4.5 and above as
well as GCC 4.4 past 2010-06-20 leverage SSP support in libc (which is
present on FreeBSD 7 or later) and the use of '__cxa_atexit' by default
(on FreeBSD 6 or later).  The use of 'dl_iterate_phdr' inside
'libgcc_s.so.1' and boehm-gc (on FreeBSD 7 or later) is enabled by GCC
4.5 and above.

   We support FreeBSD using the ELF file format with DWARF 2 debugging
for all CPU architectures.  You may use '-gstabs' instead of '-g', if
you really want the old debugging format.  There are no known issues
with mixing object files and libraries with different debugging formats.
Otherwise, this release of GCC should now match more of the
configuration used in the stock FreeBSD configuration of GCC.  In
particular, '--enable-threads' is now configured by default.  However,
as a general user, do not attempt to replace the system compiler with
this release.  Known to bootstrap and check with good results on FreeBSD
7.2-STABLE.  In the past, known to bootstrap and check with good results
on FreeBSD 3.0, 3.4, 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.9 and 5-CURRENT.

   The version of binutils installed in '/usr/bin' probably works with
this release of GCC.  Bootstrapping against the latest GNU binutils
and/or the version found in '/usr/ports/devel/binutils' has been known
to enable additional features and improve overall testsuite results.
However, it is currently known that boehm-gc (which itself is required
for java) may not configure properly on FreeBSD prior to the FreeBSD 7.0
release with GNU binutils after 2.16.1.

h8300-hms
=========

Renesas H8/300 series of processors.

   Please have a look at the binaries page.

   The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release
2.6.  All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now passes
the first three arguments in function calls in registers.  Structures
are no longer a multiple of 2 bytes.

hppa*-hp-hpux*
==============

Support for HP-UX version 9 and older was discontinued in GCC 3.4.

   We require using gas/binutils on all hppa platforms.  Version 2.19 or
later is recommended.

   It may be helpful to configure GCC with the '--with-gnu-as' and
'--with-as=...' options to ensure that GCC can find GAS.

   The HP assembler should not be used with GCC. It is rarely tested and
may not work.  It shouldn't be used with any languages other than C due
to its many limitations.

   Specifically, '-g' does not work (HP-UX uses a peculiar debugging
format which GCC does not know about).  It also inserts timestamps into
each object file it creates, causing the 3-stage comparison test to fail
during a bootstrap.  You should be able to continue by saying 'make
all-host all-target' after getting the failure from 'make'.

   Various GCC features are not supported.  For example, it does not
support weak symbols or alias definitions.  As a result, explicit
template instantiations are required when using C++.  This makes it
difficult if not impossible to build many C++ applications.

   There are two default scheduling models for instructions.  These are
PROCESSOR_7100LC and PROCESSOR_8000.  They are selected from the pa-risc
architecture specified for the target machine when configuring.
PROCESSOR_8000 is the default.  PROCESSOR_7100LC is selected when the
target is a 'hppa1*' machine.

   The PROCESSOR_8000 model is not well suited to older processors.
Thus, it is important to completely specify the machine architecture
when configuring if you want a model other than PROCESSOR_8000.  The
macro TARGET_SCHED_DEFAULT can be defined in BOOT_CFLAGS if a different
default scheduling model is desired.

   As of GCC 4.0, GCC uses the UNIX 95 namespace for HP-UX 10.10 through
11.00, and the UNIX 98 namespace for HP-UX 11.11 and later.  This
namespace change might cause problems when bootstrapping with an earlier
version of GCC or the HP compiler as essentially the same namespace is
required for an entire build.  This problem can be avoided in a number
of ways.  With HP cc, 'UNIX_STD' can be set to '95' or '98'.  Another
way is to add an appropriate set of predefines to 'CC'.  The description
for the 'munix=' option contains a list of the predefines used with each
standard.

   More specific information to 'hppa*-hp-hpux*' targets follows.

hppa*-hp-hpux10
===============

For hpux10.20, we _highly_ recommend you pick up the latest sed patch
'PHCO_19798' from HP.

   The C++ ABI has changed incompatibly in GCC 4.0.  COMDAT subspaces
are used for one-only code and data.  This resolves many of the previous
problems in using C++ on this target.  However, the ABI is not
compatible with the one implemented under HP-UX 11 using secondary
definitions.

hppa*-hp-hpux11
===============

GCC 3.0 and up support HP-UX 11.  GCC 2.95.x is not supported and cannot
be used to compile GCC 3.0 and up.

   The libffi and libjava libraries haven't been ported to 64-bit
HP-UX and don't build.

   Refer to binaries for information about obtaining precompiled GCC
binaries for HP-UX.  Precompiled binaries must be obtained to build the
Ada language as it can't be bootstrapped using C.  Ada is only available
for the 32-bit PA-RISC runtime.

   Starting with GCC 3.4 an ISO C compiler is required to bootstrap.
The bundled compiler supports only traditional C; you will need either
HP's unbundled compiler, or a binary distribution of GCC.

   It is possible to build GCC 3.3 starting with the bundled HP
compiler, but the process requires several steps.  GCC 3.3 can then be
used to build later versions.  The fastjar program contains ISO C code
and can't be built with the HP bundled compiler.  This problem can be
avoided by not building the Java language.  For example, use the
'--enable-languages="c,c++,f77,objc"' option in your configure command.

   There are several possible approaches to building the distribution.
Binutils can be built first using the HP tools.  Then, the GCC
distribution can be built.  The second approach is to build GCC first
using the HP tools, then build binutils, then rebuild GCC.  There have
been problems with various binary distributions, so it is best not to
start from a binary distribution.

   On 64-bit capable systems, there are two distinct targets.  Different
installation prefixes must be used if both are to be installed on the
same system.  The 'hppa[1-2]*-hp-hpux11*' target generates code for the
32-bit PA-RISC runtime architecture and uses the HP linker.  The
'hppa64-hp-hpux11*' target generates 64-bit code for the PA-RISC 2.0
architecture.

   The script config.guess now selects the target type based on the
compiler detected during configuration.  You must define 'PATH' or 'CC'
so that configure finds an appropriate compiler for the initial
bootstrap.  When 'CC' is used, the definition should contain the options
that are needed whenever 'CC' is used.

   Specifically, options that determine the runtime architecture must be
in 'CC' to correctly select the target for the build.  It is also
convenient to place many other compiler options in 'CC'.  For example,
'CC="cc -Ac +DA2.0W -Wp,-H16376 -D_CLASSIC_TYPES -D_HPUX_SOURCE"' can be
used to bootstrap the GCC 3.3 branch with the HP compiler in 64-bit
K&R/bundled mode.  The '+DA2.0W' option will result in the automatic
selection of the 'hppa64-hp-hpux11*' target.  The macro definition table
of cpp needs to be increased for a successful build with the HP
compiler.  _CLASSIC_TYPES and _HPUX_SOURCE need to be defined when
building with the bundled compiler, or when using the '-Ac' option.
These defines aren't necessary with '-Ae'.

   It is best to explicitly configure the 'hppa64-hp-hpux11*' target
with the '--with-ld=...' option.  This overrides the standard search for
ld.  The two linkers supported on this target require different
commands.  The default linker is determined during configuration.  As a
result, it's not possible to switch linkers in the middle of a GCC
build.  This has been reported to sometimes occur in unified builds of
binutils and GCC.

   A recent linker patch must be installed for the correct operation of
GCC 3.3 and later.  'PHSS_26559' and 'PHSS_24304' are the oldest linker
patches that are known to work.  They are for HP-UX 11.00 and 11.11,
respectively.  'PHSS_24303', the companion to 'PHSS_24304', might be
usable but it hasn't been tested.  These patches have been superseded.
Consult the HP patch database to obtain the currently recommended linker
patch for your system.

   The patches are necessary for the support of weak symbols on the
32-bit port, and for the running of initializers and finalizers.  Weak
symbols are implemented using SOM secondary definition symbols.  Prior
to HP-UX 11, there are bugs in the linker support for secondary symbols.
The patches correct a problem of linker core dumps creating shared
libraries containing secondary symbols, as well as various other linking
issues involving secondary symbols.

   GCC 3.3 uses the ELF DT_INIT_ARRAY and DT_FINI_ARRAY capabilities to
run initializers and finalizers on the 64-bit port.  The 32-bit port
uses the linker '+init' and '+fini' options for the same purpose.  The
patches correct various problems with the +init/+fini options, including
program core dumps.  Binutils 2.14 corrects a problem on the 64-bit port
resulting from HP's non-standard use of the .init and .fini sections for
array initializers and finalizers.

   Although the HP and GNU linkers are both supported for the
'hppa64-hp-hpux11*' target, it is strongly recommended that the HP
linker be used for link editing on this target.

   At this time, the GNU linker does not support the creation of long
branch stubs.  As a result, it can't successfully link binaries
containing branch offsets larger than 8 megabytes.  In addition, there
are problems linking shared libraries, linking executables with
'-static', and with dwarf2 unwind and exception support.  It also
doesn't provide stubs for internal calls to global functions in shared
libraries, so these calls can't be overloaded.

   The HP dynamic loader does not support GNU symbol versioning, so
symbol versioning is not supported.  It may be necessary to disable
symbol versioning with '--disable-symvers' when using GNU ld.

   POSIX threads are the default.  The optional DCE thread library is
not supported, so '--enable-threads=dce' does not work.

*-*-linux-gnu
=============

Versions of libstdc++-v3 starting with 3.2.1 require bug fixes present
in glibc 2.2.5 and later.  More information is available in the
libstdc++-v3 documentation.

i?86-*-linux*
=============

As of GCC 3.3, binutils 2.13.1 or later is required for this platform.
See bug 10877 for more information.

   If you receive Signal 11 errors when building on GNU/Linux, then it
is possible you have a hardware problem.  Further information on this
can be found on www.bitwizard.nl.

i?86-*-solaris2.9
=================

The Sun assembler in Solaris 9 has several bugs and limitations.  While
GCC works around them, several features are missing, so it is
recommended to use the GNU assembler instead.  There is no bundled
version, but the current version, from GNU binutils 2.22, is known to
work.

   Solaris 2/x86 doesn't support the execution of SSE/SSE2 instructions
before Solaris 9 4/04, even if the CPU supports them.  Programs will
receive 'SIGILL' if they try.  The fix is available both in Solaris 9
Update 6 and kernel patch 112234-12 or newer.  To avoid this problem,
'-march' defaults to 'pentiumpro' on Solaris 9.  If you have the patch
installed, you can configure GCC with an appropriate '--with-arch'
option, but need GNU 'as' for SSE2 support.

i?86-*-solaris2.10
==================

Use this for Solaris 10 or later on x86 and x86-64 systems.  Starting
with GCC 4.7, there is also a 64-bit 'amd64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*' or
'x86_64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*' configuration that corresponds to
'sparcv9-sun-solaris2*'.

   It is recommended that you configure GCC to use the GNU assembler, in
'/usr/sfw/bin/gas'.  The versions included in Solaris 10, from GNU
binutils 2.15, and Solaris 11, from GNU binutils 2.19, work fine,
although the current version, from GNU binutils 2.22, is known to work,
too.  Recent versions of the Sun assembler in '/usr/ccs/bin/as' work
almost as well, though.

   For linking, the Sun linker, is preferred.  If you want to use the
GNU linker instead, which is available in '/usr/sfw/bin/gld', note that
due to a packaging bug the version in Solaris 10, from GNU binutils
2.15, cannot be used, while the version in Solaris 11, from GNU binutils
2.19, works, as does the latest version, from GNU binutils 2.22.

   To use GNU 'as', configure with the options '--with-gnu-as
--with-as=/usr/sfw/bin/gas'.  It may be necessary to configure with
'--without-gnu-ld --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld' to guarantee use of Sun
'ld'.

ia64-*-linux
============

IA-64 processor (also known as IPF, or Itanium Processor Family) running
GNU/Linux.

   If you are using the installed system libunwind library with
'--with-system-libunwind', then you must use libunwind 0.98 or later.

   None of the following versions of GCC has an ABI that is compatible
with any of the other versions in this list, with the exception that Red
Hat 2.96 and Trillian 000171 are compatible with each other: 3.1, 3.0.2,
3.0.1, 3.0, Red Hat 2.96, and Trillian 000717.  This primarily affects
C++ programs and programs that create shared libraries.  GCC 3.1 or
later is recommended for compiling linux, the kernel.  As of version 3.1
GCC is believed to be fully ABI compliant, and hence no more major ABI
changes are expected.

ia64-*-hpux*
============

Building GCC on this target requires the GNU Assembler.  The bundled HP
assembler will not work.  To prevent GCC from using the wrong assembler,
the option '--with-gnu-as' may be necessary.

   The GCC libunwind library has not been ported to HPUX.  This means
that for GCC versions 3.2.3 and earlier, '--enable-libunwind-exceptions'
is required to build GCC.  For GCC 3.3 and later, this is the default.
For gcc 3.4.3 and later, '--enable-libunwind-exceptions' is removed and
the system libunwind library will always be used.

aarch64*-*-*
============

Binutils pre 2.24 does not have support for selecting '-mabi' and does
not support ILP32.  If it is used to build GCC 4.9 or later, GCC will
not support option '-mabi=ilp32'.

   To enable a workaround for the Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769 by
default (for all CPUs regardless of -mcpu option given) at configure
time use the '--enable-fix-cortex-a53-835769' option.  This will enable
the fix by default and can be explicitly disabled during during
compilation by passing the '-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769' option.
Conversely, '--disable-fix-cortex-a53-835769' will disable the
workaround by default.  The workaround is disabled by default if neither
of '--enable-fix-cortex-a53-835769' or '--disable-fix-cortex-a53-835769'
is given at configure time.

*-ibm-aix*
==========

Support for AIX version 3 and older was discontinued in GCC 3.4.
Support for AIX version 4.2 and older was discontinued in GCC 4.5.

   "out of memory" bootstrap failures may indicate a problem with
process resource limits (ulimit).  Hard limits are configured in the
'/etc/security/limits' system configuration file.

   GCC can bootstrap with recent versions of IBM XLC, but bootstrapping
with an earlier release of GCC is recommended.  Bootstrapping with XLC
requires a larger data segment, which can be enabled through the
LDR_CNTRL environment variable, e.g.,

     % LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x50000000
     % export LDR_CNTRL

   One can start with a pre-compiled version of GCC to build from
sources.  One may delete GCC's "fixed" header files when starting with a
version of GCC built for an earlier release of AIX.

   To speed up the configuration phases of bootstrapping and installing
GCC, one may use GNU Bash instead of AIX '/bin/sh', e.g.,

     % CONFIG_SHELL=/opt/freeware/bin/bash
     % export CONFIG_SHELL

   and then proceed as described in the build instructions, where we
strongly recommend specifying an absolute path to invoke
SRCDIR/configure.

   Because GCC on AIX is built as a 32-bit executable by default,
(although it can generate 64-bit programs) the GMP and MPFR libraries
required by gfortran must be 32-bit libraries.  Building GMP and MPFR as
static archive libraries works better than shared libraries.

   Errors involving 'alloca' when building GCC generally are due to an
incorrect definition of 'CC' in the Makefile or mixing files compiled
with the native C compiler and GCC.  During the stage1 phase of the
build, the native AIX compiler *must* be invoked as 'cc' (not 'xlc').
Once 'configure' has been informed of 'xlc', one needs to use 'make
distclean' to remove the configure cache files and ensure that 'CC'
environment variable does not provide a definition that will confuse
'configure'.  If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the
problem most likely is the version of Make (see above).

   The native 'as' and 'ld' are recommended for bootstrapping on AIX.
The GNU Assembler, GNU Linker, and GNU Binutils version 2.20 is the
minimum level that supports bootstrap on AIX 5.  The GNU Assembler has
not been updated to support AIX 6 or AIX 7.  The native AIX tools do
interoperate with GCC.

   AIX 5.3 TL10, AIX 6.1 TL05 and AIX 7.1 TL00 introduced an AIX
assembler change that sometimes produces corrupt assembly files causing
AIX linker errors.  The bug breaks GCC bootstrap on AIX and can cause
compilation failures with existing GCC installations.  An AIX iFix for
AIX 5.3 is available (APAR IZ98385 for AIX 5.3 TL10, APAR IZ98477 for
AIX 5.3 TL11 and IZ98134 for AIX 5.3 TL12).  AIX 5.3 TL11 SP8, AIX 5.3
TL12 SP5, AIX 6.1 TL04 SP11, AIX 6.1 TL05 SP7, AIX 6.1 TL06 SP6, AIX 6.1
TL07 and AIX 7.1 TL01 should include the fix.

   Building 'libstdc++.a' requires a fix for an AIX Assembler bug APAR
IY26685 (AIX 4.3) or APAR IY25528 (AIX 5.1).  It also requires a fix for
another AIX Assembler bug and a co-dependent AIX Archiver fix referenced
as APAR IY53606 (AIX 5.2) or as APAR IY54774 (AIX 5.1)

   'libstdc++' in GCC 3.4 increments the major version number of the
shared object and GCC installation places the 'libstdc++.a' shared
library in a common location which will overwrite the and GCC 3.3
version of the shared library.  Applications either need to be re-linked
against the new shared library or the GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.3 versions of
the 'libstdc++' shared object needs to be available to the AIX runtime
loader.  The GCC 3.1 'libstdc++.so.4', if present, and GCC 3.3
'libstdc++.so.5' shared objects can be installed for runtime dynamic
loading using the following steps to set the 'F_LOADONLY' flag in the
shared object for _each_ multilib 'libstdc++.a' installed:

   Extract the shared objects from the currently installed 'libstdc++.a'
archive:
     % ar -x libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4 libstdc++.so.5

   Enable the 'F_LOADONLY' flag so that the shared object will be
available for runtime dynamic loading, but not linking:
     % strip -e libstdc++.so.4 libstdc++.so.5

   Archive the runtime-only shared object in the GCC 3.4 'libstdc++.a'
archive:
     % ar -q libstdc++.a libstdc++.so.4 libstdc++.so.5

   Linking executables and shared libraries may produce warnings of
duplicate symbols.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always
have included multiple symbol definitions for certain global variable
and function declarations in the original program.  The warnings should
not prevent the linker from producing a correct library or runnable
executable.

   AIX 4.3 utilizes a "large format" archive to support both 32-bit and
64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1
to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly.
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during
linking such as "not a COFF file".  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The '-g' option of
the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit objects
using the original "small format".  A correct version of the routines is
shipped with AIX 4.3.2 and above.

   Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
overflow severe error when the '-bbigtoc' option is used to link
GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC.  A
fix for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND -BBIGTOC)
is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
techsupport.services.ibm.com website as PTF U455193.

   The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump
core with a segmentation fault when invoked by any version of GCC.  A
fix for APAR IX87327 is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
techsupport.services.ibm.com website as PTF U461879.  This fix is
incorporated in AIX 4.3.3 and above.

   The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect
object files.  A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUTPUT FROM
COMPILER FAILS TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer Support
and from its techsupport.services.ibm.com website as PTF U453956.  This
fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.

   AIX provides National Language Support (NLS).  Compilers and
assemblers use NLS to support locale-specific representations of various
data formats including floating-point numbers (e.g., '.' vs ',' for
separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems reported where
GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler
expects.  If one encounters this problem, set the 'LANG' environment
variable to 'C' or 'En_US'.

   A default can be specified with the '-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' switch and using
the configure option '--with-cpu-CPU_TYPE'.

m68k-*-*
========

By default, 'm68k-*-elf*', 'm68k-*-rtems', 'm68k-*-uclinux' and
'm68k-*-linux' build libraries for both M680x0 and ColdFire processors.
If you only need the M680x0 libraries, you can omit the ColdFire ones by
passing '--with-arch=m68k' to 'configure'.  Alternatively, you can omit
the M680x0 libraries by passing '--with-arch=cf' to 'configure'.  These
targets default to 5206 or 5475 code as appropriate for the target
system when configured with '--with-arch=cf' and 68020 code otherwise.

   The 'm68k-*-netbsd' and 'm68k-*-openbsd' targets also support the
'--with-arch' option.  They will generate ColdFire CFV4e code when
configured with '--with-arch=cf' and 68020 code otherwise.

   You can override the default processors listed above by configuring
with '--with-cpu=TARGET'.  This TARGET can either be a '-mcpu' argument
or one of the following values: 'm68000', 'm68010', 'm68020', 'm68030',
'm68040', 'm68060', 'm68020-40' and 'm68020-60'.

   GCC requires at least binutils version 2.17 on these targets.

m68k-*-uclinux
==============

GCC 4.3 changed the uClinux configuration so that it uses the
'm68k-linux-gnu' ABI rather than the 'm68k-elf' ABI. It also added

ABI changes.

mips-*-*
========

If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying "does not have gp
sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]", don't worry about it.  This
happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but there is not
really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the output file.  You can
stop such warnings by installing the GNU linker.

   It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they are
optional, and there should not be a warning about their absence.

   The libstdc++ atomic locking routines for MIPS targets requires MIPS
II and later.  A patch went in just after the GCC 3.3 release to make
'mips*-*-*' use the generic implementation instead.  You can also
configure for 'mipsel-elf' as a workaround.  The 'mips*-*-linux*' target
continues to use the MIPS II routines.  More work on this is expected in
future releases.

   The built-in '__sync_*' functions are available on MIPS II and later
systems and others that support the 'll', 'sc' and 'sync' instructions.
This can be overridden by passing '--with-llsc' or '--without-llsc' when
configuring GCC. Since the Linux kernel emulates these instructions if
they are missing, the default for 'mips*-*-linux*' targets is
'--with-llsc'.  The '--with-llsc' and '--without-llsc' configure options
may be overridden at compile time by passing the '-mllsc' or '-mno-llsc'
options to the compiler.

   MIPS systems check for division by zero (unless
'-mno-check-zero-division' is passed to the compiler) by generating
either a conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using trap results in
smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and later.  Also, some
versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that prevents trap from
generating the proper signal ('SIGFPE').  To enable the use of break,
use the '--with-divide=breaks' 'configure' option when conPK
     cOnm4      	   1/1.z2196figuring GCC.
The default is to use traps on systems that support them.

   The assembler from GNU binutils 2.17 and earlier has a bug in the way
it sorts relocations for REL targets (o32, o64, EABI). This can cause
bad code to be generated for simple C++ programs.  Also the linker from
GNU binutils versions prior to 2.17 has a bug which causes the runtime
linker stubs in very large programs, like 'libgcj.so', to be incorrectly
generated.  GNU Binutils 2.18 and later (and snapshots made after Nov.
9, 2006) should be free from both of these problems.

*-*-solaris2*
=============

Support for Solaris 9 has been obsoleted in GCC 4.9, but can still be
enabled by configuring with '--enable-obsolete'.  Support will be
removed in GCC 4.10.  Support for Solaris 8 has removed in GCC 4.8.
Support for Solaris 7 has been removed in GCC 4.6.

   Sun does not ship a C compiler with Solaris 2 before Solaris 10,
though you can download the Sun Studio compilers for free.  In Solaris
10 and 11, GCC 3.4.3 is available as '/usr/sfw/bin/gcc'.  Solaris 11
also provides GCC 4.5.2 as '/usr/gcc/4.5/bin/gcc'.  Alternatively, you
can install a pre-built GCC to bootstrap and install GCC. See the
binaries page for details.

   The Solaris 2 '/bin/sh' will often fail to configure 'libstdc++-v3',
'boehm-gc' or 'libjava'.  We therefore recommend using the following
initial sequence of commands

     % CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/ksh
     % export CONFIG_SHELL

and proceed as described in the configure instructions.  In addition we
strongly recommend specifying an absolute path to invoke
'SRCDIR/configure'.

   Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these
are needed to use GCC fully, namely 'SUNWarc', 'SUNWbtool', 'SUNWesu',
'SUNWhea', 'SUNWlibm', 'SUNWsprot', and 'SUNWtoo'.  If you did not
install all optional packages when installing Solaris 2, you will need
to verify that the packages that GCC needs are installed.

   To check whether an optional package is installed, use the 'pkginfo'
command.  To add an optional package, use the 'pkgadd' command.  For
further details, see the Solaris 2 documentation.

   Trying to use the linker and other tools in '/usr/ucb' to install GCC
has been observed to cause trouble.  For example, the linker may hang
indefinitely.  The fix is to remove '/usr/ucb' from your 'PATH'.

   The build process works more smoothly with the legacy Sun tools so,
if you have '/usr/xpg4/bin' in your 'PATH', we recommend that you place
'/usr/bin' before '/usr/xpg4/bin' for the duration of the build.

   We recommend the use of the Sun assembler or the GNU assembler, in
conjunction with the Sun linker.  The GNU 'as' versions included in
Solaris 10, from GNU binutils 2.15, and Solaris 11, from GNU binutils
2.19, are known to work.  They can be found in '/usr/sfw/bin/gas'.
Current versions of GNU binutils (2.22) are known to work as well.  Note
that your mileage may vary if you use a combination of the GNU tools and
the Sun tools: while the combination GNU 'as' + Sun 'ld' should
reasonably work, the reverse combination Sun 'as' + GNU 'ld' may fail to
build or cause memory corruption at runtime in some cases for C++
programs.  GNU 'ld' usually works as well, although the version included
in Solaris 10 cannot be used due to several bugs.  Again, the current
version (2.22) is known to work, but generally lacks platform specific
features, so better stay with Sun 'ld'.  To use the LTO linker plugin
('-fuse-linker-plugin') with GNU 'ld', GNU binutils _must_ be configured
with '--enable-largefile'.

   To enable symbol versioning in 'libstdc++' with Sun 'ld', you need to
have any version of GNU 'c++filt', which is part of GNU binutils.
'libstdc++' symbol versioning will be disabled if no appropriate version
is found.  Sun 'c++filt' from the Sun Studio compilers does _not_ work.

   Sun bug 4296832 turns up when compiling X11 headers with GCC 2.95 or
newer: 'g++' will complain that types are missing.  These headers assume
that omitting the type means 'int'; this assumption worked for C90 but
is wrong for C++, and is now wrong for C99 also.

   Sun bug 4927647 sometimes causes random spurious testsuite failures
related to missing diagnostic output.  This bug doesn't affect GCC
itself, rather it is a kernel bug triggered by the 'expect' program
which is used only by the GCC testsuite driver.  When the bug causes the
'expect' program to miss anticipated output, extra testsuite failures
appear.

   There are patches for Solaris 9 (117171-11 or newer for SPARC,
117172-11 or newer for Intel) that address this problem.

   Thread-local storage (TLS) is supported in Solaris 9, but requires
some patches.  The 'libthread' patches provide the '__tls_get_addr'
(SPARC, 64-bit x86) resp. '___tls_get_addr' (32-bit x86) functions.  On
Solaris 9, the necessary support on SPARC is present since FCS, while
114432-05 or newer is required on Intel.  Additionally, on
Solaris 9/x86, patch 113986-02 or newer is required for the Sun 'ld' and
runtime linker ('ld.so.1') support, while Solaris 9/SPARC works since
FCS. The linker patches must be installed even if GNU 'ld' is used.  Sun
'as' in Solaris 9 doesn't support the necessary relocations, so GNU 'as'
must be used.  The 'configure' script checks for those prerequisites and
automatically enables TLS support if they are met.  Although those
minimal patch versions should work, it is recommended to use the latest
patch versions which include additional bug fixes.

sparc*-*-*
==========

This section contains general configuration information for all
SPARC-based platforms.  In addition to reading this section, please read
all other sections that match your target.

   Newer versions of the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP), the MPFR
library and the MPC library are known to be miscompiled by earlier
versions of GCC on these platforms.  We therefore recommend the use of
the exact versions of these libraries listed as minimal versions in the
prerequisites.

sparc-sun-solaris2*
===================

When GCC is configured to use GNU binutils 2.14 or later, the binaries
produced are smaller than the ones produced using Sun's native tools;
this difference is quite significant for binaries containing debugging
information.

   Starting with Solaris 7, the operating system is capable of executing
64-bit SPARC V9 binaries.  GCC 3.1 and later properly supports this; the
'-m64' option enables 64-bit code generation.  However, if all you want
is code tuned for the UltraSPARC CPU, you should try the
'-mtune=ultrasparc' option instead, which produces code that, unlike
full 64-bit code, can still run on non-UltraSPARC machines.

   When configuring on a Solaris 7 or later system that is running a
kernel that supports only 32-bit binaries, one must configure with
'--disable-multilib', since we will not be able to build the 64-bit
target libraries.

   GCC 3.3 and GCC 3.4 trigger code generation bugs in earlier versions
of the GNU compiler (especially GCC 3.0.x versions), which lead to the
miscompilation of the stage1 compiler and the subsequent failure of the
bootstrap process.  A workaround is to use GCC 3.2.3 as an intermediary
stage, i.e. to bootstrap that compiler with the base compiler and then
use it to bootstrap the final compiler.

   GCC 3.4 triggers a code generation bug in versions 5.4 (Sun ONE
Studio 7) and 5.5 (Sun ONE Studio 8) of the Sun compiler, which causes a
bootstrap failure in form of a miscompilation of the stage1 compiler by
the Sun compiler.  This is Sun bug 4974440.  This is fixed with patch
112760-07.

   GCC 3.4 changed the default debugging format from Stabs to DWARF-2
for 32-bit code on Solaris 7 and later.  If you use the Sun assembler,
this change apparently runs afoul of Sun bug 4910101 (which is
referenced as an x86-only problem by Sun, probably because they do not
use DWARF-2).  A symptom of the problem is that you cannot compile C++
programs like 'groff' 1.19.1 without getting messages similar to the
following:

     ld: warning: relocation error: R_SPARC_UA32: ...
       external symbolic relocation against non-allocatable section
       .debug_info cannot be processed at runtime: relocation ignored.

To work around this problem, compile with '-gstabs+' instead of plain
'-g'.

   When configuring the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP), the MPFR
library or the MPC library on a Solaris 7 or later system, the canonical
target triplet must be specified as the 'build' parameter on the
configure line.  This target triplet can be obtained by invoking
'./config.guess' in the toplevel source directory of GCC (and not that
of GMP or MPFR or MPC). For example on a Solaris 9 system:

     % ./configure --build=sparc-sun-solaris2.9 --prefix=xxx

sparc-sun-solaris2.10
=====================

There is a bug in older versions of the Sun assembler which breaks
thread-local storage (TLS). A typical error message is

     ld: fatal: relocation error: R_SPARC_TLS_LE_HIX22: file /var/tmp//ccamPA1v.o:
       symbol <unknown>: bad symbol type SECT: symbol type must be TLS

This bug is fixed in Sun patch 118683-03 or later.

sparc-*-linux*
==============

GCC versions 3.0 and higher require binutils 2.11.2 and glibc 2.2.4 or
newer on this platform.  All earlier binutils and glibc releases
mishandled unaligned relocations on 'sparc-*-*' targets.

sparc64-*-solaris2*
===================

When configuring the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP), the MPFR
library or the MPC library, the canonical target triplet must be
specified as the 'build' parameter on the configure line.  For example
on a Solaris 9 system:

     % ./configure --build=sparc64-sun-solaris2.9 --prefix=xxx

   The following compiler flags must be specified in the configure step
in order to bootstrap this target with the Sun compiler:

     % CC="cc -xarch=v9 -xildoff" SRCDIR/configure [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

'-xarch=v9' specifies the SPARC-V9 architecture to the Sun toolchain and
'-xildoff' turns off the incremental linker.

sparcv9-*-solaris2*
===================

This is a synonym for 'sparc64-*-solaris2*'.

c6x-*-*

The C6X family of processors.  This port requires binutils-2.22 or

port requires binutils-2.22 or newer.

tilegxbe-*-linux*
=================

The TILE-Gx processor in big endian mode, running GNU/Linux.  This port
requires binutils-2.23 or newer.

tilepro-*-linux*
================

The TILEPro processor running GNU/Linux.  This port requires
binutils-2.22 or newer.

*-*-vxworks*
============

Support for VxWorks is in flux.  At present GCC supports _only_ the very
recent VxWorks 5.5 (aka Tornado 2.2) release, and only on PowerPC.  We
welcome patches for other architectures supported by VxWorks 5.5.
Support for VxWorks AE would also be welcome; we believe this is merely
a matter of writing an appropriate "configlette" (see below).  We are
not interested in supporting older, a.out or COFF-based, versions of
VxWorks in GCC 3.

   VxWorks comes with an older version of GCC installed in
'$WIND_BASE/host'; we recommend you do not overwrite it.  Choose an
installation PREFIX entirely outside $WIND_BASE.  Before running
'configure', create the directories 'PREFIX' and 'PREFIX/bin'.  Link or
copy the appropriate assembler, linker, etc. into 'PREFIX/bin', and set
your PATH to include that directory while running both 'configure' and
'make'.

   You must give 'configure' the '--with-headers=$WIND_BASE/target/h'
switch so that it can find the VxWorks system headers.  Since VxWorks is
a cross compilation target only, you must also specify
'--target=TARGET'.  'configure' will attempt to create the directory
'PREFIX/TARGET/sys-include' and copy files into it; make sure the user
running 'configure' has sufficient privilege to do so.

   GCC's exception handling runtime requires a special "configlette"
module, 'contrib/gthr_supp_vxw_5x.c'.  Follow the instructions in that
file to add the module to your kernel build.  (Future versions of
VxWorks will incorporate this module.)

x86_64-*-*, amd64-*-*
=====================

GCC supports the x86-64 architecture implemented by the AMD64 processor
(amd64-*-* is an alias for x86_64-*-*) on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
On GNU/Linux the default is a bi-arch compiler which is able to generate
both 64-bit x86-64 and 32-bit x86 code (via the '-m32' switch).

x86_64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*
=========================

GCC also supports the x86-64 architecture implemented by the AMD64
processor ('amd64-*-*' is an alias for 'x86_64-*-*') on Solaris 10 or
later.  Unlike other systems, without special options a bi-arch compiler
is built which generates 32-bit code by default, but can generate 64-bit
x86-64 code with the '-m64' switch.  Since GCC 4.7, there is also
configuration that defaults to 64-bit code, but can generate 32-bit code
with '-m32'.  To configure and build this way, you have to provide all
support libraries like 'libgmp' as 64-bit code, configure with
'--target=x86_64-pc-solaris2.1x' and 'CC=gcc -m64'.

xtensa*-*-elf
=============

This target is intended for embedded Xtensa systems using the 'newlib' C
library.  It uses ELF but does not support shared objects.
Designed-defined instructions specified via the Tensilica Instruction
Extension (TIE) language are only supported through inline assembly.

   The Xtensa configuration information must be specified prior to
building GCC.  The 'include/xtensa-config.h' header file contains the
configuration information.  If you created your own Xtensa configuration
with the Xtensa Processor Generator, the downloaded files include a
customized copy of this header file, which you can use to replace the
default header file.

xtensa*-*-linux*
================

This target is for Xtensa systems running GNU/Linux.  It supports ELF
shared objects and the GNU C library (glibc).  It also generates
position-independent code (PIC) regardless of whether the '-fpic' or
'-fPIC' options are used.  In other respects, this target is the same as
the 'xtensa*-*-elf' target.

The 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows, such as Windows 3.1, are not
supported.

   However, the 32-bit port has limited support for Microsoft Windows
3.11 in the Win32s environment, as a target only.  See below.

Intel 32-bit versions
---------------------

The 32-bit versions of Windows, including Windows 95, Windows NT,
Windows XP, and Windows Vista, are supported by several different target
platforms.  These targets differ in which Windows subsystem they target
and which C libraries are used.

   * Cygwin *-*-cygwin: Cygwin provides a user-space Linux API emulation
     layer in the Win32 subsystem.
   * Interix *-*-interix: The Interix subsystem provides native support
     for POSIX.
   * MinGW *-*-mingw32: MinGW is a native GCC port for the Win32
     subsystem that provides a subset of POSIX.
   * MKS i386-pc-mks: NuTCracker from MKS. See
     <http://www.mkssoftware.com/> for more information.

Intel 64-bit versions
---------------------

GCC contains support for x86-64 using the mingw-w64 runtime library,
available from <http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/>.  This library should
be used with the target triple x86_64-pc-mingw32.

   Presently Windows for Itanium is not supported.

Windows CE
----------

Windows CE is supported as a target only on Hitachi SuperH
(sh-wince-pe), and MIPS (mips-wince-pe).

Other Windows Platforms
-----------------------

GCC no longer supports Windows NT on the Alpha or PowerPC.

   GCC no longer supports the Windows POSIX subsystem.  However, it does
support the Interix subsystem.  See above.

   Old target names including *-*-winnt and *-*-windowsnt are no longer
used.

   PW32 (i386-pc-pw32) support was never completed, and the project
seems to be inactive.  See <http://pw32.sourceforge.net/> for more
information.

   UWIN support has been removed due to a lack of maintenance.

*-*-cygwin
==========

Ports of GCC are included with the Cygwin environment.

   GCC will build under Cygwin without modification; it does not build
with Microsoft's C++ compiler and there are no plans to make it do so.

   The Cygwin native compiler can be configured to target any 32-bit x86
cpu architecture desired; the default is i686-pc-cygwin.  It should be
used with as up-to-date a version of binutils as possible; use either
the latest official GNU binutils release in the Cygwin distribution, or
version 2.20 or above if building your own.

*-*-interix
===========

The Interix target is used by OpenNT, Interix, Services For UNIX (SFU),
and Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA). Applications compiled
with this target run in the Interix subsystem, which is separate from
the Win32 subsystem.  This target was last known to work in GCC 3.3.

*-*-mingw32
===========

GCC will build with and support only MinGW runtime 3.12 and later.
Earlier versions of headers are incompatible with the new default
semantics of 'extern inline' in '-std=c99' and '-std=gnu99' modes.

Older systems
=============

GCC contains support files for many older (1980s and early 1990s) Unix
variants.  For the most part, support for these systems has not been
deliberately removed, but it has not been maintained for several years
and may suffer from bitrot.

   Starting with GCC 3.1, each release has a list of "obsoleted"
systems.  Support for these systems is still present in that release,
but 'configure' will fail unless the '--enable-obsolete' option is
given.  Unless a maintainer steps forward, support for these systems
will be removed from the next release of GCC.

   Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the
workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the
cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC.  In some cases, to
bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may
require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that
system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in the
vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in the
'old-releases' directory on the GCC mirror sites.  Header bugs may
generally be avoided using 'fixincludes', but bugs or deficiencies in
libraries and the operating system may still cause problems.

   Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less
problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an enthusiast
wishes to make such a target work again (including resurrecting any of
the targets that never worked with GCC 2, starting from the last version
before they were removed), patches following the usual requirements
would be likely to be accepted, since they should not affect the support
for more modern targets.

   For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful,
and are available from 'pub/binutils/old-releases' on sourceware.org
mirror sites.

   Some of the information on specific systems above relates to such
older systems, but much of the information about GCC on such systems
(which may no longer be applicable to current GCC) is to be found in the
GCC texinfo manual.

all ELF targets (SVR4, Solaris 2, etc.)
=======================================

C++ support is significantly better on ELF targets if you use the GNU
linker; duplicate copies of inlines, vtables and template instantiations
will be discarded automatically.

10 Old installation documentation
*********************************

Note most of this information is out of date and superseded by the
previous chapters of this manual.  It is provided for historical
reference only, because of a lack of volunteers to merge it into the
main manual.

* Menu:

* Configurations::    Configurations Supported by GCC.

   Here is the procedure for installing GCC on a GNU or Unix system.

  1. If you have chosen a configuration for GCC which requires other GNU
     tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard
     system tools, install the required tools in the build directory
     under the names 'as', 'ld' or whatever is appropriate.

     Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of
     the 'PATH' environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools
     come before the standard system tools.

  2. Specify the host, build and target machine configurations.  You do
     this when you run the 'configure' script.

     The "build" machine is the system which you are using, the "host"
     machine is the system where you want to run the resulting compiler
     (normally the build machine), and the "target" machine is the
     system for which you want the compiler to generate code.

     If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it
     runs on (a native compiler), you normally do not need to specify
     any operands to 'configure'; it will try to guess the type of
     machine you are on and use that as the build, host and target
     machines.  So you don't need to specify a configuration when
     building a native compiler unless 'configure' cannot figure out
     what your configuration is or guesses wrong.

     In those cases, specify the build machine's "configuration name"
     with the '--host' option; the host and target will default to be
     the same as the host machine.

     Here is an example:

          ./configure --host=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

     A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
     abbreviated.

     A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by
     dashes.  It looks like this: 'CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM'.  (The three
     parts may themselves contain dashes; 'configure' can figure out
     which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
     'm68k-sun-sunos4.1' specifies a Sun 3.

     You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or
     aliases.  For example, 'sun3' stands for 'm68k-sun', so
     'sun3-sunos4.1' is another way to specify a Sun 3.

     You can specify a version number after any of the system types, and
     some of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is irrelevant,
     and will be ignored.  So you might as well specify the version if
     you know it.

     See *note Configurations::, for a list of supported configuration
     names and notes on many of the configurations.  You should check
     the notes in that section before proceeding any further with the
     installation of GCC.


File: gccinstall.info,  Node: Configurations,  Up: Old

10.1 Configurations Supported by GCC
====================================

Here are the possible CPU types:

     1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, avr, cN, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, fr30,
     h8300, hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i586, i686, i786, i860,
     i960, ip2k, m32r, m68000, m68k, m88k, mcore, mips, mipsel, mips64,
     mips64el, mn10200, mn10300, ns32k, pdp11, powerpc, powerpcle, romp,
     rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite, sparc64, v850, vax, we32k.

   Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

     acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, apple, att, bull, cbm, convergent,
     convex, crds, dec, dg, dolphin, elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi, hp,
     ibm, intergraph, isi, mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron, plexus,
     sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom, wrs.

   The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing just
'CPU-SYSTEM', if it is not needed.  For example, 'vax-ultrix4.2' is
equivalent to 'vax-dec-ultrix4.2'.

   Here is a list of system types:

     386bsd, aix, acis, amigaos, aos, aout, aux, bosx, bsd, clix, coff,
     ctix, cxux, dgux, dynix, ebmon, ecoff, elf, esix, freebsd, hms,
     genix, gnu, linux, linux-gnu, hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna,
     lynxos, mach, minix, msdos, mvs, netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf,
     osfrose, ptx, riscix, riscos, rtu, sco, sim, solaris, sunos, sym,
     sysv, udi, ultrix, unicos, uniplus, unos, vms, vsta, vxworks,
     winnt, xenix.

You can omit the system type; then 'configure' guesses the operating
system from the CPU and company.

   You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write 'bsd4.3' or 'bsd4.4' to
distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version number is most
needed for 'sysv3' and 'sysv4', which are often treated differently.

   'linux-gnu' is the canonical name for the GNU/Linux target; however
GCC will also accept 'linux'.  The version of the kernel in use is not
relevant on these systems.  A suffix such as 'libc1' or 'aout'
distinguishes major versions of the C library; all of the suffixed
versions are obsolete.

   If you specify an impossible combination such as 'i860-dg-vms', then
you may get an error message from 'configure', or it may ignore part of
the information and do the best it can with the rest.  'configure'
always prints the canonical name for the alternative that it used.  GCC
does not support all possible alternatives.

   Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names
are recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the
machine name 'sun3', mentioned above, is an alias for 'm68k-sun'.
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

     3300, 3b1, 3bN, 7300, altos3068, altos, apollo68, att-7300,
     balance, convex-cN, crds, decstation-3100, decstation, delta,
     encore, fx2800, gmicro, hp7NN, hp8NN, hp9k2NN, hp9k3NN, hp9k7NN,
     hp9k8NN, iris4d, iris, isi68, m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
     mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next, pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc,
     powerpcle, ps2, risc-news, rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3, sun4,
     symmetry, tower-32, tower.

Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name.

GNU Free Documentation License
******************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

Introduction
************

This manual documents the internals of the GNU compilers, including how
to port them to new targets and some information about how to write
front ends for new languages.  It corresponds to the compilers (tdm64-1)
version 4.9.2.  The use of the GNU compilers is documented in a separate
manual.  *Note Introduction: (gcc)Top.

 This manual is mainly a reference manual rather than a tutorial.  It
discusses how to contribute to GCC (*note Contributing::), the
characteristics of the machines supported by GCC as hosts and targets
(*note Portability::), how GCC relates to the ABIs on such systems
(*note Interface::), and the characteristics of the languages for which
GCC front ends are written (*note Languages::).  It then describes the
GCC source tree structure and build system, some of the interfaces to
GCC front ends, and how support for a target system is implemented in
GCC.

 Additional tutorial information is linked to from
<http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html>.

1 Contributing to GCC Development
*********************************

If you would like to help pretest GCC releases to assure they work well,
current development sources are available by SVN (see
<http://gcc.gnu.org/svn.html>).  Source and binary snapshots are also
available for FTP; see <http://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html>.

 If you would like to work on improvements to GCC, please read the
advice at these URLs:

     <http://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html>
     <http://gcc.gnu.org/contributewhy.html>

for information on how to make useful contributions and avoid
duplication of effort.  Suggested projects are listed at
<http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/>.

2 GCC and Portability
*********************

GCC itself aims to be portable to any machine where 'int' is at least a
32-bit type.  It aims to target machines with a flat (non-segmented)
byte addressed data address space (the code address space can be
separate).  Target ABIs may have 8, 16, 32 or 64-bit 'int' type.  'char'
can be wider than 8 bits.

 GCC gets most of the information about the target machine from a
machine description which gives an algebraic formula for each of the
machine's instructions.  This is a very clean way to describe the
target.  But when the compiler needs information that is difficult to
express in this fashion, ad-hoc parameters have been defined for machine
descriptions.  The purpose of portability is to reduce the total work
needed on the compiler; it was not of interest for its own sake.

 GCC does not contain machine dependent code, but it does contain code
that depends on machine parameters such as endianness (whether the most
significant byte has the highest or lowest address of the bytes in a
word) and the availability of autoincrement addressing.  In the
RTL-generation pass, it is often necessary to have multiple strategies
for generating code for a particular kind of syntax tree, strategies
that are usable for different combinations of parameters.  Often, not
all possible cases have been addressed, but only the common ones or only
the ones that have been encountered.  As a result, a new target may
require additional strategies.  You will know if this happens because
the compiler will call 'abort'.  Fortunately, the new strategies can be
added in a machine-independent fashion, and will affect only the target
machines that need them.

3 Interfacing to GCC Output
***************************

GCC is normally configured to use the same function calling convention
normally in use on the target system.  This is done with the
machine-description macros described (*note Target Macros::).

 However, returning of structure and union values is done differently on
some target machines.  As a result, functions compiled with PCC
returning such types cannot be called from code compiled with GCC, and
vice versa.  This does not cause trouble often because few Unix library
routines return structures or unions.

 GCC code returns structures and unions that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long
in the same registers used for 'int' or 'double' return values.  (GCC
typically allocates variables of such types in registers also.)
Structures and unions of other sizes are returned by storing them into
an address passed by the caller (usually in a register).  The target
hook 'TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' tells GCC where to pass this address.

 By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value.
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  This is slower than the method used by GCC, and
fails to be reentrant.

 On some target machines, such as RISC machines and the 80386, the
standard system convention is to pass to the subroutine the address of
where to return the value.  On these machines, GCC has been configured
to be compatible with the standard compiler, when this method is used.
It may not be compatible for structures of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.

 GCC uses the system's standard convention for passing arguments.  On
some machines, the first few arguments are passed in registers; in
others, all are passed on the stack.  It would be possible to use
registers for argument passing on any machine, and this would probably
result in a significant speedup.  But the result would be complete
incompatibility with code that follows the standard convention.  So this
change is practical only if you are switching to GCC as the sole C
compiler for the system.  We may implement register argument passing on
certain machines once we have a complete GNU system so that we can
compile the libraries with GCC.

 On some machines (particularly the SPARC), certain types of arguments
are passed "by invisible reference".  This means that the value is
stored in memory, and the address of the memory location is passed to
the subroutine.

 If you use 'longjmp', beware of automatic variables.  ISO C says that
automatic variables that are not declared 'volatile' have undefined
values after a 'longjmp'.  And this is all GCC promises to do, because
it is very difficult to restore register variables correctly, and one of
GCC's features is that it can put variables in registers without your
asking it to.

4 The GCC low-level runtime library
***********************************

GCC provides a low-level runtime library, 'libgcc.a' or 'libgcc_s.so.1'
on some platforms.  GCC generates calls to routines in this library
automatically, whenever it needs to perform some operation that is too
complicated to emit inline code for.

 Most of the routines in 'libgcc' handle arithmetic operations that the
target processor cannot perform directly.  This includes integer
multiply and divide on some machines, and all floating-point and
fixed-point operations on other machines.  'libgcc' also includes
routines for exception handling, and a handful of miscellaneous
operations.

 Some of these routines can be defined in mostly machine-independent C.
Others must be hand-written in assembly language for each processor that
needs them.

 GCC will also generate calls to C library routines, such as 'memcpy'
and 'memset', in some cases.  The set of routines that GCC may possibly
use is documented in *note (gcc)Other Builtins::.

 These routines take arguments and return values of a specific machine
mode, not a specific C type.  *Note Machine Modes::, for an explanation
of this concept.  For illustrative purposes, in this chapter the
floating point type 'float' is assumed to correspond to 'SFmode';
'double' to 'DFmode'; and 'long double' to both 'TFmode' and 'XFmode'.
Similarly, the integer types 'int' and 'unsigned int' correspond to
'SImode'; 'long' and 'unsigned long' to 'DImode'; and 'long long' and
'unsigned long long' to 'TImode'.

4.2 Routines for floating point emulation
=========================================

The software floating point library is used on machines which do not
have hardware support for floating point.  It is also used whenever
'-msoft-float' is used to disable generation of floating point
instructions.  (Not all targets support this switch.)

 For compatibility with other compilers, the floating point emulation
routines can be renamed with the 'DECLARE_LIBRARY_RENAMES' macro (*note
Library Calls::).  In this section, the default names are used.

4.2.3 Comparison functions
--------------------------

There are two sets of basic comparison functions.

 -- Runtime Function: int __cmpsf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __cmpdf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __cmptf2 (long double A, long double B)
     These functions calculate a <=> b.  That is, if A is less than B,
     they return -1; if A is greater than B, they return 1; and if A and
     B are equal they return 0.  If either argument is NaN they return
     1, but you should not rely on this; if NaN is a possibility, use
     one of the higher-level comparison functions.

 -- Runtime Function: int __unordsf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __unorddf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __unordtf2 (long double A, long double B)
     These functions return a nonzero value if either argument is NaN,
     otherwise 0.

 There is also a complete group of higher level functions which
correspond directly to comparison operators.  They implement the ISO C
semantics for floating-point comparisons, taking NaN into account.  Pay
careful attention to the return values defined for each set.  Under the
hood, all of these routines are implemented as

       if (__unordXf2 (a, b))
         return E;
       return __cmpXf2 (a, b);

where E is a constant chosen to give the proper behavior for NaN.  Thus,
the meaning of the return value is different for each set.  Do not rely
on this implementation; only the semantics documented below are
guaranteed.

 -- Runtime Function: int __eqsf2 (float A, float B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __eqdf2 (double A, double B)

     are equal.

 -- Runtime Function: int __gedf2 (double A, double B)
 -- Runtime Function: int __getf2 (long double A, long double B)

     neither argument is NaN, and A is greater than or equal to B.

     argument is NaN, and A is strictly greater than B.

     + iB) / (C + iD)), following the rules of C99 Annex G.

     otherwise 0.

 There is also a complete group of higher level functions which
correspond directly to comparison operators.  They implement the ISO C
semantics for floating-point comparisons, taking NaN into account.  Pay
careful attention to the return values defined for each set.  Under the
hood, all of these routines are implemented as

       if (__bid_unordXd2 (a, b))
         return E;
       return __bid_cmpXd2 (a, b);

where E is a constant chosen to give the proper behavior for NaN.  Thus,
the meaning of the return value is different for each set.  Do not rely
on this implementation; only the semantics documented below are
guaranteed.

4.4 Routines for fixed-point fractional emulation
=================================================

The software fixed-point library implements fixed-point fractional
arithmetic, and is only activated on selected targets.

 For ease of comprehension 'fract' is an alias for the '_Fract' type,
'accum' an alias for '_Accum', and 'sat' an alias for '_Sat'.

 For illustrative purposes, in this section the fixed-point fractional
type 'short fract' is assumed to correspond to machine mode 'QQmode';
'unsigned short fract' to 'UQQmode'; 'fract' to 'HQmode';
'unsigned fract' to 'UHQmode'; 'long fract' to 'SQmode';
'unsigned long fract' to 'USQmode'; 'long long fract' to 'DQmode'; and
'unsigned long long fract' to 'UDQmode'.  Similarly the fixed-point
accumulator type 'short accum' corresponds to 'HAmode';
'unsigned short accum' to 'UHAmode'; 'accum' to 'SAmode';
'unsigned accum' to 'USAmode'; 'long accum' to 'DAmode';
'unsigned long accum' to 'UDAmode'; 'long long accum' to 'TAmode'; and
'unsigned long long accum' to 'UTAmode'.

4.4.2 Comparison functions
--------------------------

The following functions implement fixed-point comparisons.  These
functions implement a low-level compare, upon which the higher level
comparison operators (such as less than and greater than or equal to)
can be constructed.  The returned values lie in the range zero to two,
to allow the high-level operators to be implemented by testing the
returned result using either signed or unsigned comparison.

          unsigned long long accum B)
     These functions perform a signed or unsigned comparison of A and B
     (depending on the selected machine mode).  If A is less than B,
     they return 0; if A is greater than B, they return 2; and if A and
     B are equal they return 1.

4.6 Miscellaneous runtime library routines
==========================================

4.6.1 Cache control functions
-----------------------------

 -- Runtime Function: void __clear_cache (char *BEG, char *END)
     This function clears the instruction cache between BEG and END.

4.6.2 Split stack functions and variables
-----------------------------------------

 -- Runtime Function: void * __splitstack_find (void *SEGMENT_ARG, void
          *SP, size_t LEN, void **NEXT_SEGMENT, void **NEXT_SP, void
          **INITIAL_SP)
     When using '-fsplit-stack', this call may be used to iterate over
     the stack segments.  It may be called like this:
            void *next_segment = NULL;
            void *next_sp = NULL;
            void *initial_sp = NULL;
            void *stack;
            size_t stack_size;
            while ((stack = __splitstack_find (next_segment, next_sp,
                                               &stack_size, &next_segment,
                                               &next_sp, &initial_sp))
                   != NULL)
              {
                /* Stack segment starts at stack and is
                   stack_size bytes long.  */
              }

     There is no way to iterate over the stack segments of a different
     thread.  However, what is permitted is for one thread to call this
     with the SEGMENT_ARG and SP arguments NULL, to pass NEXT_SEGMENT,
     NEXT_SP, and INITIAL_SP to a different thread, and then to suspend
     one way or another.  A different thread may run the subsequent
     '__splitstack_find' iterations.  Of course, this will only work if
     the first thread is suspended while the second thread is calling
     '__splitstack_find'.  If not, the second thread could be looking at
     the stack while it is changing, and anything could happen.

 -- Variable: __morestack_segments
 -- Variable: __morestack_current_segment
 -- Variable: __morestack_initial_sp
     Internal variables used by the '-fsplit-stack' implementation.

5 Language Front Ends in GCC
****************************

The interface to front ends for languages in GCC, and in particular the
'tree' structure (*note GENERIC::), was initially designed for C, and
many aspects of it are still somewhat biased towards C and C-like
languages.  It is, however, reasonably well suited to other procedural
languages, and front ends for many such languages have been written for
GCC.

 Writing a compiler as a front end for GCC, rather than compiling
directly to assembler or generating C code which is then compiled by
GCC, has several advantages:

   * GCC front ends benefit from the support for many different target
     machines already present in GCC.
   * GCC front ends benefit from all the optimizations in GCC.  Some of
     these, such as alias analysis, may work better when GCC is
     compiling directly from source code then when it is compiling from
     generated C code.
   * Better debugging information is generated when compiling directly
     from source code than when going via intermediate generated C code.

 Because of the advantages of writing a compiler as a GCC front end, GCC
front ends have also been created for languages very different from
those for which GCC was designed, such as the declarative
logic/functional language Mercury.  For these reasons, it may also be
useful to implement compilers created for specialized purposes (for
example, as part of a research project) as GCC front ends.

6 Source Tree Structure and Build System
****************************************

This chapter describes the structure of the GCC source tree, and how GCC
is built.  The user documentation for building and installing GCC is in
a separate manual (<http://gcc.gnu.org/install/>), with which it is
presumed that you are familiar.

* Menu:

* Configure Terms:: Configuration terminology and history.
* Top Level::       The top level source directory.
* gcc Directory::   The 'gcc' subdirectory.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Configure Terms,  Next: Top Level,  Up: Source Tree

6.1 Configure Terms and History
===============================

The configure and build process has a long and colorful history, and can
be confusing to anyone who doesn't know why things are the way they are.
While there are other documents which describe the configuration process
in detail, here are a few things that everyone working on GCC should
know.

 There are three system names that the build knows about: the machine
you are building on ("build"), the machine that you are building for
("host"), and the machine that GCC will produce code for ("target").
When you configure GCC, you specify these with '--build=', '--host=',
and '--target='.

 Specifying the host without specifying the build should be avoided, as
'configure' may (and once did) assume that the host you specify is also
the build, which may not be true.

 If build, host, and target are all the same, this is called a "native".
If build and host are the same but target is different, this is called a
"cross".  If build, host, and target are all different this is called a
"canadian" (for obscure reasons dealing with Canada's political party
and the background of the person working on the build at that time).  If
host and target are the same, but build is different, you are using a
cross-compiler to build a native for a different system.  Some people
call this a "host-x-host", "crossed native", or "cross-built native".
If build and target are the same, but host is different, you are using a
cross compiler to build a cross compiler that produces code for the
machine you're building on.  This is rare, so there is no common way of
describing it.  There is a proposal to call this a "crossback".

 If build and host are the same, the GCC you are building will also be
used to build the target libraries (like 'libstdc++').  If build and
host are different, you must have already built and installed a cross
compiler that will be used to build the target libraries (if you
configured with '--target=foo-bar', this compiler will be called
'foo-bar-gcc').

 In the case of target libraries, the machine you're building for is the
machine you specified with '--target'.  So, build is the machine you're
building on (no change there), host is the machine you're building for
(the target libraries are built for the target, so host is the target
you specified), and target doesn't apply (because you're not building a
compiler, you're building libraries).  The configure/make process will
adjust these variables as needed.  It also sets '$with_cross_host' to
the original '--host' value in case you need it.

 The 'libiberty' support library is built up to three times: once for
the host, once for the target (even if they are the same), and once for
the build if build and host are different.  This allows it to be used by
all programs which are generated in the course of the build process.

6.2 Top Level Source Directory
==============================

The top level source directory in a GCC distribution contains several
files and directories that are shared with other software distributions
such as that of GNU Binutils.  It also contains several subdirectories
that contain parts of GCC and its runtime libraries:

'boehm-gc'
     The Boehm conservative garbage collector, used as part of the Java
     runtime library.

'config'
     Autoconf macros and Makefile fragments used throughout the tree.

'contrib'
     Contributed scripts that may be found useful in conjunction with
     GCC.  One of these, 'contrib/texi2pod.pl', is used to generate man
     pages from Texinfo manuals as part of the GCC build process.

'fixincludes'
     The support for fixing system headers to work with GCC.  See
     'fixincludes/README' for more information.  The headers fixed by
     this mechanism are installed in 'LIBSUBDIR/include-fixed'.  Along
     with those headers, 'README-fixinc' is also installed, as
     'LIBSUBDIR/include-fixed/README'.

'gcc'
     The main sources of GCC itself (except for runtime libraries),
     including optimizers, support for different target architectures,
     language front ends, and testsuites.  *Note The 'gcc' Subdirectory:
     gcc Directory, for details.

'gnattools'
     Support tools for GNAT.

'include'
     Headers for the 'libiberty' library.

'intl'
     GNU 'libintl', from GNU 'gettext', for systems which do not include
     it in 'libc'.

'libada'
     The Ada runtime library.

'libatomic'
     The runtime support library for atomic operations (e.g.  for
     '__sync' and '__atomic').

'libcpp'
     The C preprocessor library.

'libdecnumber'
     The Decimal Float support library.

'libffi'
     The 'libffi' library, used as part of the Java runtime library.

'libgcc'
     The GCC runtime library.

'libgfortran'
     The Fortran runtime library.

'libgo'
     The Go runtime library.  The bulk of this library is mirrored from
     the master Go repository (http://code.google.com/p/go/).

'libgomp'
     The GNU OpenMP runtime library.

'libiberty'
     The 'libiberty' library, used for portability and for some
     generally useful data structures and algorithms.  *Note
     Introduction: (libiberty)Top, for more information about this
     library.

'libitm'
     The runtime support library for transactional memory.

'libjava'
     The Java runtime library.

'libobjc'
     The Objective-C and Objective-C++ runtime library.

'libquadmath'
     The runtime support library for quad-precision math operations.

'libssp'
     The Stack protector runtime library.

'libstdc++-v3'
     The C++ runtime library.

'lto-plugin'
     Plugin used by the linker if link-time optimizations are enabled.

'maintainer-scripts'
     Scripts used by the 'gccadmin' account on 'gcc.gnu.org'.

'zlib'
     The 'zlib' compression library, used by the Java front end, as part
     of the Java runtime library, and for compressing and uncompressing
     GCC's intermediate language in LTO object files.

 The build system in the top level directory, including how recursion
into subdirectories works and how building runtime libraries for
multilibs is handled, is documented in a separate manual, included with
GNU Binutils.  *Note GNU configure and build system: (configure)Top, for
details.

6.3 The 'gcc' Subdirectory
==========================

The 'gcc' directory contains many files that are part of the C sources
of GCC, other files used as part of the configuration and build process,
and subdirectories including documentation and a testsuite.  The files
that are sources of GCC are documented in a separate chapter.  *Note
Passes and Files of the Compiler: Passes.

* Library Files::  Library source files and headers under 'gcc/'.
* Headers::        Headers installed by GCC.
* Documentation::  Building documentation in GCC.
* Front End::      Anatomy of a language front end.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Subdirectories,  Next: Configuration,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.1 Subdirectories of 'gcc'
-----------------------------

The 'gcc' directory contains the following subdirectories:

'LANGUAGE'
     Subdirectories for various languages.  Directories containing a
     file 'config-lang.in' are language subdirectories.  The contents of
     the subdirectories 'c' (for C), 'cp' (for C++), 'objc' (for
     Objective-C), 'objcp' (for Objective-C++), and 'lto' (for LTO) are
     documented in this manual (*note Passes and Files of the Compiler:
     Passes.); those for other languages are not.  *Note Anatomy of a
     Language Front End: Front End, for details of the files in these
     directories.

'common'
     Source files shared between the compiler drivers (such as 'gcc')
     and the compilers proper (such as 'cc1').  If an architecture
     defines target hooks shared between those places, it also has a
     subdirectory in 'common/config'.  *Note Target Structure::.

'config'
     Configuration files for supported architectures and operating
     systems.  *Note Anatomy of a Target Back End: Back End, for details
     of the files in this directory.

'doc'
     Texinfo documentation for GCC, together with automatically
     generated man pages and support for converting the installation
     manual to HTML.  *Note Documentation::.

'ginclude'
     System headers installed by GCC, mainly those required by the C
     standard of freestanding implementations.  *Note Headers Installed
     by GCC: Headers, for details of when these and other headers are
     installed.

'po'
     Message catalogs with translations of messages produced by GCC into
     various languages, 'LANGUAGE.po'.  This directory also contains
     'gcc.pot', the template for these message catalogues, 'exgettext',
     a wrapper around 'gettext' to extract the messages from the GCC
     sources and create 'gcc.pot', which is run by 'make gcc.pot', and
     'EXCLUDES', a list of files from which messages should not be
     extracted.

'testsuite'
     The GCC testsuites (except for those for runtime libraries).  *Note
     Testsuites::.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Build,  Prev: Subdirectories,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.2 Configuration in the 'gcc' Directory
------------------------------------------

The 'gcc' directory is configured with an Autoconf-generated script
'configure'.  The 'configure' script is generated from 'configure.ac'
and 'aclocal.m4'.  From the files 'configure.ac' and 'acconfig.h',
Autoheader generates the file 'config.in'.  The file 'cstamp-h.in' is
used as a timestamp.

* Menu:

* Config Fragments::     Scripts used by 'configure'.
* System Config::        The 'config.build', 'config.host', and
                         'config.gcc' files.
* Configuration Files::  Files created by running 'configure'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Config Fragments,  Next: System Config,  Up: Configuration

6.3.2.1 Scripts Used by 'configure'
...................................

'configure' uses some other scripts to help in its work:

   * The standard GNU 'config.sub' and 'config.guess' files, kept in the
     top level directory, are used.

   * The file 'config.gcc' is used to handle configuration specific to
     the particular target machine.  The file 'config.build' is used to
     handle configuration specific to the particular build machine.  The
     file 'config.host' is used to handle configuration specific to the
     particular host machine.  (In general, these should only be used
     for features that cannot reasonably be tested in Autoconf feature
     tests.)  *Note The 'config.build'; 'config.host'; and 'config.gcc'
     Files: System Config, for details of the contents of these files.

   * Each language subdirectory has a file 'LANGUAGE/config-lang.in'
     that is used for front-end-specific configuration.  *Note The Front
     End 'config-lang.in' File: Front End Config, for details of this
     file.

   * A helper script 'configure.frag' is used as part of creating the
     output of 'configure'.

6.3.2.2 The 'config.build'; 'config.host'; and 'config.gcc' Files
.................................................................

The 'config.build' file contains specific rules for particular systems
which GCC is built on.  This should be used as rarely as possible, as
the behavior of the build system can always be detected by autoconf.

 The 'config.host' file contains specific rules for particular systems
which GCC will run on.  This is rarely needed.

 The 'config.gcc' file contains specific rules for particular systems
which GCC will generate code for.  This is usually needed.

 Each file has a list of the shell variables it sets, with descriptions,
at the top of the file.

 FIXME: document the contents of these files, and what variables should
be set to control build, host and target configuration.

6.3.2.3 Files Created by 'configure'
....................................

Here we spell out what files will be set up by 'configure' in the 'gcc'
directory.  Some other files are created as temporary files in the
configuration process, and are not used in the subsequent build; these
are not documented.

   * 'Makefile' is constructed from 'Makefile.in', together with the
     host and target fragments (*note Makefile Fragments: Fragments.)
     't-TARGET' and 'x-HOST' from 'config', if any, and language
     Makefile fragments 'LANGUAGE/Make-lang.in'.
   * 'auto-host.h' contains information about the host machine
     determined by 'configure'.  If the host machine is different from
     the build machine, then 'auto-build.h' is also created, containing
     such information about the build machine.
   * 'config.status' is a script that may be run to recreate the current
     configuration.
   * 'configargs.h' is a header containing details of the arguments
     passed to 'configure' to configure GCC, and of the thread model
     used.
   * 'cstamp-h' is used as a timestamp.
   * If a language 'config-lang.in' file (*note The Front End
     'config-lang.in' File: Front End Config.) sets 'outputs', then the
     files listed in 'outputs' there are also generated.

 The following configuration headers are created from the Makefile,
using 'mkconfig.sh', rather than directly by 'configure'.  'config.h',
'bconfig.h' and 'tconfig.h' all contain the 'xm-MACHINE.h' header, if
any, appropriate to the host, build and target machines respectively,
the configuration headers for the target, and some definitions; for the
host and build machines, these include the autoconfigured headers
generated by 'configure'.  The other configuration headers are
determined by 'config.gcc'.  They also contain the typedefs for 'rtx',
'rtvec' and 'tree'.

   * 'config.h', for use in programs that run on the host machine.
   * 'bconfig.h', for use in programs that run on the build machine.
   * 'tconfig.h', for use in programs and libraries for the target
     machine.
   * 'tm_p.h', which includes the header 'MACHINE-protos.h' that
     contains prototypes for functions in the target 'MACHINE.c' file.
     The header 'MACHINE-protos.h' can include prototypes of functions
     that use rtl and tree data structures inside appropriate '#ifdef
     RTX_CODE' and '#ifdef TREE_CODE' conditional code segements.  The
     'MACHINE-protos.h' is included after the 'rtl.h' and/or 'tree.h'
     would have been included.  The 'tm_p.h' also includes the header
     'tm-preds.h' which is generated by 'genpreds' program during the
     build to define the declarations and inline functions for the
     predicate functions.

6.3.3 Build System in the 'gcc' Directory
-----------------------------------------

FIXME: describe the build system, including what is built in what
stages.  Also list the various source files that are used in the build
process but aren't source files of GCC itself and so aren't documented
below (*note Passes::).


File: gccint.info,  Node: Makefile,  Next: Library Files,  Prev: Build,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.4 Makefile Targets
----------------------

These targets are available from the 'gcc' directory:

'all'
     This is the default target.  Depending on what your
     build/host/target configuration is, it coordinates all the things
     that need to be built.

'doc'
     Produce info-formatted documentation and man pages.  Essentially it
     calls 'make man' and 'make info'.

'dvi'
     Produce DVI-formatted documentation.

'pdf'
     Produce PDF-formatted documentation.

'html'
     Produce HTML-formatted documentation.

'man'
     Generate man pages.

'info'
     Generate info-formatted pages.

'mostlyclean'
     Delete the files made while building the compiler.

'clean'
     That, and all the other files built by 'make all'.

'distclean'
     That, and all the files created by 'configure'.

'maintainer-clean'
     Distclean plus any file that can be generated from other files.
     Note that additional tools may be required beyond what is normally
     needed to build GCC.

'srcextra'
     Generates files in the source directory that are not
     version-controlled but should go into a release tarball.

'srcinfo'
'srcman'
     Copies the info-formatted and manpage documentation into the source
     directory usually for the purpose of generating a release tarball.

'install'
     Installs GCC.

'uninstall'
     Deletes installed files, though this is not supported.

'check'
     Run the testsuite.  This creates a 'testsuite' subdirectory that
     has various '.sum' and '.log' files containing the results of the
     testing.  You can run subsets with, for example, 'make check-gcc'.
     You can specify specific tests by setting 'RUNTESTFLAGS' to be the
     name of the '.exp' file, optionally followed by (for some tests) an
     equals and a file wildcard, like:

          make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp=19980413-*"

     Note that running the testsuite may require additional tools be
     installed, such as Tcl or DejaGnu.

 The toplevel tree from which you start GCC compilation is not the GCC
directory, but rather a complex Makefile that coordinates the various
steps of the build, including bootstrapping the compiler and using the
new compiler to build target libraries.

 When GCC is configured for a native configuration, the default action
for 'make' is to do a full three-stage bootstrap.  This means that GCC
is built three times--once with the native compiler, once with the
native-built compiler it just built, and once with the compiler it built
the second time.  In theory, the last two should produce the same
results, which 'make compare' can check.  Each stage is configured
separately and compiled into a separate directory, to minimize problems
due to ABI incompatibilities between the native compiler and GCC.

 If you do a change, rebuilding will also start from the first stage and
"bubble" up the change through the three stages.  Each stage is taken
from its build directory (if it had been built previously), rebuilt, and
copied to its subdirectory.  This will allow you to, for example,
continue a bootstrap after fixing a bug which causes the stage2 build to
crash.  It does not provide as good coverage of the compiler as
bootstrapping from scratch, but it ensures that the new code is
syntactically correct (e.g., that you did not use GCC extensions by
mistake), and avoids spurious bootstrap comparison failures(1).

 Other targets available from the top level include:

'bootstrap-lean'
     Like 'bootstrap', except that the various stages are removed once
     they're no longer needed.  This saves disk space.

'bootstrap2'
'bootstrap2-lean'
     Performs only the first two stages of bootstrap.  Unlike a
     three-stage bootstrap, this does not perform a comparison to test
     that the compiler is running properly.  Note that the disk space
     required by a "lean" bootstrap is approximately independent of the
     number of stages.

'stageN-bubble (N = 1...4, profile, feedback)'
     Rebuild all the stages up to N, with the appropriate flags,
     "bubbling" the changes as described above.

'all-stageN (N = 1...4, profile, feedback)'
     Assuming that stage N has already been built, rebuild it with the
     appropriate flags.  This is rarely needed.

'cleanstrap'
     Remove everything ('make clean') and rebuilds ('make bootstrap').

'compare'
     Compares the results of stages 2 and 3.  This ensures that the
     compiler is running properly, since it should produce the same
     object files regardless of how it itself was compiled.

'profiledbootstrap'
     Builds a compiler with profiling feedback information.  In this
     case, the second and third stages are named 'profile' and
     'feedback', respectively.  For more information, see *note Building
     with profile feedback: (gccinstall)Building.

'restrap'
     Restart a bootstrap, so that everything that was not built with the
     system compiler is rebuilt.

'stageN-start (N = 1...4, profile, feedback)'
     For each package that is bootstrapped, rename directories so that,
     for example, 'gcc' points to the stageN GCC, compiled with the
     stageN-1 GCC(2).

     You will invoke this target if you need to test or debug the stageN
     GCC.  If you only need to execute GCC (but you need not run 'make'
     either to rebuild it or to run test suites), you should be able to
     work directly in the 'stageN-gcc' directory.  This makes it easier
     to debug multiple stages in parallel.

'stage'
     For each package that is bootstrapped, relocate its build directory
     to indicate its stage.  For example, if the 'gcc' directory points
     to the stage2 GCC, after invoking this target it will be renamed to
     'stage2-gcc'.

 If you wish to use non-default GCC flags when compiling the stage2 and
stage3 compilers, set 'BOOT_CFLAGS' on the command line when doing
'make'.

 Usually, the first stage only builds the languages that the compiler is
written in: typically, C and maybe Ada.  If you are debugging a
miscompilation of a different stage2 front-end (for example, of the
Fortran front-end), you may want to have front-ends for other languages
in the first stage as well.  To do so, set 'STAGE1_LANGUAGES' on the
command line when doing 'make'.

 For example, in the aforementioned scenario of debugging a Fortran
front-end miscompilation caused by the stage1 compiler, you may need a
command like

     make stage2-bubble STAGE1_LANGUAGES=c,fortran

 Alternatively, you can use per-language targets to build and test
languages that are not enabled by default in stage1.  For example, 'make
f951' will build a Fortran compiler even in the stage1 build directory.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Except if the compiler was buggy and miscompiled some of the
files that were not modified.  In this case, it's best to use 'make
restrap'.

   (2) Customarily, the system compiler is also termed the 'stage0' GCC.

6.3.5 Library Source Files and Headers under the 'gcc' Directory
----------------------------------------------------------------

FIXME: list here, with explanation, all the C source files and headers
under the 'gcc' directory that aren't built into the GCC executable but
rather are part of runtime libraries and object files, such as
'crtstuff.c' and 'unwind-dw2.c'.  *Note Headers Installed by GCC:
Headers, for more information about the 'ginclude' directory.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Headers,  Next: Documentation,  Prev: Library Files,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.6 Headers Installed by GCC
------------------------------

In general, GCC expects the system C library to provide most of the
headers to be used with it.  However, GCC will fix those headers if
necessary to make them work with GCC, and will install some headers
required of freestanding implementations.  These headers are installed
in 'LIBSUBDIR/include'.  Headers for non-C runtime libraries are also
installed by GCC; these are not documented here.  (FIXME: document them
somewhere.)

 Several of the headers GCC installs are in the 'ginclude' directory.
These headers, 'iso646.h', 'stdarg.h', 'stdbool.h', and 'stddef.h', are
installed in 'LIBSUBDIR/include', unless the target Makefile fragment
(*note Target Fragment::) overrides this by setting 'USER_H'.

 In addition to these headers and those generated by fixing system
headers to work with GCC, some other headers may also be installed in
'LIBSUBDIR/include'.  'config.gcc' may set 'extra_headers'; this
specifies additional headers under 'config' to be installed on some
systems.

 GCC installs its own version of '<float.h>', from 'ginclude/float.h'.
This is done to cope with command-line options that change the
representation of floating point numbers.

 GCC also installs its own version of '<limits.h>'; this is generated
from 'glimits.h', together with 'limitx.h' and 'limity.h' if the system
also has its own version of '<limits.h>'.  (GCC provides its own header
because it is required of ISO C freestanding implementations, but needs
to include the system header from its own header as well because other
standards such as POSIX specify additional values to be defined in
'<limits.h>'.)  The system's '<limits.h>' header is used via
'LIBSUBDIR/include/syslimits.h', which is copied from 'gsyslimits.h' if
it does not need fixing to work with GCC; if it needs fixing,
'syslimits.h' is the fixed copy.

 GCC can also install '<tgmath.h>'.  It will do this when 'config.gcc'
sets 'use_gcc_tgmath' to 'yes'.

6.3.7 Building Documentation
----------------------------

The main GCC documentation is in the form of manuals in Texinfo format.
These are installed in Info format; DVI versions may be generated by
'make dvi', PDF versions by 'make pdf', and HTML versions by 'make
html'.  In addition, some man pages are generated from the Texinfo
manuals, there are some other text files with miscellaneous
documentation, and runtime libraries have their own documentation
outside the 'gcc' directory.  FIXME: document the documentation for
runtime libraries somewhere.

* Menu:

* Texinfo Manuals::      GCC manuals in Texinfo format.
* Man Page Generation::  Generating man pages from Texinfo manuals.
* Miscellaneous Docs::   Miscellaneous text files with documentation.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Texinfo Manuals,  Next: Man Page Generation,  Up: Documentation

6.3.7.1 Texinfo Manuals
.......................

The manuals for GCC as a whole, and the C and C++ front ends, are in
files 'doc/*.texi'.  Other front ends have their own manuals in files
'LANGUAGE/*.texi'.  Common files 'doc/include/*.texi' are provided which
may be included in multiple manuals; the following files are in
'doc/include':

'fdl.texi'
     The GNU Free Documentation License.
'funding.texi'
     The section "Funding Free Software".
'gcc-common.texi'
     Common definitions for manuals.
'gpl_v3.texi'
     The GNU General Public License.
'texinfo.tex'
     A copy of 'texinfo.tex' known to work with the GCC manuals.

 DVI-formatted manuals are generated by 'make dvi', which uses
'texi2dvi' (via the Makefile macro '$(TEXI2DVI)').  PDF-formatted
manuals are generated by 'make pdf', which uses 'texi2pdf' (via the
Makefile macro '$(TEXI2PDF)').  HTML formatted manuals are generated by
'make html'.  Info manuals are generated by 'make info' (which is run as
part of a bootstrap); this generates the manuals in the source
directory, using 'makeinfo' via the Makefile macro '$(MAKEINFO)', and
they are included in release distributions.

 Manuals are also provided on the GCC web site, in both HTML and
PostScript forms.  This is done via the script
'maintainer-scripts/update_web_docs_svn'.  Each manual to be provided
online must be listed in the definition of 'MANUALS' in that file; a
file 'NAME.texi' must only appear once in the source tree, and the
output manual must have the same name as the source file.  (However,
other Texinfo files, included in manuals but not themselves the root
files of manuals, may have names that appear more than once in the
source tree.)  The manual file 'NAME.texi' should only include other
files in its own directory or in 'doc/include'.  HTML manuals will be
generated by 'makeinfo --html', PostScript manuals by 'texi2dvi' and
'dvips', and PDF manuals by 'texi2pdf'.  All Texinfo files that are
parts of manuals must be version-controlled, even if they are generated
files, for the generation of online manuals to work.

 The installation manual, 'doc/install.texi', is also provided on the
GCC web site.  The HTML version is generated by the script
'doc/install.texi2html'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Man Page Generation,  Next: Miscellaneous Docs,  Prev: Texinfo Manuals,  Up: Documentation

6.3.7.2 Man Page Generation
...........................

Because of user demand, in addition to full Texinfo manuals, man pages
are provided which contain extracts from those manuals.  These man pages
are generated from the Texinfo manuals using 'contrib/texi2pod.pl' and
'pod2man'.  (The man page for 'g++', 'cp/g++.1', just contains a '.so'
reference to 'gcc.1', but all the other man pages are generated from
Texinfo manuals.)

 Because many systems may not have the necessary tools installed to
generate the man pages, they are only generated if the 'configure'
script detects that recent enough tools are installed, and the Makefiles
allow generating man pages to fail without aborting the build.  Man
pages are also included in release distributions.  They are generated in
the source directory.

 Magic comments in Texinfo files starting '@c man' control what parts of
a Texinfo file go into a man page.  Only a subset of Texinfo is
supported by 'texi2pod.pl', and it may be necessary to add support for
more Texinfo features to this script when generating new man pages.  To
improve the man page output, some special Texinfo macros are provided in
'doc/include/gcc-common.texi' which 'texi2pod.pl' understands:

'@gcctabopt'
     Use in the form '@table @gcctabopt' for tables of options, where
     for printed output the effect of '@code' is better than that of
     '@option' but for man page output a different effect is wanted.
'@gccoptlist'
     Use for summary lists of options in manuals.
'@gol'
     Use at the end of each line inside '@gccoptlist'.  This is
     necessary to avoid problems with differences in how the
     '@gccoptlist' macro is handled by different Texinfo formatters.

 FIXME: describe the 'texi2pod.pl' input language and magic comments in
more detail.

6.3.7.3 Miscellaneous Documentation
...................................

In addition to the formal documentation that is installed by GCC, there
are several other text files in the 'gcc' subdirectory with
miscellaneous documentation:

'ABOUT-GCC-NLS'
     Notes on GCC's Native Language Support.  FIXME: this should be part
     of this manual rather than a separate file.
'ABOUT-NLS'
     Notes on the Free Translation Project.
'COPYING'
'COPYING3'
     The GNU General Public License, Versions 2 and 3.
'COPYING.LIB'
'COPYING3.LIB'
     The GNU Lesser General Public License, Versions 2.1 and 3.
'*ChangeLog*'
'*/ChangeLog*'
     Change log files for various parts of GCC.
'LANGUAGES'
     Details of a few changes to the GCC front-end interface.  FIXME:
     the information in this file should be part of general
     documentation of the front-end interface in this manual.
'ONEWS'
     Information about new features in old versions of GCC.  (For recent
     versions, the information is on the GCC web site.)
'README.Portability'
     Information about portability issues when writing code in GCC.
     FIXME: why isn't this part of this manual or of the GCC Coding
     Conventions?

 FIXME: document such files in subdirectories, at least 'config', 'c',
'cp', 'objc', 'testsuite'.

6.3.8 Anatomy of a Language Front End
-------------------------------------

A front end for a language in GCC has the following parts:

   * A directory 'LANGUAGE' under 'gcc' containing source files for that
     front end.  *Note The Front End 'LANGUAGE' Directory: Front End
     Directory, for details.
   * A mention of the language in the list of supported languages in
     'gcc/doc/install.texi'.
   * A mention of the name under which the language's runtime library is
     recognized by '--enable-shared=PACKAGE' in the documentation of
     that option in 'gcc/doc/install.texi'.
   * A mention of any special prerequisites for building the front end
     in the documentation of prerequisites in 'gcc/doc/install.texi'.
   * Details of contributors to that front end in
     'gcc/doc/contrib.texi'.  If the details are in that front end's own
     manual then there should be a link to that manual's list in
     'contrib.texi'.
   * Information about support for that language in
     'gcc/doc/frontends.texi'.
   * Information about standards for that language, and the front end's
     support for them, in 'gcc/doc/standards.texi'.  This may be a link
     to such information in the front end's own manual.
   * Details of source file suffixes for that language and '-x LANG'
     options supported, in 'gcc/doc/invoke.texi'.
   * Entries in 'default_compilers' in 'gcc.c' for source file suffixes
     for that language.
   * Preferably testsuites, which may be under 'gcc/testsuite' or
     runtime library directories.  FIXME: document somewhere how to
     write testsuite harnesses.
   * Probably a runtime library for the language, outside the 'gcc'
     directory.  FIXME: document this further.
   * Details of the directories of any runtime libraries in
     'gcc/doc/sourcebuild.texi'.
   * Check targets in 'Makefile.def' for the top-level 'Makefile' to
     check just the compiler or the compiler and runtime library for the
     language.

 If the front end is added to the official GCC source repository, the
following are also necessary:

   * At least one Bugzilla component for bugs in that front end and
     runtime libraries.  This category needs to be added to the Bugzilla
     database.
   * Normally, one or more maintainers of that front end listed in
     'MAINTAINERS'.
   * Mentions on the GCC web site in 'index.html' and 'frontends.html',
     with any relevant links on 'readings.html'.  (Front ends that are
     not an official part of GCC may also be listed on 'frontends.html',
     with relevant links.)
   * A news item on 'index.html', and possibly an announcement on the
     <gcc-announce@gcc.gnu.org> mailing list.
   * The front end's manuals should be mentioned in
     'maintainer-scripts/update_web_docs_svn' (*note Texinfo Manuals::)
     and the online manuals should be linked to from
     'onlinedocs/index.html'.
   * Any old releases or CVS repositories of the front end, before its
     inclusion in GCC, should be made available on the GCC FTP site
     <ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/>.
   * The release and snapshot script 'maintainer-scripts/gcc_release'
     should be updated to generate appropriate tarballs for this front
     end.
   * If this front end includes its own version files that include the
     current date, 'maintainer-scripts/update_version' should be updated
     accordingly.

* Menu:

* Front End Directory::  The front end 'LANGUAGE' directory.
* Front End Config::     The front end 'config-lang.in' file.
* Front End Makefile::   The front end 'Make-lang.in' file.

6.3.8.1 The Front End 'LANGUAGE' Directory
..........................................

A front end 'LANGUAGE' directory contains the source files of that front
end (but not of any runtime libraries, which should be outside the 'gcc'
directory).  This includes documentation, and possibly some subsidiary
programs built alongside the front end.  Certain files are special and
other parts of the compiler depend on their names:

'config-lang.in'
     This file is required in all language subdirectories.  *Note The
     Front End 'config-lang.in' File: Front End Config, for details of
     its contents
'Make-lang.in'
     This file is required in all language subdirectories.  *Note The
     Front End 'Make-lang.in' File: Front End Makefile, for details of
     its contents.
'lang.opt'
     This file registers the set of switches that the front end accepts
     on the command line, and their '--help' text.  *Note Options::.
'lang-specs.h'
     This file provides entries for 'default_compilers' in 'gcc.c' which
     override the default of giving an error that a compiler for that
     language is not installed.
'LANGUAGE-tree.def'
     This file, which need not exist, defines any language-specific tree
     codes.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Front End Config,  Next: Front End Makefile,  Prev: Front End Directory,  Up: Front End

6.3.8.2 The Front End 'config-lang.in' File
...........................................

Each language subdirectory contains a 'config-lang.in' file.  This file
is a shell script that may define some variables describing the
language:

'language'
     This definition must be present, and gives the name of the language
     for some purposes such as arguments to '--enable-languages'.
'lang_requires'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) language front
     ends other than C that this front end requires to be enabled (with
     the names given being their 'language' settings).  For example, the
     Java front end depends on the C++ front end, so sets
     'lang_requires=c++'.
'subdir_requires'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) front end
     directories other than C that this front end requires to be
     present.  For example, the Objective-C++ front end uses source
     files from the C++ and Objective-C front ends, so sets
     'subdir_requires="cp objc"'.
'target_libs'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) targets in the
     top level 'Makefile' to build the runtime libraries for this
     language, such as 'target-libobjc'.
'lang_dirs'
     If defined, this variable lists (space-separated) top level
     directories (parallel to 'gcc'), apart from the runtime libraries,
     that should not be configured if this front end is not built.
'build_by_default'
     If defined to 'no', this language front end is not built unless
     enabled in a '--enable-languages' argument.  Otherwise, front ends
     are built by default, subject to any special logic in
     'configure.ac' (as is present to disable the Ada front end if the
     Ada compiler is not already installed).
'boot_language'
     If defined to 'yes', this front end is built in stage1 of the
     bootstrap.  This is only relevant to front ends written in their
     own languages.
'compilers'
     If defined, a space-separated list of compiler executables that
     will be run by the driver.  The names here will each end with
     '\$(exeext)'.
'outputs'
     If defined, a space-separated list of files that should be
     generated by 'configure' substituting values in them.  This
     mechanism can be used to create a file 'LANGUAGE/Makefile' from
     'LANGUAGE/Makefile.in', but this is deprecated, building everything
     from the single 'gcc/Makefile' is preferred.
'gtfiles'
     If defined, a space-separated list of files that should be scanned

     routines for this language.  This excludes the files that are
     common to all front ends.  *Note Type Information::.

6.3.8.3 The Front End 'Make-lang.in' File
.........................................

Each language subdirectory contains a 'Make-lang.in' file.  It contains
targets 'LANG.HOOK' (where 'LANG' is the setting of 'language' in
'config-lang.in') for the following values of 'HOOK', and any other
Makefile rules required to build those targets (which may if necessary
use other Makefiles specified in 'outputs' in 'config-lang.in', although
this is deprecated).  It also adds any testsuite targets that can use
the standard rule in 'gcc/Makefile.in' to the variable 'lang_checks'.

'all.cross'
'start.encap'
'rest.encap'
     FIXME: exactly what goes in each of these targets?
'tags'
     Build an 'etags' 'TAGS' file in the language subdirectory in the
     source tree.
'info'
     Build info documentation for the front end, in the build directory.
     This target is only called by 'make bootstrap' if a suitable
     version of 'makeinfo' is available, so does not need to check for
     this, and should fail if an error occurs.
'dvi'
     Build DVI documentation for the front end, in the build directory.
     This should be done using '$(TEXI2DVI)', with appropriate '-I'
     arguments pointing to directories of included files.
'pdf'
     Build PDF documentation for the front end, in the build directory.
     This should be done using '$(TEXI2PDF)', with appropriate '-I'
     arguments pointing to directories of included files.
'html'
     Build HTML documentation for the front end, in the build directory.
'man'
     Build generated man pages for the front end from Texinfo manuals
     (*note Man Page Generation::), in the build directory.  This target
     is only called if the necessary tools are available, but should
     ignore errors so as not to stop the build if errors occur; man
     pages are optional and the tools involved may be installed in a
     broken way.
'install-common'
     Install everything that is part of the front end, apart from the
     compiler executables listed in 'compilers' in 'config-lang.in'.
'install-info'
     Install info documentation for the front end, if it is present in
     the source directory.  This target should have dependencies on info
     files that should be installed.
'install-man'
     Install man pages for the front end.  This target should ignore
     errors.
'install-plugin'
     Install headers needed for plugins.
'srcextra'
     Copies its dependencies into the source directory.  This generally
     should be used for generated files such as Bison output files which
     are not version-controlled, but should be included in any release
     tarballs.  This target will be executed during a bootstrap if
     '--enable-generated-files-in-srcdir' was specified as a 'configure'
     option.
'srcinfo'
'srcman'
     Copies its dependencies into the source directory.  These targets
     will be executed during a bootstrap if
     '--enable-generated-files-in-srcdir' was specified as a 'configure'
     option.
'uninstall'
     Uninstall files installed by installing the compiler.  This is
     currently documented not to be supported, so the hook need not do
     anything.
'mostlyclean'
'clean'
'distclean'
'maintainer-clean'
     The language parts of the standard GNU '*clean' targets.  *Note
     Standard Targets for Users: (standards)Standard Targets, for
     details of the standard targets.  For GCC, 'maintainer-clean'
     should delete all generated files in the source directory that are
     not version-controlled, but should not delete anything that is.

 'Make-lang.in' must also define a variable 'LANG_OBJS' to a list of
host object files that are used by that language.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Back End,  Prev: Front End,  Up: gcc Directory

6.3.9 Anatomy of a Target Back End
----------------------------------

A back end for a target architecture in GCC has the following parts:

   * A directory 'MACHINE' under 'gcc/config', containing a machine
     description 'MACHINE.md' file (*note Machine Descriptions: Machine
     Desc.), header files 'MACHINE.h' and 'MACHINE-protos.h' and a
     source file 'MACHINE.c' (*note Target Description Macros and
     Functions: Target Macros.), possibly a target Makefile fragment
     't-MACHINE' (*note The Target Makefile Fragment: Target Fragment.),
     and maybe some other files.  The names of these files may be
     changed from the defaults given by explicit specifications in
     'config.gcc'.
   * If necessary, a file 'MACHINE-modes.def' in the 'MACHINE'
     directory, containing additional machine modes to represent
     condition codes.  *Note Condition Code::, for further details.
   * An optional 'MACHINE.opt' file in the 'MACHINE' directory,
     containing a list of target-specific options.  You can also add
     other option files using the 'extra_options' variable in
     'config.gcc'.  *Note Options::.
   * Entries in 'config.gcc' (*note The 'config.gcc' File: System
     Config.) for the systems with this target architecture.
   * Documentation in 'gcc/doc/invoke.texi' for any command-line options
     supported by this target (*note Run-time Target Specification:
     Run-time Target.).  This means both entries in the summary table of
     options and details of the individual options.
   * Documentation in 'gcc/doc/extend.texi' for any target-specific
     attributes supported (*note Defining target-specific uses of
     '__attribute__': Target Attributes.), including where the same
     attribute is already supported on some targets, which are
     enumerated in the manual.
   * Documentation in 'gcc/doc/extend.texi' for any target-specific
     pragmas supported.
   * Documentation in 'gcc/doc/extend.texi' of any target-specific
     built-in functions supported.
   * Documentation in 'gcc/doc/extend.texi' of any target-specific
     format checking styles supported.
   * Documentation in 'gcc/doc/md.texi' of any target-specific
     constraint letters (*note Constraints for Particular Machines:
     Machine Constraints.).
   * A note in 'gcc/doc/contrib.texi' under the person or people who
     contributed the target support.
   * Entries in 'gcc/doc/install.texi' for all target triplets supported
     with this target architecture, giving details of any special notes
     about installation for this target, or saying that there are no
     special notes if there are none.
   * Possibly other support outside the 'gcc' directory for runtime
     libraries.  FIXME: reference docs for this.  The 'libstdc++'
     porting manual needs to be installed as info for this to work, or
     to be a chapter of this manual.

 If the back end is added to the official GCC source repository, the
following are also necessary:

   * An entry for the target architecture in 'readings.html' on the GCC
     web site, with any relevant links.
   * Details of the properties of the back end and target architecture
     in 'backends.html' on the GCC web site.
   * A news item about the contribution of support for that target
     architecture, in 'index.html' on the GCC web site.
   * Normally, one or more maintainers of that target listed in
     'MAINTAINERS'.  Some existing architectures may be unmaintained,
     but it would be unusual to add support for a target that does not
     have a maintainer when support is added.
   * Target triplets covering all 'config.gcc' stanzas for the target,
     in the list in 'contrib/config-list.mk'.

7 Testsuites
************

GCC contains several testsuites to help maintain compiler quality.  Most
of the runtime libraries and language front ends in GCC have testsuites.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Test Idioms,  Next: Test Directives,  Up: Testsuites

7.1 Idioms Used in Testsuite Code
=================================

In general, C testcases have a trailing '-N.c', starting with '-1.c', in
case other testcases with similar names are added later.  If the test is
a test of some well-defined feature, it should have a name referring to
that feature such as 'FEATURE-1.c'.  If it does not test a well-defined
feature but just happens to exercise a bug somewhere in the compiler,
and a bug report has been filed for this bug in the GCC bug database,
'prBUG-NUMBER-1.c' is the appropriate form of name.  Otherwise (for
miscellaneous bugs not filed in the GCC bug database), and previously
more generally, test cases are named after the date on which they were
added.  This allows people to tell at a glance whether a test failure is
because of a recently found bug that has not yet been fixed, or whether
it may be a regression, but does not give any other information about
the bug or where discussion of it may be found.  Some other language
testsuites follow similar conventions.

 In the 'gcc.dg' testsuite, it is often necessary to test that an error
is indeed a hard error and not just a warning--for example, where it is
a constraint violation in the C standard, which must become an error
with '-pedantic-errors'.  The following idiom, where the first line
shown is line LINE of the file and the line that generates the error, is
used for this:

     /* { dg-bogus "warning" "warning in place of error" } */
     /* { dg-error "REGEXP" "MESSAGE" { target *-*-* } LINE } */

 It may be necessary to check that an expression is an integer constant
expression and has a certain value.  To check that 'E' has value 'V', an
idiom similar to the following is used:

     char x[((E) == (V) ? 1 : -1)];

 In 'gcc.dg' tests, '__typeof__' is sometimes used to make assertions
about the types of expressions.  See, for example,
'gcc.dg/c99-condexpr-1.c'.  The more subtle uses depend on the exact
rules for the types of conditional expressions in the C standard; see,
for example, 'gcc.dg/c99-intconst-1.c'.

 It is useful to be able to test that optimizations are being made
properly.  This cannot be done in all cases, but it can be done where
the optimization will lead to code being optimized away (for example,
where flow analysis or alias analysis should show that certain code
cannot be called) or to functions not being called because they have
been expanded as built-in functions.  Such tests go in
'gcc.c-torture/execute'.  Where code should be optimized away, a call to
a nonexistent function such as 'link_failure ()' may be inserted; a
definition

     #ifndef __OPTIMIZE__
     void
     link_failure (void)
     {
       abort ();
     }
     #endif

will also be needed so that linking still succeeds when the test is run
without optimization.  When all calls to a built-in function should have
been optimized and no calls to the non-built-in version of the function
should remain, that function may be defined as 'static' to call 'abort
()' (although redeclaring a function as static may not work on all
targets).

 All testcases must be portable.  Target-specific testcases must have
appropriate code to avoid causing failures on unsupported systems;
unfortunately, the mechanisms for this differ by directory.

 FIXME: discuss non-C testsuites here.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Directives,  Next: Selectors,  Up: Test Directives

7.2.1 Syntax and Descriptions of test directives
------------------------------------------------

Test directives appear within comments in a test source file and begin
with 'dg-'.  Some of these are defined within DejaGnu and others are
local to the GCC testsuite.

 The order in which test directives appear in a test can be important:
directives local to GCC sometimes override information used by the
DejaGnu directives, which know nothing about the GCC directives, so the
DejaGnu directives must precede GCC directives.

 Several test directives include selectors (*note Selectors::) which are
usually preceded by the keyword 'target' or 'xfail'.

7.2.1.1 Specify how to build the test
.....................................

'{ dg-do DO-WHAT-KEYWORD [{ target/xfail SELECTOR }] }'
     DO-WHAT-KEYWORD specifies how the test is compiled and whether it
     is executed.  It is one of:

     'preprocess'
          Compile with '-E' to run only the preprocessor.
     'compile'
          Compile with '-S' to produce an assembly code file.
     'assemble'
          Compile with '-c' to produce a relocatable object file.
     'link'
          Compile, assemble, and link to produce an executable file.
     'run'
          Produce and run an executable file, which is expected to
          return an exit code of 0.

     The default is 'compile'.  That can be overridden for a set of
     tests by redefining 'dg-do-what-default' within the '.exp' file for
     those tests.

     If the directive includes the optional '{ target SELECTOR }' then
     the test is skipped unless the target system matches the SELECTOR.

     If DO-WHAT-KEYWORD is 'run' and the directive includes the optional
     '{ xfail SELECTOR }' and the selector is met then the test is
     expected to fail.  The 'xfail' clause is ignored for other values
     of DO-WHAT-KEYWORD; those tests can use directive 'dg-xfail-if'.

7.2.1.2 Specify additional compiler options
...........................................

'{ dg-options OPTIONS [{ target SELECTOR }] }'
     This DejaGnu directive provides a list of compiler options, to be
     used if the target system matches SELECTOR, that replace the
     default options used for this set of tests.

'{ dg-add-options FEATURE ... }'
     Add any compiler options that are needed to access certain
     features.  This directive does nothing on targets that enable the
     features by default, or that don't provide them at all.  It must
     come after all 'dg-options' directives.  For supported values of
     FEATURE see *note Add Options::.

'{ dg-additional-options OPTIONS [{ target SELECTOR }] }'
     This directive provides a list of compiler options, to be used if
     the target system matches SELECTOR, that are added to the default
     options used for this set of tests.

7.2.1.3 Modify the test timeout value
.....................................

The normal timeout limit, in seconds, is found by searching the
following in order:

   * the value defined by an earlier 'dg-timeout' directive in the test

   * variable TOOL_TIMEOUT defined by the set of tests

   * GCC,TIMEOUT set in the target board

   * 300

'{ dg-timeout N [{target SELECTOR }] }'
     Set the time limit for the compilation and for the execution of the
     test to the specified number of seconds.

'{ dg-timeout-factor X [{ target SELECTOR }] }'
     Multiply the normal time limit for compilation and execution of the
     test by the specified floating-point factor.

7.2.1.4 Skip a test for some targets
....................................

'{ dg-skip-if COMMENT { SELECTOR } [{ INCLUDE-OPTS } [{ EXCLUDE-OPTS }]] }'
     Arguments INCLUDE-OPTS and EXCLUDE-OPTS are lists in which each
     element is a string of zero or more GCC options.  Skip the test if
     all of the following conditions are met:
        * the test system is included in SELECTOR

        * for at least one of the option strings in INCLUDE-OPTS, every
          option from that string is in the set of options with which
          the test would be compiled; use '"*"' for an INCLUDE-OPTS list
          that matches any options; that is the default if INCLUDE-OPTS
          is not specified

        * for each of the option strings in EXCLUDE-OPTS, at least one
          option from that string is not in the set of options with
          which the test would be compiled; use '""' for an empty
          EXCLUDE-OPTS list; that is the default if EXCLUDE-OPTS is not
          specified

     For example, to skip a test if option '-Os' is present:

          /* { dg-skip-if "" { *-*-* }  { "-Os" } { "" } } */

     To skip a test if both options '-O2' and '-g' are present:

          /* { dg-skip-if "" { *-*-* }  { "-O2 -g" } { "" } } */

     To skip a test if either '-O2' or '-O3' is present:

          /* { dg-skip-if "" { *-*-* }  { "-O2" "-O3" } { "" } } */

     To skip a test unless option '-Os' is present:

          /* { dg-skip-if "" { *-*-* }  { "*" } { "-Os" } } */

     To skip a test if either '-O2' or '-O3' is used with '-g' but not
     if '-fpic' is also present:

          /* { dg-skip-if "" { *-*-* }  { "-O2 -g" "-O3 -g" } { "-fpic" } } */

'{ dg-require-effective-target KEYWORD [{ SELECTOR }] }'
     Skip the test if the test target, including current multilib flags,
     is not covered by the effective-target keyword.  If the directive
     includes the optional '{ SELECTOR }' then the effective-target test
     is only performed if the target system matches the SELECTOR.  This
     directive must appear after any 'dg-do' directive in the test and
     before any 'dg-additional-sources' directive.  *Note
     Effective-Target Keywords::.

'{ dg-require-SUPPORT args }'
     Skip the test if the target does not provide the required support.
     These directives must appear after any 'dg-do' directive in the
     test and before any 'dg-additional-sources' directive.  They
     require at least one argument, which can be an empty string if the
     specific procedure does not examine the argument.  *Note Require
     Support::, for a complete list of these directives.

7.2.1.5 Expect a test to fail for some targets
..............................................

'{ dg-xfail-if COMMENT { SELECTOR } [{ INCLUDE-OPTS } [{ EXCLUDE-OPTS }]] }'
     Expect the test to fail if the conditions (which are the same as
     for 'dg-skip-if') are met.  This does not affect the execute step.

'{ dg-xfail-run-if COMMENT { SELECTOR } [{ INCLUDE-OPTS } [{ EXCLUDE-OPTS }]] }'
     Expect the execute step of a test to fail if the conditions (which
     are the same as for 'dg-skip-if') are met.

7.2.1.6 Expect the test executable to fail
..........................................

'{ dg-shouldfail COMMENT [{ SELECTOR } [{ INCLUDE-OPTS } [{ EXCLUDE-OPTS }]]] }'
     Expect the test executable to return a nonzero exit status if the
     conditions (which are the same as for 'dg-skip-if') are met.

7.2.1.7 Verify compiler messages
................................

'{ dg-error REGEXP [COMMENT [{ target/xfail SELECTOR } [LINE] }]] }'
     This DejaGnu directive appears on a source line that is expected to
     get an error message, or else specifies the source line associated
     with the message.  If there is no message for that line or if the
     text of that message is not matched by REGEXP then the check fails
     and COMMENT is included in the 'FAIL' message.  The check does not
     look for the string 'error' unless it is part of REGEXP.

'{ dg-warning REGEXP [COMMENT [{ target/xfail SELECTOR } [LINE] }]] }'
     This DejaGnu directive appears on a source line that is expected to
     get a warning message, or else specifies the source line associated
     with the message.  If there is no message for that line or if the
     text of that message is not matched by REGEXP then the check fails
     and COMMENT is included in the 'FAIL' message.  The check does not
     look for the string 'warning' unless it is part of REGEXP.

'{ dg-message REGEXP [COMMENT [{ target/xfail SELECTOR } [LINE] }]] }'
     The line is expected to get a message other than an error or
     warning.  If there is no message for that line or if the text of
     that message is not matched by REGEXP then the check fails and
     COMMENT is included in the 'FAIL' message.

'{ dg-bogus REGEXP [COMMENT [{ target/xfail SELECTOR } [LINE] }]] }'
     This DejaGnu directive appears on a source line that should not get
     a message matching REGEXP, or else specifies the source line
     associated with the bogus message.  It is usually used with 'xfail'
     to indicate that the message is a known problem for a particular
     set of targets.

'{ dg-excess-errors COMMENT [{ target/xfail SELECTOR }] }'
     This DejaGnu directive indicates that the test is expected to fail
     due to compiler messages that are not handled by 'dg-error',
     'dg-warning' or 'dg-bogus'.  For this directive 'xfail' has the
     same effect as 'target'.

'{ dg-prune-output REGEXP }'
     Prune messages matching REGEXP from the test output.

7.2.1.8 Verify output of the test executable
............................................

'{ dg-output REGEXP [{ target/xfail SELECTOR }] }'
     This DejaGnu directive compares REGEXP to the combined output that
     the test executable writes to 'stdout' and 'stderr'.

7.2.1.9 Specify additional files for a test
...........................................

'{ dg-additional-files "FILELIST" }'
     Specify additional files, other than source files, that must be
     copied to the system where the compiler runs.

'{ dg-additional-sources "FILELIST" }'
     Specify additional source files to appear in the compile line
     following the main test file.

7.2.1.10 Add checks at the end of a test
........................................

'{ dg-final { LOCAL-DIRECTIVE } }'
     This DejaGnu directive is placed within a comment anywhere in the
     source file and is processed after the test has been compiled and
     run.  Multiple 'dg-final' commands are processed in the order in
     which they appear in the source file.  *Note Final Actions::, for a
     list of directives that can be used within 'dg-final'.

7.2.2 Selecting targets to which a test applies
-----------------------------------------------

Several test directives include SELECTORs to limit the targets for which
a test is run or to declare that a test is expected to fail on
particular targets.

 A selector is:
   * one or more target triplets, possibly including wildcard
     characters; use '*-*-*' to match any target
   * a single effective-target keyword (*note Effective-Target
     Keywords::)
   * a logical expression

 Depending on the context, the selector specifies whether a test is
skipped and reported as unsupported or is expected to fail.  A context
that allows either 'target' or 'xfail' also allows '{ target SELECTOR1
xfail SELECTOR2 }' to skip the test for targets that don't match
SELECTOR1 and the test to fail for targets that match SELECTOR2.

 A selector expression appears within curly braces and uses a single
logical operator: one of '!', '&&', or '||'.  An operand is another
selector expression, an effective-target keyword, a single target
triplet, or a list of target triplets within quotes or curly braces.
For example:

     { target { ! "hppa*-*-* ia64*-*-*" } }
     { target { powerpc*-*-* && lp64 } }
     { xfail { lp64 || vect_no_align } }


File: gccint.info,  Node: Effective-Target Keywords,  Next: Add Options,  Prev: Selectors,  Up: Test Directives

7.2.3 Keywords describing target attributes
-------------------------------------------

Effective-target keywords identify sets of targets that support
particular functionality.  They are used to limit tests to be run only
for particular targets, or to specify that particular sets of targets
are expected to fail some tests.

 Effective-target keywords are defined in 'lib/target-supports.exp' in
the GCC testsuite, with the exception of those that are documented as
being local to a particular test directory.

 The 'effective target' takes into account all of the compiler options
with which the test will be compiled, including the multilib options.
By convention, keywords ending in '_nocache' can also include options
specified for the particular test in an earlier 'dg-options' or
'dg-add-options' directive.

7.2.5 Variants of 'dg-require-SUPPORT'
--------------------------------------

A few of the 'dg-require' directives take arguments.

'dg-require-iconv CODESET'
     Skip the test if the target does not support iconv.  CODESET is the
     codeset to convert to.

'dg-require-profiling PROFOPT'
     Skip the test if the target does not support profiling with option
     PROFOPT.

'dg-require-visibility VIS'
     Skip the test if the target does not support the 'visibility'
     attribute.  If VIS is '""', support for 'visibility("hidden")' is
     checked, for 'visibility("VIS")' otherwise.

 The original 'dg-require' directives were defined before there was
support for effective-target keywords.  The directives that do not take
arguments could be replaced with effective-target keywords.

'dg-require-alias ""'
     Skip the test if the target does not support the 'alias' attribute.

'dg-require-ascii-locale ""'
     Skip the test if the host does not support an ASCII locale.

     Skip this test unless both compilers in a 'compat' testsuite
     support decimal floating point.

'dg-require-cxa-atexit ""'
     Skip the test if the target does not support '__cxa_atexit'.  This
     is equivalent to 'dg-require-effective-target cxa_atexit'.

     Skip the test if the target does not support DLL attributes.

'dg-require-fork ""'
     Skip the test if the target does not support 'fork'.

'dg-require-gc-sections ""'
     Skip the test if the target's linker does not support the
     '--gc-sections' flags.  This is equivalent to
     'dg-require-effective-target gc-sections'.

'dg-require-host-local ""'
     Skip the test if the host is remote, rather than the same as the
     build system.  Some tests are incompatible with DejaGnu's handling
     of remote hosts, which involves copying the source file to the host
     and compiling it with a relative path and "'-o a.out'".

'dg-require-mkfifo ""'
     Skip the test if the target does not support 'mkfifo'.

'dg-require-named-sections ""'
     Skip the test is the target does not support named sections.  This
     is equivalent to 'dg-require-effective-target named_sections'.

'dg-require-weak ""'
     Skip the test if the target does not support weak symbols.

'dg-require-weak-override ""'
     Skip the test if the target does not support overriding weak

7.3 Ada Language Testsuites
===========================

The Ada testsuite includes executable tests from the ACATS testsuite,
publicly available at <http://www.ada-auth.org/acats.html>.

 These tests are integrated in the GCC testsuite in the 'ada/acats'
directory, and enabled automatically when running 'make check', assuming
the Ada language has been enabled when configuring GCC.

 You can also run the Ada testsuite independently, using 'make
check-ada', or run a subset of the tests by specifying which chapter to
run, e.g.:

     $ make check-ada CHAPTERS="c3 c9"

 The tests are organized by directory, each directory corresponding to a
chapter of the Ada Reference Manual.  So for example, 'c9' corresponds
to chapter 9, which deals with tasking features of the language.

 There is also an extra chapter called 'gcc' containing a template for
creating new executable tests, although this is deprecated in favor of
the 'gnat.dg' testsuite.

 The tests are run using two 'sh' scripts: 'run_acats' and 'run_all.sh'.
To run the tests using a simulator or a cross target, see the small
customization section at the top of 'run_all.sh'.

 These tests are run using the build tree: they can be run without doing
a 'make install'.

7.4 C Language Testsuites
=========================

GCC contains the following C language testsuites, in the 'gcc/testsuite'
directory:

'gcc.dg'
     This contains tests of particular features of the C compiler, using
     the more modern 'dg' harness.  Correctness tests for various
     compiler features should go here if possible.

     Magic comments determine whether the file is preprocessed,
     compiled, linked or run.  In these tests, error and warning message
     texts are compared against expected texts or regular expressions
     given in comments.  These tests are run with the options '-ansi
     -pedantic' unless other options are given in the test.  Except as
     noted below they are not run with multiple optimization options.
'gcc.dg/compat'
     This subdirectory contains tests for binary compatibility using
     'lib/compat.exp', which in turn uses the language-independent
     support (*note Support for testing binary compatibility: compat
     Testing.).
'gcc.dg/cpp'
     This subdirectory contains tests of the preprocessor.
'gcc.dg/debug'
     This subdirectory contains tests for debug formats.  Tests in this
     subdirectory are run for each debug format that the compiler
     supports.
'gcc.dg/format'
     This subdirectory contains tests of the '-Wformat' format checking.
     Tests in this directory are run with and without '-DWIDE'.
'gcc.dg/noncompile'
     This subdirectory contains tests of code that should not compile
     and does not need any special compilation options.  They are run
     with multiple optimization options, since sometimes invalid code
     crashes the compiler with optimization.
'gcc.dg/special'
     FIXME: describe this.

'gcc.c-torture'
     This contains particular code fragments which have historically
     broken easily.  These tests are run with multiple optimization
     options, so tests for features which only break at some
     optimization levels belong here.  This also contains tests to check
     that certain optimizations occur.  It might be worthwhile to
     separate the correctness tests cleanly from the code quality tests,
     but it hasn't been done yet.

'gcc.c-torture/compat'
     FIXME: describe this.

     This directory should probably not be used for new tests.
'gcc.c-torture/compile'
     This testsuite contains test cases that should compile, but do not
     need to link or run.  These test cases are compiled with several
     different combinations of optimization options.  All warnings are
     disabled for these test cases, so this directory is not suitable if
     you wish to test for the presence or absence of compiler warnings.
     While special options can be set, and tests disabled on specific
     platforms, by the use of '.x' files, mostly these test cases should
     not contain platform dependencies.  FIXME: discuss how defines such
     as 'NO_LABEL_VALUES' and 'STACK_SIZE' are used.
'gcc.c-torture/execute'
     This testsuite contains test cases that should compile, link and
     run; otherwise the same comments as for 'gcc.c-torture/compile'
     apply.
'gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee'
     This contains tests which are specific to IEEE floating point.
'gcc.c-torture/unsorted'
     FIXME: describe this.

     This directory should probably not be used for new tests.
'gcc.misc-tests'
     This directory contains C tests that require special handling.
     Some of these tests have individual expect files, and others share
     special-purpose expect files:

     'bprob*.c'
          Test '-fbranch-probabilities' using
          'gcc.misc-tests/bprob.exp', which in turn uses the generic,
          language-independent framework (*note Support for testing
          profile-directed optimizations: profopt Testing.).

     'gcov*.c'
          Test 'gcov' output using 'gcov.exp', which in turn uses the
          language-independent support (*note Support for testing gcov:
          gcov Testing.).

     'i386-pf-*.c'
          Test i386-specific support for data prefetch using
          'i386-prefetch.exp'.

'gcc.test-framework'
     'dg-*.c'
          Test the testsuite itself using
          'gcc.test-framework/test-framework.exp'.

 FIXME: merge in 'testsuite/README.gcc' and discuss the format of test
cases and magic comments more.

7.5 The Java library testsuites.
================================

Runtime tests are executed via 'make check' in the
'TARGET/libjava/testsuite' directory in the build tree.  Additional
runtime tests can be checked into this testsuite.

 Regression testing of the core packages in libgcj is also covered by
the Mauve testsuite.  The Mauve Project develops tests for the Java
Class Libraries.  These tests are run as part of libgcj testing by
placing the Mauve tree within the libjava testsuite sources at
'libjava/testsuite/libjava.mauve/mauve', or by specifying the location
of that tree when invoking 'make', as in 'make MAUVEDIR=~/mauve check'.

 To detect regressions, a mechanism in 'mauve.exp' compares the failures
for a test run against the list of expected failures in
'libjava/testsuite/libjava.mauve/xfails' from the source hierarchy.
Update this file when adding new failing tests to Mauve, or when fixing
bugs in libgcj that had caused Mauve test failures.

 We encourage developers to contribute test cases to Mauve.

7.6 Support for testing link-time optimizations
===============================================

Tests for link-time optimizations usually require multiple source files
that are compiled separately, perhaps with different sets of options.
There are several special-purpose test directives used for these tests.

'{ dg-lto-do DO-WHAT-KEYWORD }'
     DO-WHAT-KEYWORD specifies how the test is compiled and whether it
     is executed.  It is one of:

     'assemble'
          Compile with '-c' to produce a relocatable object file.
     'link'
          Compile, assemble, and link to produce an executable file.
     'run'
          Produce and run an executable file, which is expected to
          return an exit code of 0.

     The default is 'assemble'.  That can be overridden for a set of
     tests by redefining 'dg-do-what-default' within the '.exp' file for
     those tests.

     Unlike 'dg-do', 'dg-lto-do' does not support an optional 'target'
     or 'xfail' list.  Use 'dg-skip-if', 'dg-xfail-if', or
     'dg-xfail-run-if'.

'{ dg-lto-options { { OPTIONS } [{ OPTIONS }] } [{ target SELECTOR }]}'
     This directive provides a list of one or more sets of compiler
     options to override LTO_OPTIONS.  Each test will be compiled and
     run with each of these sets of options.

'{ dg-extra-ld-options OPTIONS [{ target SELECTOR }]}'
     This directive adds OPTIONS to the linker options used.

'{ dg-suppress-ld-options OPTIONS [{ target SELECTOR }]}'
     This directive removes OPTIONS from the set of linker options used.


File: gccint.info,  Node: gcov Testing,  Next: profopt Testing,  Prev: LTO Testing,  Up: Testsuites

7.7 Support for testing 'gcov'
==============================

Language-independent support for testing 'gcov', and for checking that
branch profiling produces expected values, is provided by the expect
file 'lib/gcov.exp'.  'gcov' tests also rely on procedures in
'lib/gcc-dg.exp' to compile and run the test program.  A typical 'gcov'
test contains the following DejaGnu commands within comments:

     { dg-options "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" }
     { dg-do run { target native } }
     { dg-final { run-gcov sourcefile } }

 Checks of 'gcov' output can include line counts, branch percentages,
and call return percentages.  All of these checks are requested via
commands that appear in comments in the test's source file.  Commands to
check line counts are processed by default.  Commands to check branch
percentages and call return percentages are processed if the 'run-gcov'
command has arguments 'branches' or 'calls', respectively.  For example,
the following specifies checking both, as well as passing '-b' to
'gcov':

     { dg-final { run-gcov branches calls { -b sourcefile } } }

 A line count command appears within a comment on the source line that
is expected to get the specified count and has the form 'count(CNT)'.  A
test should only check line counts for lines that will get the same
count for any architecture.

 Commands to check branch percentages ('branch') and call return
percentages ('returns') are very similar to each other.  A beginning
command appears on or before the first of a range of lines that will
report the percentage, and the ending command follows that range of
lines.  The beginning command can include a list of percentages, all of
which are expected to be found within the range.  A range is terminated
by the next command of the same kind.  A command 'branch(end)' or
'returns(end)' marks the end of a range without starting a new one.  For
example:

     if (i > 10 && j > i && j < 20)  /* branch(27 50 75) */
                                     /* branch(end) */
       foo (i, j);

 For a call return percentage, the value specified is the percentage of
calls reported to return.  For a branch percentage, the value is either
the expected percentage or 100 minus that value, since the direction of
a branch can differ depending on the target or the optimization level.

 Not all branches and calls need to be checked.  A test should not check
for branches that might be optimized away or replaced with predicated
instructions.  Don't check for calls inserted by the compiler or ones
that might be inlined or optimized away.

 A single test can check for combinations of line counts, branch
percentages, and call return percentages.  The command to check a line
count must appear on the line that will report that count, but commands
to check branch percentages and call return percentages can bracket the
lines that report them.

7.8 Support for testing profile-directed optimizations
======================================================

The file 'profopt.exp' provides language-independent support for
checking correct execution of a test built with profile-directed
optimization.  This testing requires that a test program be built and
executed twice.  The first time it is compiled to generate profile data,
and the second time it is compiled to use the data that was generated
during the first execution.  The second execution is to verify that the
test produces the expected results.

 To check that the optimization actually generated better code, a test
can be built and run a third time with normal optimizations to verify
that the performance is better with the profile-directed optimizations.
'profopt.exp' has the beginnings of this kind of support.

 'profopt.exp' provides generic support for profile-directed
optimizations.  Each set of tests that uses it provides information
about a specific optimization:

'tool'
     tool being tested, e.g., 'gcc'

'profile_option'
     options used to generate profile data

'feedback_option'
     options used to optimize using that profile data

'prof_ext'
     suffix of profile data files

'PROFOPT_OPTIONS'
     list of options with which to run each test, similar to the lists
     for torture tests

'{ dg-final-generate { LOCAL-DIRECTIVE } }'
     This directive is similar to 'dg-final', but the LOCAL-DIRECTIVE is
     run after the generation of profile data.

'{ dg-final-use { LOCAL-DIRECTIVE } }'
     The LOCAL-DIRECTIVE is run after the profile data have been used.


File: gccint.info,  Node: compat Testing,  Next: Torture Tests,  Prev: profopt Testing,  Up: Testsuites

7.9 Support for testing binary compatibility
============================================

The file 'compat.exp' provides language-independent support for binary
compatibility testing.  It supports testing interoperability of two
compilers that follow the same ABI, or of multiple sets of compiler
options that should not affect binary compatibility.  It is intended to
be used for testsuites that complement ABI testsuites.

 A test supported by this framework has three parts, each in a separate
source file: a main program and two pieces that interact with each other
to split up the functionality being tested.

'TESTNAME_main.SUFFIX'
     Contains the main program, which calls a function in file
     'TESTNAME_x.SUFFIX'.

'TESTNAME_x.SUFFIX'
     Contains at least one call to a function in 'TESTNAME_y.SUFFIX'.

'TESTNAME_y.SUFFIX'
     Shares data with, or gets arguments from, 'TESTNAME_x.SUFFIX'.

 Within each test, the main program and one functional piece are
compiled by the GCC under test.  The other piece can be compiled by an
alternate compiler.  If no alternate compiler is specified, then all
three source files are all compiled by the GCC under test.  You can
specify pairs of sets of compiler options.  The first element of such a
pair specifies options used with the GCC under test, and the second
element of the pair specifies options used with the alternate compiler.
Each test is compiled with each pair of options.

 'compat.exp' defines default pairs of compiler options.  These can be
overridden by defining the environment variable 'COMPAT_OPTIONS' as:

     COMPAT_OPTIONS="[list [list {TST1} {ALT1}]
       ...[list {TSTN} {ALTN}]]"

 where TSTI and ALTI are lists of options, with TSTI used by the
compiler under test and ALTI used by the alternate compiler.  For
example, with '[list [list {-g -O0} {-O3}] [list {-fpic} {-fPIC -O2}]]',
the test is first built with '-g -O0' by the compiler under test and
with '-O3' by the alternate compiler.  The test is built a second time
using '-fpic' by the compiler under test and '-fPIC -O2' by the
alternate compiler.

 An alternate compiler is specified by defining an environment variable
to be the full pathname of an installed compiler; for C define
'ALT_CC_UNDER_TEST', and for C++ define 'ALT_CXX_UNDER_TEST'.  These
will be written to the 'site.exp' file used by DejaGnu.  The default is
to build each test with the compiler under test using the first of each
pair of compiler options from 'COMPAT_OPTIONS'.  When
'ALT_CC_UNDER_TEST' or 'ALT_CXX_UNDER_TEST' is 'same', each test is
built using the compiler under test but with combinations of the options
from 'COMPAT_OPTIONS'.

 To run only the C++ compatibility suite using the compiler under test
and another version of GCC using specific compiler options, do the
following from 'OBJDIR/gcc':

     rm site.exp
     make -k \
       ALT_CXX_UNDER_TEST=${alt_prefix}/bin/g++ \
       COMPAT_OPTIONS="LISTS AS SHOWN ABOVE" \
       check-c++ \
       RUNTESTFLAGS="compat.exp"

 A test that fails when the source files are compiled with different
compilers, but passes when the files are compiled with the same
compiler, demonstrates incompatibility of the generated code or runtime
support.  A test that fails for the alternate compiler but passes for
the compiler under test probably tests for a bug that was fixed in the
compiler under test but is present in the alternate compiler.

 The binary compatibility tests support a small number of test framework
commands that appear within comments in a test file.

'dg-require-*'
     These commands can be used in 'TESTNAME_main.SUFFIX' to skip the
     test if specific support is not available on the target.

'dg-options'
     The specified options are used for compiling this particular source
     file, appended to the options from 'COMPAT_OPTIONS'.  When this
     command appears in 'TESTNAME_main.SUFFIX' the options are also used
     to link the test program.

'dg-xfail-if'
     This command can be used in a secondary source file to specify that
     compilation is expected to fail for particular options on
     particular targets.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Torture Tests,  Prev: compat Testing,  Up: Testsuites

7.10 Support for torture testing using multiple options
=======================================================

Throughout the compiler testsuite there are several directories whose
tests are run multiple times, each with a different set of options.
These are known as torture tests.  'lib/torture-options.exp' defines
procedures to set up these lists:

'torture-init'
     Initialize use of torture lists.
'set-torture-options'
     Set lists of torture options to use for tests with and without
     loops.  Optionally combine a set of torture options with a set of
     other options, as is done with Objective-C runtime options.
'torture-finish'
     Finalize use of torture lists.

 The '.exp' file for a set of tests that use torture options must
include calls to these three procedures if:

   * It calls 'gcc-dg-runtest' and overrides DG_TORTURE_OPTIONS.

   * It calls ${TOOL}'-torture' or ${TOOL}'-torture-execute', where TOOL
     is 'c', 'fortran', or 'objc'.

   * It calls 'dg-pch'.

 It is not necessary for a '.exp' file that calls 'gcc-dg-runtest' to
call the torture procedures if the tests should use the list in
DG_TORTURE_OPTIONS defined in 'gcc-dg.exp'.

 Most uses of torture options can override the default lists by defining
TORTURE_OPTIONS or add to the default list by defining
ADDITIONAL_TORTURE_OPTIONS.  Define these in a '.dejagnurc' file or add
them to the 'site.exp' file; for example

     set ADDITIONAL_TORTURE_OPTIONS  [list \
       { -O2 -ftree-loop-linear } \
       { -O2 -fpeel-loops } ]

8 Option specification files
****************************

Most GCC command-line options are described by special option definition
files, the names of which conventionally end in '.opt'.  This chapter
describes the format of these files.

* Menu:

* Option file format::   The general layout of the files
* Option properties::    Supported option properties


File: gccint.info,  Node: Option file format,  Next: Option properties,  Up: Options

8.1 Option file format
======================

Option files are a simple list of records in which each field occupies
its own line and in which the records themselves are separated by blank
lines.  Comments may appear on their own line anywhere within the file
and are preceded by semicolons.  Whitespace is allowed before the
semicolon.

 The files can contain the following types of record:

   * A language definition record.  These records have two fields: the
     string 'Language' and the name of the language.  Once a language
     has been declared in this way, it can be used as an option
     property.  *Note Option properties::.

   * A target specific save record to save additional information.
     These records have two fields: the string 'TargetSave', and a
     declaration type to go in the 'cl_target_option' structure.

   * A variable record to define a variable used to store option
     information.  These records have two fields: the string 'Variable',
     and a declaration of the type and name of the variable, optionally
     with an initializer (but without any trailing ';').  These records
     may be used for variables used for many options where declaring the
     initializer in a single option definition record, or duplicating it
     in many records, would be inappropriate, or for variables set in
     option handlers rather than referenced by 'Var' properties.

   * A variable record to define a variable used to store option
     information.  These records have two fields: the string
     'TargetVariable', and a declaration of the type and name of the
     variable, optionally with an initializer (but without any trailing
     ';').  'TargetVariable' is a combination of 'Variable' and
     'TargetSave' records in that the variable is defined in the
     'gcc_options' structure, but these variables are also stored in the
     'cl_target_option' structure.  The variables are saved in the
     target save code and restored in the target restore code.

   * A variable record to record any additional files that the
     'options.h' file should include.  This is useful to provide
     enumeration or structure definitions needed for target variables.
     These records have two fields: the string 'HeaderInclude' and the
     name of the include file.

   * A variable record to record any additional files that the
     'options.c' or 'options-save.c' file should include.  This is
     useful to provide inline functions needed for target variables
     and/or '#ifdef' sequences to properly set up the initialization.
     These records have two fields: the string 'SourceInclude' and the
     name of the include file.

   * An enumeration record to define a set of strings that may be used
     as arguments to an option or options.  These records have three
     fields: the string 'Enum', a space-separated list of properties and
     help text used to describe the set of strings in '--help' output.
     Properties use the same format as option properties; the following
     are valid:
     'Name(NAME)'
          This property is required; NAME must be a name (suitable for
          use in C identifiers) used to identify the set of strings in
          'Enum' option properties.

     'Type(TYPE)'
          This property is required; TYPE is the C type for variables
          set by options using this enumeration together with 'Var'.

     'UnknownError(MESSAGE)'
          The message MESSAGE will be used as an error message if the
          argument is invalid; for enumerations without 'UnknownError',
          a generic error message is used.  MESSAGE should contain a
          single '%qs' format, which will be used to format the invalid
          argument.

   * An enumeration value record to define one of the strings in a set
     given in an 'Enum' record.  These records have two fields: the
     string 'EnumValue' and a space-separated list of properties.
     Properties use the same format as option properties; the following
     are valid:
     'Enum(NAME)'
          This property is required; NAME says which 'Enum' record this
          'EnumValue' record corresponds to.

     'String(STRING)'
          This property is required; STRING is the string option
          argument being described by this record.

     'Value(VALUE)'
          This property is required; it says what value (representable
          as 'int') should be used for the given string.

     'Canonical'
          This property is optional.  If present, it says the present
          string is the canonical one among all those with the given
          value.  Other strings yielding that value will be mapped to
          this one so specs do not need to handle them.

     'DriverOnly'
          This property is optional.  If present, the present string
          will only be accepted by the driver.  This is used for cases
          such as '-march=native' that are processed by the driver so
          that 'gcc -v' shows how the options chosen depended on the
          system on which the compiler was run.

   * An option definition record.  These records have the following
     fields:
       1. the name of the option, with the leading "-" removed
       2. a space-separated list of option properties (*note Option
          properties::)
       3. the help text to use for '--help' (omitted if the second field
          contains the 'Undocumented' property).

     By default, all options beginning with "f", "W" or "m" are
     implicitly assumed to take a "no-" form.  This form should not be
     listed separately.  If an option beginning with one of these
     letters does not have a "no-" form, you can use the
     'RejectNegative' property to reject it.

     The help text is automatically line-wrapped before being displayed.
     Normally the name of the option is printed on the left-hand side of
     the output and the help text is printed on the right.  However, if
     the help text contains a tab character, the text to the left of the
     tab is used instead of the option's name and the text to the right
     of the tab forms the help text.  This allows you to elaborate on
     what type of argument the option takes.

   * A target mask record.  These records have one field of the form
     'Mask(X)'.  The options-processing script will automatically
     allocate a bit in 'target_flags' (*note Run-time Target::) for each
     mask name X and set the macro 'MASK_X' to the appropriate bitmask.
     It will also declare a 'TARGET_X' macro that has the value 1 when
     bit 'MASK_X' is set and 0 otherwise.

     They are primarily intended to declare target masks that are not
     associated with user options, either because these masks represent
     internal switches or because the options are not available on all
     configurations and yet the masks always need to be defined.

8.2 Option properties
=====================

The second field of an option record can specify any of the following
properties.  When an option takes an argument, it is enclosed in
parentheses following the option property name.  The parser that handles
option files is quite simplistic, and will be tricked by any nested
parentheses within the argument text itself; in this case, the entire
option argument can be wrapped in curly braces within the parentheses to
demarcate it, e.g.:

     Condition({defined (USE_CYGWIN_LIBSTDCXX_WRAPPERS)})

'Common'
     The option is available for all languages and targets.

'Target'
     The option is available for all languages but is target-specific.

'Driver'
     The option is handled by the compiler driver using code not shared
     with the compilers proper ('cc1' etc.).

'LANGUAGE'
     The option is available when compiling for the given language.

     It is possible to specify several different languages for the same
     option.  Each LANGUAGE must have been declared by an earlier
     'Language' record.  *Note Option file format::.

'RejectDriver'
     The option is only handled by the compilers proper ('cc1' etc.) and
     should not be accepted by the driver.

'RejectNegative'
     The option does not have a "no-" form.  All options beginning with
     "f", "W" or "m" are assumed to have a "no-" form unless this
     property is used.

'Negative(OTHERNAME)'
     The option will turn off another option OTHERNAME, which is the
     option name with the leading "-" removed.  This chain action will
     propagate through the 'Negative' property of the option to be
     turned off.

     As a consequence, if you have a group of mutually-exclusive
     options, their 'Negative' properties should form a circular chain.
     For example, if options '-A', '-B' and '-C' are mutually exclusive,
     their respective 'Negative' properties should be 'Negative(B)',
     'Negative(C)' and 'Negative(A)'.

'Joined'
'Separate'
     The option takes a mandatory argument.  'Joined' indicates that the
     option and argument can be included in the same 'argv' entry (as
     with '-mflush-func=NAME', for example).  'Separate' indicates that
     the option and argument can be separate 'argv' entries (as with
     '-o').  An option is allowed to have both of these properties.

'JoinedOrMissing'
     The option takes an optional argument.  If the argument is given,
     it will be part of the same 'argv' entry as the option itself.

     This property cannot be used alongside 'Joined' or 'Separate'.

'MissingArgError(MESSAGE)'
     For an option marked 'Joined' or 'Separate', the message MESSAGE
     will be used as an error message if the mandatory argument is
     missing; for options without 'MissingArgError', a generic error
     message is used.  MESSAGE should contain a single '%qs' format,
     which will be used to format the name of the option passed.

'Args(N)'
     For an option marked 'Separate', indicate that it takes N
     arguments.  The default is 1.

'UInteger'
     The option's argument is a non-negative integer.  The option parser
     will check and convert the argument before passing it to the
     relevant option handler.  'UInteger' should also be used on options
     like '-falign-loops' where both '-falign-loops' and
     '-falign-loops'=N are supported to make sure the saved options are
     given a full integer.

'ToLower'
     The option's argument should be converted to lowercase as part of
     putting it in canonical form, and before comparing with the strings
     indicated by any 'Enum' property.

'NoDriverArg'
     For an option marked 'Separate', the option only takes an argument
     in the compiler proper, not in the driver.  This is for
     compatibility with existing options that are used both directly and
     via '-Wp,'; new options should not have this property.

'Var(VAR)'
     The state of this option should be stored in variable VAR (actually
     a macro for 'global_options.x_VAR').  The way that the state is
     stored depends on the type of option:

        * If the option uses the 'Mask' or 'InverseMask' properties, VAR
          is the integer variable that contains the mask.

        * If the option is a normal on/off switch, VAR is an integer
          variable that is nonzero when the option is enabled.  The
          options parser will set the variable to 1 when the positive
          form of the option is used and 0 when the "no-" form is used.

        * If the option takes an argument and has the 'UInteger'
          property, VAR is an integer variable that stores the value of
          the argument.

        * If the option takes an argument and has the 'Enum' property,
          VAR is a variable (type given in the 'Type' property of the
          'Enum' record whose 'Name' property has the same argument as
          the 'Enum' property of this option) that stores the value of
          the argument.

        * If the option has the 'Defer' property, VAR is a pointer to a
          'VEC(cl_deferred_option,heap)' that stores the option for
          later processing.  (VAR is declared with type 'void *' and
          needs to be cast to 'VEC(cl_deferred_option,heap)' before
          use.)

        * Otherwise, if the option takes an argument, VAR is a pointer
          to the argument string.  The pointer will be null if the
          argument is optional and wasn't given.

     The option-processing script will usually zero-initialize VAR.  You
     can modify this behavior using 'Init'.

'Var(VAR, SET)'
     The option controls an integer variable VAR and is active when VAR
     equals SET.  The option parser will set VAR to SET when the
     positive form of the option is used and '!SET' when the "no-" form
     is used.

     VAR is declared in the same way as for the single-argument form
     described above.

'Init(VALUE)'
     The variable specified by the 'Var' property should be statically
     initialized to VALUE.  If more than one option using the same
     variable specifies 'Init', all must specify the same initializer.

'Mask(NAME)'
     The option is associated with a bit in the 'target_flags' variable
     (*note Run-time Target::) and is active when that bit is set.  You
     may also specify 'Var' to select a variable other than
     'target_flags'.

     The options-processing script will automatically allocate a unique
     bit for the option.  If the option is attached to 'target_flags',
     the script will set the macro 'MASK_NAME' to the appropriate
     bitmask.  It will also declare a 'TARGET_NAME' macro that has the
     value 1 when the option is active and 0 otherwise.  If you use
     'Var' to attach the option to a different variable, the bitmask
     macro with be called 'OPTION_MASK_NAME'.

'InverseMask(OTHERNAME)'
'InverseMask(OTHERNAME, THISNAME)'
     The option is the inverse of another option that has the
     'Mask(OTHERNAME)' property.  If THISNAME is given, the
     options-processing script will declare a 'TARGET_THISNAME' macro
     that is 1 when the option is active and 0 otherwise.

'Enum(NAME)'
     The option's argument is a string from the set of strings
     associated with the corresponding 'Enum' record.  The string is
     checked and converted to the integer specified in the corresponding
     'EnumValue' record before being passed to option handlers.

'Defer'
     The option should be stored in a vector, specified with 'Var', for
     later processing.

'Alias(OPT)'
'Alias(OPT, ARG)'
'Alias(OPT, POSARG, NEGARG)'
     The option is an alias for '-OPT' (or the negative form of that
     option, depending on 'NegativeAlias').  In the first form, any
     argument passed to the alias is considered to be passed to '-OPT',
     and '-OPT' is considered to be negated if the alias is used in
     negated form.  In the second form, the alias may not be negated or
     have an argument, and POSARG is considered to be passed as an
     argument to '-OPT'.  In the third form, the alias may not have an
     argument, if the alias is used in the positive form then POSARG is
     considered to be passed to '-OPT', and if the alias is used in the
     negative form then NEGARG is considered to be passed to '-OPT'.

     Aliases should not specify 'Var' or 'Mask' or 'UInteger'.  Aliases
     should normally specify the same languages as the target of the
     alias; the flags on the target will be used to determine any
     diagnostic for use of an option for the wrong language, while those
     on the alias will be used to identify what command-line text is the
     option and what text is any argument to that option.

     When an 'Alias' definition is used for an option, driver specs do
     not need to handle it and no 'OPT_' enumeration value is defined
     for it; only the canonical form of the option will be seen in those
     places.

'NegativeAlias'
     For an option marked with 'Alias(OPT)', the option is considered to
     be an alias for the positive form of '-OPT' if negated and for the
     negative form of '-OPT' if not negated.  'NegativeAlias' may not be
     used with the forms of 'Alias' taking more than one argument.

'Ignore'
     This option is ignored apart from printing any warning specified
     using 'Warn'.  The option will not be seen by specs and no 'OPT_'
     enumeration value is defined for it.

'SeparateAlias'
     For an option marked with 'Joined', 'Separate' and 'Alias', the
     option only acts as an alias when passed a separate argument; with
     a joined argument it acts as a normal option, with an 'OPT_'
     enumeration value.  This is for compatibility with the Java '-d'
     option and should not be used for new options.

'Warn(MESSAGE)'
     If this option is used, output the warning MESSAGE.  MESSAGE is a
     format string, either taking a single operand with a '%qs' format
     which is the option name, or not taking any operands, which is
     passed to the 'warning' function.  If an alias is marked 'Warn',
     the target of the alias must not also be marked 'Warn'.

'Report'
     The state of the option should be printed by '-fverbose-asm'.

'Warning'
     This is a warning option and should be shown as such in '--help'
     output.  This flag does not currently affect anything other than
     '--help'.

'Optimization'
     This is an optimization option.  It should be shown as such in
     '--help' output, and any associated variable named using 'Var'
     should be saved and restored when the optimization level is changed
     with 'optimize' attributes.

'Undocumented'
     The option is deliberately missing documentation and should not be
     included in the '--help' output.

'Condition(COND)'
     The option should only be accepted if preprocessor condition COND
     is true.  Note that any C declarations associated with the option
     will be present even if COND is false; COND simply controls whether
     the option is accepted and whether it is printed in the '--help'
     output.

'Save'
     Build the 'cl_target_option' structure to hold a copy of the
     option, add the functions 'cl_target_option_save' and
     'cl_target_option_restore' to save and restore the options.

'SetByCombined'
     The option may also be set by a combined option such as
     '-ffast-math'.  This causes the 'gcc_options' struct to have a
     field 'frontend_set_NAME', where 'NAME' is the name of the field
     holding the value of this option (without the leading 'x_').  This
     gives the front end a way to indicate that the value has been set
     explicitly and should not be changed by the combined option.  For
     example, some front ends use this to prevent '-ffast-math' and
     '-fno-fast-math' from changing the value of '-fmath-errno' for
     languages that do not use 'errno'.

'EnabledBy(OPT)'
'EnabledBy(OPT && OPT2)'
     If not explicitly set, the option is set to the value of '-OPT'.
     The second form specifies that the option is only set if both OPT
     and OPT2 are set.

'LangEnabledBy(LANGUAGE, OPT)'
'LangEnabledBy(LANGUAGE, OPT, POSARG, NEGARG)'
     When compiling for the given language, the option is set to the
     value of '-OPT', if not explicitly set.  In the second form, if OPT
     is used in the positive form then POSARG is considered to be passed
     to the option, and if OPT is used in the negative form then NEGARG
     is considered to be passed to the option.  It is possible to
     specify several different languages.  Each LANGUAGE must have been
     declared by an earlier 'Language' record.  *Note Option file
     format::.

'NoDWARFRecord'
     The option is omitted from the producer string written by
     '-grecord-gcc-switches'.

'PchIgnore'
     Even if this is a target option, this option will not be recorded /
     compared to determine if a precompiled header file matches.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Parsing pass,  Next: Cilk Plus Transformation,  Up: Passes

9.1 Parsing pass
================

The language front end is invoked only once, via
'lang_hooks.parse_file', to parse the entire input.  The language front
end may use any intermediate language representation deemed appropriate.
The C front end uses GENERIC trees (*note GENERIC::), plus a double
handful of language specific tree codes defined in 'c-common.def'.  The
Fortran front end uses a completely different private representation.

 At some point the front end must translate the representation used in
the front end to a representation understood by the language-independent
portions of the compiler.  Current practice takes one of two forms.  The
C front end manually invokes the gimplifier (*note GIMPLE::) on each
function, and uses the gimplifier callbacks to convert the
language-specific tree nodes directly to GIMPLE before passing the
function off to be compiled.  The Fortran front end converts from a
private representation to GENERIC, which is later lowered to GIMPLE when
the function is compiled.  Which route to choose probably depends on how
well GENERIC (plus extensions) can be made to match up with the source
language and necessary parsing data structures.

 BUG: Gimplification must occur before nested function lowering, and
nested function lowering must be done by the front end before passing
the data off to cgraph.

 TODO: Cgraph should control nested function lowering.  It would only be
invoked when it is certain that the outer-most function is used.

 TODO: Cgraph needs a gimplify_function callback.  It should be invoked
when (1) it is certain that the function is used, (2) warning flags
specified by the user require some amount of compilation in order to
honor, (3) the language indicates that semantic analysis is not complete
until gimplification occurs.  Hum... this sounds overly complicated.
Perhaps we should just have the front end gimplify always; in most cases
it's only one function call.

 The front end needs to pass all function definitions and top level
declarations off to the middle-end so that they can be compiled and
emitted to the object file.  For a simple procedural language, it is
usually most convenient to do this as each top level declaration or
definition is seen.  There is also a distinction to be made between
generating functional code and generating complete debug information.
The only thing that is absolutely required for functional code is that
function and data _definitions_ be passed to the middle-end.  For
complete debug information, function, data and type declarations should
all be passed as well.

 In any case, the front end needs each complete top-level function or
data declaration, and each data definition should be passed to
'rest_of_decl_compilation'.  Each complete type definition should be
passed to 'rest_of_type_compilation'.  Each function definition should
be passed to 'cgraph_finalize_function'.

 TODO: I know rest_of_compilation currently has all sorts of RTL
generation semantics.  I plan to move all code generation bits (both
Tree and RTL) to compile_function.  Should we hide cgraph from the front
ends and move back to rest_of_compilation as the official interface?
Possibly we should rename all three interfaces such that the names match
in some meaningful way and that is more descriptive than "rest_of".

 The middle-end will, at its option, emit the function and data
definitions immediately or queue them for later processing.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Cilk Plus Transformation,  Next: Gimplification pass,  Prev: Parsing pass,  Up: Passes

9.2 Cilk Plus Transformation
============================

If Cilk Plus generation (flag '-fcilkplus') is enabled, all the Cilk
Plus code is transformed into equivalent C and C++ functions.  Majority
of this transformation occurs toward the end of the parsing and right
before the gimplification pass.

 These are the major components to the Cilk Plus language extension:
   * Array Notations: During parsing phase, all the array notation
     specific information is stored in 'ARRAY_NOTATION_REF' tree using
     the function 'c_parser_array_notation'.  During the end of parsing,
     we check the entire function to see if there are any array notation
     specific code (using the function 'contains_array_notation_expr').
     If this function returns true, then we expand them using either
     'expand_array_notation_exprs' or 'build_array_notation_expr'.  For
     the cases where array notations are inside conditions, they are
     transformed using the function 'fix_conditional_array_notations'.
     The C language-specific routines are located in
     'c/c-array-notation.c' and the equivalent C++ routines are in the
     file 'cp/cp-array-notation.c'.  Common routines such as functions
     to initialize built-in functions are stored in
     'array-notation-common.c'.

   * Cilk keywords:
        * '_Cilk_spawn': The '_Cilk_spawn' keyword is parsed and the
          function it contains is marked as a spawning function.  The
          spawning function is called the spawner.  At the end of the
          parsing phase, appropriate built-in functions are added to the
          spawner that are defined in the Cilk runtime.  The appropriate
          locations of these functions, and the internal structures are
          detailed in 'cilk_init_builtins' in the file 'cilk-common.c'.
          The pointers to Cilk functions and fields of internal
          structures are described in 'cilk.h'.  The built-in functions
          are described in 'cilk-builtins.def'.

          During gimplification, a new "spawn-helper" function is
          created.  The spawned function is replaced with a spawn helper
          function in the spawner.  The spawned function-call is moved
          into the spawn helper.  The main function that does these
          transformations is 'gimplify_cilk_spawn' in 'c-family/cilk.c'.
          In the spawn-helper, the gimplification function
          'gimplify_call_expr', inserts a function call
          '__cilkrts_detach'.  This function is expanded by
          'builtin_expand_cilk_detach' located in 'c-family/cilk.c'.

        * '_Cilk_sync': '_Cilk_sync' is parsed like a keyword.  During
          gimplification, the function 'gimplify_cilk_sync' in
          'c-family/cilk.c', will replace this keyword with a set of
          functions that are stored in the Cilk runtime.  One of the
          internal functions inserted during gimplification,
          '__cilkrts_pop_frame' must be expanded by the compiler and is
          done by 'builtin_expand_cilk_pop_frame' in 'cilk-common.c'.

 Documentation about Cilk Plus and language specification is provided
under the "Learn" section in <http://www.cilkplus.org/>.  It is worth
mentioning that the current implementation follows ABI 1.1.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Gimplification pass,  Next: Pass manager,  Prev: Cilk Plus Transformation,  Up: Passes

9.3 Gimplification pass
=======================

"Gimplification" is a whimsical term for the process of converting the
intermediate representation of a function into the GIMPLE language
(*note GIMPLE::).  The term stuck, and so words like "gimplification",
"gimplify", "gimplifier" and the like are sprinkled throughout this
section of code.

 While a front end may certainly choose to generate GIMPLE directly if
it chooses, this can be a moderately complex process unless the
intermediate language used by the front end is already fairly simple.
Usually it is easier to generate GENERIC trees plus extensions and let
the language-independent gimplifier do most of the work.

 The main entry point to this pass is 'gimplify_function_tree' located
in 'gimplify.c'.  From here we process the entire function gimplifying
each statement in turn.  The main workhorse for this pass is
'gimplify_expr'.  Approximately everything passes through here at least
once, and it is from here that we invoke the 'lang_hooks.gimplify_expr'
callback.

 The callback should examine the expression in question and return
'GS_UNHANDLED' if the expression is not a language specific construct
that requires attention.  Otherwise it should alter the expression in
some way to such that forward progress is made toward producing valid
GIMPLE.  If the callback is certain that the transformation is complete
and the expression is valid GIMPLE, it should return 'GS_ALL_DONE'.
Otherwise it should return 'GS_OK', which will cause the expression to
be processed again.  If the callback encounters an error during the
transformation (because the front end is relying on the gimplification
process to finish semantic checks), it should return 'GS_ERROR'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Pass manager,  Next: Tree SSA passes,  Prev: Gimplification pass,  Up: Passes

9.4 Pass manager
================

The pass manager is located in 'passes.c', 'tree-optimize.c' and
'tree-pass.h'.  It processes passes as described in 'passes.def'.  Its
job is to run all of the individual passes in the correct order, and
take care of standard bookkeeping that applies to every pass.

 The theory of operation is that each pass defines a structure that
represents everything we need to know about that pass--when it should be
run, how it should be run, what intermediate language form or
on-the-side data structures it needs.  We register the pass to be run in
some particular order, and the pass manager arranges for everything to
happen in the correct order.

 The actuality doesn't completely live up to the theory at present.
Command-line switches and 'timevar_id_t' enumerations must still be
defined elsewhere.  The pass manager validates constraints but does not
attempt to (re-)generate data structures or lower intermediate language
form based on the requirements of the next pass.  Nevertheless, what is
present is useful, and a far sight better than nothing at all.

 Each pass should have a unique name.  Each pass may have its own dump
file (for GCC debugging purposes).  Passes with a name starting with a
star do not dump anything.  Sometimes passes are supposed to share a
dump file / option name.  To still give these unique names, you can use
a prefix that is delimited by a space from the part that is used for the
dump file / option name.  E.g.  When the pass name is "ud dce", the name
used for dump file/options is "dce".

 TODO: describe the global variables set up by the pass manager, and a
brief description of how a new pass should use it.  I need to look at
what info RTL passes use first...

9.5 Tree SSA passes
===================

The following briefly describes the Tree optimization passes that are
run after gimplification and what source files they are located in.

   * Remove useless statements

     This pass is an extremely simple sweep across the gimple code in
     which we identify obviously dead code and remove it.  Here we do
     things like simplify 'if' statements with constant conditions,
     remove exception handling constructs surrounding code that
     obviously cannot throw, remove lexical bindings that contain no
     variables, and other assorted simplistic cleanups.  The idea is to
     get rid of the obvious stuff quickly rather than wait until later
     when it's more work to get rid of it.  This pass is located in
     'tree-cfg.c' and described by 'pass_remove_useless_stmts'.

   * OpenMP lowering

     If OpenMP generation ('-fopenmp') is enabled, this pass lowers
     OpenMP constructs into GIMPLE.

     Lowering of OpenMP constructs involves creating replacement
     expressions for local variables that have been mapped using data
     sharing clauses, exposing the control flow of most synchronization
     directives and adding region markers to facilitate the creation of
     the control flow graph.  The pass is located in 'omp-low.c' and is
     described by 'pass_lower_omp'.

   * OpenMP expansion

     If OpenMP generation ('-fopenmp') is enabled, this pass expands
     parallel regions into their own functions to be invoked by the
     thread library.  The pass is located in 'omp-low.c' and is
     described by 'pass_expand_omp'.

   * Lower control flow

     This pass flattens 'if' statements ('COND_EXPR') and moves lexical
     bindings ('BIND_EXPR') out of line.  After this pass, all 'if'
     statements will have exactly two 'goto' statements in its 'then'
     and 'else' arms.  Lexical binding information for each statement
     will be found in 'TREE_BLOCK' rather than being inferred from its
     position under a 'BIND_EXPR'.  This pass is found in 'gimple-low.c'
     and is described by 'pass_lower_cf'.

   * Lower exception handling control flow

     This pass decomposes high-level exception handling constructs
     ('TRY_FINALLY_EXPR' and 'TRY_CATCH_EXPR') into a form that
     explicitly represents the control flow involved.  After this pass,
     'lookup_stmt_eh_region' will return a non-negative number for any
     statement that may have EH control flow semantics; examine
     'tree_can_throw_internal' or 'tree_can_throw_external' for exact
     semantics.  Exact control flow may be extracted from
     'foreach_reachable_handler'.  The EH region nesting tree is defined
     in 'except.h' and built in 'except.c'.  The lowering pass itself is
     in 'tree-eh.c' and is described by 'pass_lower_eh'.

   * Build the control flow graph

     This pass decomposes a function into basic blocks and creates all
     of the edges that connect them.  It is located in 'tree-cfg.c' and
     is described by 'pass_build_cfg'.

   * Find all referenced variables

     This pass walks the entire function and collects an array of all
     variables referenced in the function, 'referenced_vars'.  The index
     at which a variable is found in the array is used as a UID for the
     variable within this function.  This data is needed by the SSA
     rewriting routines.  The pass is located in 'tree-dfa.c' and is
     described by 'pass_referenced_vars'.

   * Enter static single assignment form

     This pass rewrites the function such that it is in SSA form.  After
     this pass, all 'is_gimple_reg' variables will be referenced by
     'SSA_NAME', and all occurrences of other variables will be
     annotated with 'VDEFS' and 'VUSES'; PHI nodes will have been
     inserted as necessary for each basic block.  This pass is located
     in 'tree-ssa.c' and is described by 'pass_build_ssa'.

   * Warn for uninitialized variables

     This pass scans the function for uses of 'SSA_NAME's that are fed
     by default definition.  For non-parameter variables, such uses are
     uninitialized.  The pass is run twice, before and after
     optimization (if turned on).  In the first pass we only warn for
     uses that are positively uninitialized; in the second pass we warn
     for uses that are possibly uninitialized.  The pass is located in
     'tree-ssa.c' and is defined by 'pass_early_warn_uninitialized' and
     'pass_late_warn_uninitialized'.

   * Dead code elimination

     This pass scans the function for statements without side effects
     whose result is unused.  It does not do memory life analysis, so
     any value that is stored in memory is considered used.  The pass is
     run multiple times throughout the optimization process.  It is
     located in 'tree-ssa-dce.c' and is described by 'pass_dce'.

   * Dominator optimizations

     This pass performs trivial dominator-based copy and constant
     propagation, expression simplification, and jump threading.  It is
     run multiple times throughout the optimization process.  It is
     located in 'tree-ssa-dom.c' and is described by 'pass_dominator'.

   * Forward propagation of single-use variables

     This pass attempts to remove redundant computation by substituting
     variables that are used once into the expression that uses them and
     seeing if the result can be simplified.  It is located in
     'tree-ssa-forwprop.c' and is described by 'pass_forwprop'.

   * Copy Renaming

     This pass attempts to change the name of compiler temporaries
     involved in copy operations such that SSA->normal can coalesce the
     copy away.  When compiler temporaries are copies of user variables,
     it also renames the compiler temporary to the user variable
     resulting in better use of user symbols.  It is located in
     'tree-ssa-copyrename.c' and is described by 'pass_copyrename'.

   * PHI node optimizations

     This pass recognizes forms of PHI inputs that can be represented as
     conditional expressions and rewrites them into straight line code.
     It is located in 'tree-ssa-phiopt.c' and is described by
     'pass_phiopt'.

   * May-alias optimization

     This pass performs a flow sensitive SSA-based points-to analysis.
     The resulting may-alias, must-alias, and escape analysis
     information is used to promote variables from in-memory addressable
     objects to non-aliased variables that can be renamed into SSA form.
     We also update the 'VDEF'/'VUSE' memory tags for non-renameable
     aggregates so that we get fewer false kills.  The pass is located
     in 'tree-ssa-alias.c' and is described by 'pass_may_alias'.

     Interprocedural points-to information is located in
     'tree-ssa-structalias.c' and described by 'pass_ipa_pta'.

   * Profiling

     This pass rewrites the function in order to collect runtime block
     and value profiling data.  Such data may be fed back into the
     compiler on a subsequent run so as to allow optimization based on
     expected execution frequencies.  The pass is located in 'predict.c'
     and is described by 'pass_profile'.

   * Lower complex arithmetic

     This pass rewrites complex arithmetic operations into their
     component scalar arithmetic operations.  The pass is located in
     'tree-complex.c' and is described by 'pass_lower_complex'.

   * Scalar replacement of aggregates

     This pass rewrites suitable non-aliased local aggregate variables
     into a set of scalar variables.  The resulting scalar variables are
     rewritten into SSA form, which allows subsequent optimization
     passes to do a significantly better job with them.  The pass is
     located in 'tree-sra.c' and is described by 'pass_sra'.

   * Dead store elimination

     This pass eliminates stores to memory that are subsequently
     overwritten by another store, without any intervening loads.  The
     pass is located in 'tree-ssa-dse.c' and is described by 'pass_dse'.

   * Tail recursion elimination

     This pass transforms tail recursion into a loop.  It is located in
     'tree-tailcall.c' and is described by 'pass_tail_recursion'.

   * Forward store motion

     This pass sinks stores and assignments down the flowgraph closer to
     their use point.  The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-sink.c' and is
     described by 'pass_sink_code'.

   * Partial redundancy elimination

     This pass eliminates partially redundant computations, as well as
     performing load motion.  The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-pre.c'
     and is described by 'pass_pre'.

     Just before partial redundancy elimination, if
     '-funsafe-math-optimizations' is on, GCC tries to convert divisions
     to multiplications by the reciprocal.  The pass is located in
     'tree-ssa-math-opts.c' and is described by 'pass_cse_reciprocal'.

   * Full redundancy elimination

     This is a simpler form of PRE that only eliminates redundancies
     that occur on all paths.  It is located in 'tree-ssa-pre.c' and
     described by 'pass_fre'.

   * Loop optimization

     The main driver of the pass is placed in 'tree-ssa-loop.c' and
     described by 'pass_loop'.

     The optimizations performed by this pass are:

     Loop invariant motion.  This pass moves only invariants that would
     be hard to handle on RTL level (function calls, operations that
     expand to nontrivial sequences of insns).  With '-funswitch-loops'
     it also moves operands of conditions that are invariant out of the
     loop, so that we can use just trivial invariantness analysis in
     loop unswitching.  The pass also includes store motion.  The pass
     is implemented in 'tree-ssa-loop-im.c'.

     Canonical induction variable creation.  This pass creates a simple
     counter for number of iterations of the loop and replaces the exit
     condition of the loop using it, in case when a complicated analysis
     is necessary to determine the number of iterations.  Later
     optimizations then may determine the number easily.  The pass is
     implemented in 'tree-ssa-loop-ivcanon.c'.

     Induction variable optimizations.  This pass performs standard
     induction variable optimizations, including strength reduction,
     induction variable merging and induction variable elimination.  The
     pass is implemented in 'tree-ssa-loop-ivopts.c'.

     Loop unswitching.  This pass moves the conditional jumps that are
     invariant out of the loops.  To achieve this, a duplicate of the
     loop is created for each possible outcome of conditional jump(s).
     The pass is implemented in 'tree-ssa-loop-unswitch.c'.  This pass
     should eventually replace the RTL level loop unswitching in
     'loop-unswitch.c', but currently the RTL level pass is not
     completely redundant yet due to deficiencies in tree level alias
     analysis.

     The optimizations also use various utility functions contained in
     'tree-ssa-loop-manip.c', 'cfgloop.c', 'cfgloopanal.c' and
     'cfgloopmanip.c'.

     Vectorization.  This pass transforms loops to operate on vector
     types instead of scalar types.  Data parallelism across loop
     iterations is exploited to group data elements from consecutive
     iterations into a vector and operate on them in parallel.
     Depending on available target support the loop is conceptually
     unrolled by a factor 'VF' (vectorization factor), which is the
     number of elements operated upon in parallel in each iteration, and
     the 'VF' copies of each scalar operation are fused to form a vector
     operation.  Additional loop transformations such as peeling and
     versioning may take place to align the number of iterations, and to
     align the memory accesses in the loop.  The pass is implemented in
     'tree-vectorizer.c' (the main driver), 'tree-vect-loop.c' and
     'tree-vect-loop-manip.c' (loop specific parts and general loop
     utilities), 'tree-vect-slp' (loop-aware SLP functionality),
     'tree-vect-stmts.c' and 'tree-vect-data-refs.c'.  Analysis of data
     references is in 'tree-data-ref.c'.

     SLP Vectorization.  This pass performs vectorization of
     straight-line code.  The pass is implemented in 'tree-vectorizer.c'
     (the main driver), 'tree-vect-slp.c', 'tree-vect-stmts.c' and
     'tree-vect-data-refs.c'.

     Autoparallelization.  This pass splits the loop iteration space to
     run into several threads.  The pass is implemented in
     'tree-parloops.c'.

     Graphite is a loop transformation framework based on the polyhedral
     model.  Graphite stands for Gimple Represented as Polyhedra.  The
     internals of this infrastructure are documented in
     <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Graphite>.  The passes working on this
     representation are implemented in the various 'graphite-*' files.

   * Tree level if-conversion for vectorizer

     This pass applies if-conversion to simple loops to help vectorizer.
     We identify if convertible loops, if-convert statements and merge
     basic blocks in one big block.  The idea is to present loop in such
     form so that vectorizer can have one to one mapping between
     statements and available vector operations.  This pass is located
     in 'tree-if-conv.c' and is described by 'pass_if_conversion'.

   * Conditional constant propagation

     This pass relaxes a lattice of values in order to identify those
     that must be constant even in the presence of conditional branches.
     The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-ccp.c' and is described by
     'pass_ccp'.

     A related pass that works on memory loads and stores, and not just
     register values, is located in 'tree-ssa-ccp.c' and described by
     'pass_store_ccp'.

   * Conditional copy propagation

     This is similar to constant propagation but the lattice of values
     is the "copy-of" relation.  It eliminates redundant copies from the
     code.  The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-copy.c' and described by
     'pass_copy_prop'.

     A related pass that works on memory copies, and not just register
     copies, is located in 'tree-ssa-copy.c' and described by
     'pass_store_copy_prop'.

   * Value range propagation

     This transformation is similar to constant propagation but instead
     of propagating single constant values, it propagates known value
     ranges.  The implementation is based on Patterson's range
     propagation algorithm (Accurate Static Branch Prediction by Value
     Range Propagation, J. R. C. Patterson, PLDI '95).  In contrast to
     Patterson's algorithm, this implementation does not propagate
     branch probabilities nor it uses more than a single range per SSA
     name.  This means that the current implementation cannot be used
     for branch prediction (though adapting it would not be difficult).
     The pass is located in 'tree-vrp.c' and is described by 'pass_vrp'.

   * Folding built-in functions

     This pass simplifies built-in functions, as applicable, with
     constant arguments or with inferable string lengths.  It is located
     in 'tree-ssa-ccp.c' and is described by 'pass_fold_builtins'.

   * Split critical edges

     This pass identifies critical edges and inserts empty basic blocks
     such that the edge is no longer critical.  The pass is located in
     'tree-cfg.c' and is described by 'pass_split_crit_edges'.

   * Control dependence dead code elimination

     This pass is a stronger form of dead code elimination that can
     eliminate unnecessary control flow statements.  It is located in
     'tree-ssa-dce.c' and is described by 'pass_cd_dce'.

   * Tail call elimination

     This pass identifies function calls that may be rewritten into
     jumps.  No code transformation is actually applied here, but the
     data and control flow problem is solved.  The code transformation
     requires target support, and so is delayed until RTL.  In the
     meantime 'CALL_EXPR_TAILCALL' is set indicating the possibility.
     The pass is located in 'tree-tailcall.c' and is described by
     'pass_tail_calls'.  The RTL transformation is handled by
     'fixup_tail_calls' in 'calls.c'.

   * Warn for function return without value

     For non-void functions, this pass locates return statements that do
     not specify a value and issues a warning.  Such a statement may
     have been injected by falling off the end of the function.  This
     pass is run last so that we have as much time as possible to prove
     that the statement is not reachable.  It is located in 'tree-cfg.c'
     and is described by 'pass_warn_function_return'.

   * Leave static single assignment form

     This pass rewrites the function such that it is in normal form.  At
     the same time, we eliminate as many single-use temporaries as
     possible, so the intermediate language is no longer GIMPLE, but
     GENERIC.  The pass is located in 'tree-outof-ssa.c' and is
     described by 'pass_del_ssa'.

   * Merge PHI nodes that feed into one another

     This is part of the CFG cleanup passes.  It attempts to join PHI
     nodes from a forwarder CFG block into another block with PHI nodes.
     The pass is located in 'tree-cfgcleanup.c' and is described by
     'pass_merge_phi'.

   * Return value optimization

     If a function always returns the same local variable, and that
     local variable is an aggregate type, then the variable is replaced
     with the return value for the function (i.e., the function's
     DECL_RESULT). This is equivalent to the C++ named return value
     optimization applied to GIMPLE.  The pass is located in
     'tree-nrv.c' and is described by 'pass_nrv'.

   * Return slot optimization

     If a function returns a memory object and is called as 'var =
     foo()', this pass tries to change the call so that the address of
     'var' is sent to the caller to avoid an extra memory copy.  This
     pass is located in 'tree-nrv.c' and is described by
     'pass_return_slot'.

   * Optimize calls to '__builtin_object_size'

     This is a propagation pass similar to CCP that tries to remove
     calls to '__builtin_object_size' when the size of the object can be
     computed at compile-time.  This pass is located in
     'tree-object-size.c' and is described by 'pass_object_sizes'.

   * Loop invariant motion

     This pass removes expensive loop-invariant computations out of
     loops.  The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-loop.c' and described by
     'pass_lim'.

   * Loop nest optimizations

     This is a family of loop transformations that works on loop nests.
     It includes loop interchange, scaling, skewing and reversal and
     they are all geared to the optimization of data locality in array
     traversals and the removal of dependencies that hamper
     optimizations such as loop parallelization and vectorization.  The
     pass is located in 'tree-loop-linear.c' and described by
     'pass_linear_transform'.

   * Removal of empty loops

     This pass removes loops with no code in them.  The pass is located
     in 'tree-ssa-loop-ivcanon.c' and described by 'pass_empty_loop'.

   * Unrolling of small loops

     This pass completely unrolls loops with few iterations.  The pass
     is located in 'tree-ssa-loop-ivcanon.c' and described by
     'pass_complete_unroll'.

   * Predictive commoning

     This pass makes the code reuse the computations from the previous
     iterations of the loops, especially loads and stores to memory.  It
     does so by storing the values of these computations to a bank of
     temporary variables that are rotated at the end of loop.  To avoid
     the need for this rotation, the loop is then unrolled and the
     copies of the loop body are rewritten to use the appropriate
     version of the temporary variable.  This pass is located in
     'tree-predcom.c' and described by 'pass_predcom'.

   * Array prefetching

     This pass issues prefetch instructions for array references inside
     loops.  The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-loop-prefetch.c' and
     described by 'pass_loop_prefetch'.

   * Reassociation

     This pass rewrites arithmetic expressions to enable optimizations
     that operate on them, like redundancy elimination and
     vectorization.  The pass is located in 'tree-ssa-reassoc.c' and
     described by 'pass_reassoc'.

   * Optimization of 'stdarg' functions

     This pass tries to avoid the saving of register arguments into the
     stack on entry to 'stdarg' functions.  If the function doesn't use
     any 'va_start' macros, no registers need to be saved.  If
     'va_start' macros are used, the 'va_list' variables don't escape
     the function, it is only necessary to save registers that will be
     used in 'va_arg' macros.  For instance, if 'va_arg' is only used
     with integral types in the function, floating point registers don't
     need to be saved.  This pass is located in 'tree-stdarg.c' and
     described by 'pass_stdarg'.

9.6 RTL passes
==============

The following briefly describes the RTL generation and optimization
passes that are run after the Tree optimization passes.

   * RTL generation

     The source files for RTL generation include 'stmt.c', 'calls.c',
     'expr.c', 'explow.c', 'expmed.c', 'function.c', 'optabs.c' and
     'emit-rtl.c'.  Also, the file 'insn-emit.c', generated from the
     machine description by the program 'genemit', is used in this pass.
     The header file 'expr.h' is used for communication within this
     pass.

     The header files 'insn-flags.h' and 'insn-codes.h', generated from
     the machine description by the programs 'genflags' and 'gencodes',
     tell this pass which standard names are available for use and which
     patterns correspond to them.

   * Generation of exception landing pads

     This pass generates the glue that handles communication between the
     exception handling library routines and the exception handlers
     within the function.  Entry points in the function that are invoked
     by the exception handling library are called "landing pads".  The
     code for this pass is located in 'except.c'.

   * Control flow graph cleanup

     This pass removes unreachable code, simplifies jumps to next, jumps
     to jump, jumps across jumps, etc.  The pass is run multiple times.
     For historical reasons, it is occasionally referred to as the "jump
     optimization pass".  The bulk of the code for this pass is in
     'cfgcleanup.c', and there are support routines in 'cfgrtl.c' and
     'jump.c'.

   * Forward propagation of single-def values

     This pass attempts to remove redundant computation by substituting
     variables that come from a single definition, and seeing if the
     result can be simplified.  It performs copy propagation and
     addressing mode selection.  The pass is run twice, with values
     being propagated into loops only on the second run.  The code is
     located in 'fwprop.c'.

   * Common subexpression elimination

     This pass removes redundant computation within basic blocks, and
     optimizes addressing modes based on cost.  The pass is run twice.
     The code for this pass is located in 'cse.c'.

   * Global common subexpression elimination

     This pass performs two different types of GCSE depending on whether
     you are optimizing for size or not (LCM based GCSE tends to
     increase code size for a gain in speed, while Morel-Renvoise based
     GCSE does not).  When optimizing for size, GCSE is done using
     Morel-Renvoise Partial Redundancy Elimination, with the exception
     that it does not try to move invariants out of loops--that is left
     to the loop optimization pass.  If MR PRE GCSE is done, code
     hoisting (aka unification) is also done, as well as load motion.
     If you are optimizing for speed, LCM (lazy code motion) based GCSE
     is done.  LCM is based on the work of Knoop, Ruthing, and Steffen.
     LCM based GCSE also does loop invariant code motion.  We also
     perform load and store motion when optimizing for speed.
     Regardless of which type of GCSE is used, the GCSE pass also
     performs global constant and copy propagation.  The source file for
     this pass is 'gcse.c', and the LCM routines are in 'lcm.c'.

   * Loop optimization

     This pass performs several loop related optimizations.  The source
     files 'cfgloopanal.c' and 'cfgloopmanip.c' contain generic loop
     analysis and manipulation code.  Initialization and finalization of
     loop structures is handled by 'loop-init.c'.  A loop invariant
     motion pass is implemented in 'loop-invariant.c'.  Basic block
     level optimizations--unrolling, peeling and unswitching loops-- are
     implemented in 'loop-unswitch.c' and 'loop-unroll.c'.  Replacing of
     the exit condition of loops by special machine-dependent
     instructions is handled by 'loop-doloop.c'.

   * Jump bypassing

     This pass is an aggressive form of GCSE that transforms the control
     flow graph of a function by propagating constants into conditional
     branch instructions.  The source file for this pass is 'gcse.c'.

   * If conversion

     This pass attempts to replace conditional branches and surrounding
     assignments with arithmetic, boolean value producing comparison
     instructions, and conditional move instructions.  In the very last
     invocation after reload/LRA, it will generate predicated
     instructions when supported by the target.  The code is located in
     'ifcvt.c'.

   * Web construction

     This pass splits independent uses of each pseudo-register.  This
     can improve effect of the other transformation, such as CSE or
     register allocation.  The code for this pass is located in 'web.c'.

   * Instruction combination

     This pass attempts to combine groups of two or three instructions
     that are related by data flow into single instructions.  It
     combines the RTL expressions for the instructions by substitution,
     simplifies the result using algebra, and then attempts to match the
     result against the machine description.  The code is located in
     'combine.c'.

   * Mode switching optimization

     This pass looks for instructions that require the processor to be
     in a specific "mode" and minimizes the number of mode changes
     required to satisfy all users.  What these modes are, and what they
     apply to are completely target-specific.  The code for this pass is
     located in 'mode-switching.c'.

   * Modulo scheduling

     This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their instructions
     by overlapping different iterations.  Modulo scheduling is
     performed immediately before instruction scheduling.  The code for
     this pass is located in 'modulo-sched.c'.

   * Instruction scheduling

     This pass looks for instructions whose output will not be available
     by the time that it is used in subsequent instructions.  Memory
     loads and floating point instructions often have this behavior on
     RISC machines.  It re-orders instructions within a basic block to
     try to separate the definition and use of items that otherwise
     would cause pipeline stalls.  This pass is performed twice, before
     and after register allocation.  The code for this pass is located
     in 'haifa-sched.c', 'sched-deps.c', 'sched-ebb.c', 'sched-rgn.c'
     and 'sched-vis.c'.

   * Register allocation

     These passes make sure that all occurrences of pseudo registers are
     eliminated, either by allocating them to a hard register, replacing
     them by an equivalent expression (e.g. a constant) or by placing
     them on the stack.  This is done in several subpasses:

        * The integrated register allocator (IRA).  It is called
          integrated because coalescing, register live range splitting,
          and hard register preferencing are done on-the-fly during
          coloring.  It also has better integration with the reload/LRA
          pass.  Pseudo-registers spilled by the allocator or the
          reload/LRA have still a chance to get hard-registers if the
          reload/LRA evicts some pseudo-registers from hard-registers.
          The allocator helps to choose better pseudos for spilling
          based on their live ranges and to coalesce stack slots
          allocated for the spilled pseudo-registers.  IRA is a regional
          register allocator which is transformed into Chaitin-Briggs
          allocator if there is one region.  By default, IRA chooses
          regions using register pressure but the user can force it to
          use one region or regions corresponding to all loops.

          Source files of the allocator are 'ira.c', 'ira-build.c',
          'ira-costs.c', 'ira-conflicts.c', 'ira-color.c', 'ira-emit.c',
          'ira-lives', plus header files 'ira.h' and 'ira-int.h' used
          for the communication between the allocator and the rest of
          the compiler and between the IRA files.

        * Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the
          hardware registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo
          registers that did not get hard registers are replaced with
          stack slots.  Then it finds instructions that are invalid
          because a value has failed to end up in a register, or has
          ended up in a register of the wrong kind.  It fixes up these
          instructions by reloading the problematical values temporarily
          into registers.  Additional instructions are generated to do
          the copying.

          The reload pass also optionally eliminates the frame pointer
          and inserts instructions to save and restore call-clobbered
          registers around calls.

          Source files are 'reload.c' and 'reload1.c', plus the header
          'reload.h' used for communication between them.

        * This pass is a modern replacement of the reload pass.  Source
          files are 'lra.c', 'lra-assign.c', 'lra-coalesce.c',
          'lra-constraints.c', 'lra-eliminations.c', 'lra-equivs.c',
          'lra-lives.c', 'lra-saves.c', 'lra-spills.c', the header
          'lra-int.h' used for communication between them, and the
          header 'lra.h' used for communication between LRA and the rest
          of compiler.

          Unlike the reload pass, intermediate LRA decisions are
          reflected in RTL as much as possible.  This reduces the number
          of target-dependent macros and hooks, leaving instruction
          constraints as the primary source of control.

          LRA is run on targets for which TARGET_LRA_P returns true.

   * Basic block reordering

     This pass implements profile guided code positioning.  If profile
     information is not available, various types of static analysis are
     performed to make the predictions normally coming from the profile
     feedback (IE execution frequency, branch probability, etc).  It is
     implemented in the file 'bb-reorder.c', and the various prediction
     routines are in 'predict.c'.

   * Variable tracking

     This pass computes where the variables are stored at each position
     in code and generates notes describing the variable locations to
     RTL code.  The location lists are then generated according to these
     notes to debug information if the debugging information format
     supports location lists.  The code is located in 'var-tracking.c'.

   * Delayed branch scheduling

     This optional pass attempts to find instructions that can go into
     the delay slots of other instructions, usually jumps and calls.
     The code for this pass is located in 'reorg.c'.

   * Branch shortening

     On many RISC machines, branch instructions have a limited range.
     Thus, longer sequences of instructions must be used for long
     branches.  In this pass, the compiler figures out what how far each
     instruction will be from each other instruction, and therefore
     whether the usual instructions, or the longer sequences, must be
     used for each branch.  The code for this pass is located in
     'final.c'.

   * Register-to-stack conversion

     Conversion from usage of some hard registers to usage of a register
     stack may be done at this point.  Currently, this is supported only
     for the floating-point registers of the Intel 80387 coprocessor.
     The code for this pass is located in 'reg-stack.c'.

   * Final

     This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  The source
     files are 'final.c' plus 'insn-output.c'; the latter is generated
     automatically from the machine description by the tool 'genoutput'.
     The header file 'conditions.h' is used for communication between
     these files.

   * Debugging information output

     This is run after final because it must output the stack slot
     offsets for pseudo registers that did not get hard registers.
     Source files are 'dbxout.c' for DBX symbol table format, 'sdbout.c'
     for SDB symbol table format, 'dwarfout.c' for DWARF symbol table
     format, files 'dwarf2out.c' and 'dwarf2asm.c' for DWARF2 symbol
     table format, and 'vmsdbgout.c' for VMS debug symbol table format.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Dump setup,  Next: Optimization groups,  Up: Optimization info

9.7.1 Dump setup
----------------

A dump_manager class is defined in 'dumpfile.h'.  Various passes
register dumping pass-specific information via 'dump_register' in
'passes.c'.  During the registration, an optimization pass can select
its optimization group (*note Optimization groups::).  After that
optimization information corresponding to the entire group (presumably
from multiple passes) can be output via command-line switches.  Note
that if a pass does not fit into any of the pre-defined groups, it can
select 'OPTGROUP_NONE'.

 Note that in general, a pass need not know its dump output file name,
whether certain flags are enabled, etc.  However, for legacy reasons,
passes could also call 'dump_begin' which returns a stream in case the
particular pass has optimization dumps enabled.  A pass could call
'dump_end' when the dump has ended.  These methods should go away once
all the passes are converted to use the new dump infrastructure.

 The recommended way to setup the dump output is via 'dump_start' and
'dump_end'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Optimization groups,  Next: Dump files and streams,  Prev: Dump setup,  Up: Optimization info

9.7.2 Optimization groups
-------------------------

The optimization passes are grouped into several categories.  Currently
defined categories in 'dumpfile.h' are

'OPTGROUP_IPA'
     IPA optimization passes.  Enabled by '-ipa'

'OPTGROUP_LOOP'
     Loop optimization passes.  Enabled by '-loop'.

'OPTGROUP_INLINE'
     Inlining passes.  Enabled by '-inline'.

'OPTGROUP_VEC'
     Vectorization passes.  Enabled by '-vec'.

'OPTGROUP_OTHER'
     All other optimization passes which do not fall into one of the
     above.

'OPTGROUP_ALL'
     All optimization passes.  Enabled by '-all'.

 By using groups a user could selectively enable optimization
information only for a group of passes.  By default, the optimization
information for all the passes is dumped.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Dump files and streams,  Next: Dump output verbosity,  Prev: Optimization groups,  Up: Optimization info

9.7.3 Dump files and streams
----------------------------

There are two separate output streams available for outputting
optimization information from passes.  Note that both these streams
accept 'stderr' and 'stdout' as valid streams and thus it is possible to
dump output to standard output or error.  This is specially handy for
outputting all available information in a single file by redirecting
'stderr'.

'pstream'
     This stream is for pass-specific dump output.  For example,
     '-fdump-tree-vect=foo.v' dumps tree vectorization pass output into
     the given file name 'foo.v'.  If the file name is not provided, the
     default file name is based on the source file and pass number.
     Note that one could also use special file names 'stdout' and
     'stderr' for dumping to standard output and standard error
     respectively.

'alt_stream'
     This steam is used for printing optimization specific output in
     response to the '-fopt-info'.  Again a file name can be given.  If
     the file name is not given, it defaults to 'stderr'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Dump output verbosity,  Next: Dump types,  Prev: Dump files and streams,  Up: Optimization info

9.7.4 Dump output verbosity
---------------------------

The dump verbosity has the following options

'optimized'
     Print information when an optimization is successfully applied.  It
     is up to a pass to decide which information is relevant.  For
     example, the vectorizer passes print the source location of loops
     which got successfully vectorized.

'missed'
     Print information about missed optimizations.  Individual passes
     control which information to include in the output.  For example,

          gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed

     will print information about missed optimization opportunities from
     vectorization passes on stderr.

'note'
     Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
     transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.

'all'
     Print detailed optimization information.  This includes OPTIMIZED,
     MISSED, and NOTE.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Dump types,  Next: Dump examples,  Prev: Dump output verbosity,  Up: Optimization info

9.7.5 Dump types
----------------

'dump_printf'

     This is a generic method for doing formatted output.  It takes an
     additional argument 'dump_kind' which signifies the type of dump.
     This method outputs information only when the dumps are enabled for
     this particular 'dump_kind'.  Note that the caller doesn't need to
     know if the particular dump is enabled or not, or even the file
     name.  The caller only needs to decide which dump output
     information is relevant, and under what conditions.  This
     determines the associated flags.

     Consider the following example from 'loop-unroll.c' where an
     informative message about a loop (along with its location) is
     printed when any of the following flags is enabled

        - optimization messages
        - RTL dumps
        - detailed dumps

          int report_flags = MSG_OPTIMIZED_LOCATIONS | TDF_RTL | TDF_DETAILS;
          dump_printf_loc (report_flags, locus,
                           "loop turned into non-loop; it never loops.\n");

'dump_basic_block'
     Output basic block.
'dump_generic_expr'
     Output generic expression.
'dump_gimple_stmt'
     Output gimple statement.

     Note that the above methods also have variants prefixed with
     '_loc', such as 'dump_printf_loc', which are similar except they
     also output the source location information.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Dump examples,  Prev: Dump types,  Up: Optimization info

9.7.6 Dump examples
-------------------

     gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all

 outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
'missed.all'.

 As another example,
     gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt

 will output information about missed optimizations as well as optimized
locations from all the inlining passes into 'inline.txt'.

 If the FILENAME is provided, then the dumps from all the applicable
optimizations are concatenated into the 'filename'.  Otherwise the dump
is output onto 'stderr'.  If OPTIONS is omitted, it defaults to
'all-all', which means dump all available optimization info from all the
passes.  In the following example, all optimization info is output on to
'stderr'.

     gcc -O3 -fopt-info

 Note that '-fopt-info-vec-missed' behaves the same as
'-fopt-info-missed-vec'.

 As another example, consider

     gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt

 Here the two output file names 'vec.miss' and 'loop.opt' are in
conflict since only one output file is allowed.  In this case, only the
first option takes effect and the subsequent options are ignored.  Thus
only the 'vec.miss' is produced which containts dumps from the
vectorizer about missed opportunities.

10 GENERIC
**********

The purpose of GENERIC is simply to provide a language-independent way
of representing an entire function in trees.  To this end, it was
necessary to add a few new tree codes to the back end, but almost
everything was already there.  If you can express it with the codes in
'gcc/tree.def', it's GENERIC.

 Early on, there was a great deal of debate about how to think about
statements in a tree IL.  In GENERIC, a statement is defined as any
expression whose value, if any, is ignored.  A statement will always
have 'TREE_SIDE_EFFECTS' set (or it will be discarded), but a
non-statement expression may also have side effects.  A 'CALL_EXPR', for
instance.

 It would be possible for some local optimizations to work on the
GENERIC form of a function; indeed, the adapted tree inliner works fine
on GENERIC, but the current compiler performs inlining after lowering to
GIMPLE (a restricted form described in the next section).  Indeed,
currently the frontends perform this lowering before handing off to
'tree_rest_of_compilation', but this seems inelegant.

It is, as of yet, only _preliminary_ documentation.

10.2 Overview
=============

The central data structure used by the internal representation is the
'tree'.  These nodes, while all of the C type 'tree', are of many
varieties.  A 'tree' is a pointer type, but the object to which it
points may be of a variety of types.  From this point forward, we will
refer to trees in ordinary type, rather than in 'this font', except when
talking about the actual C type 'tree'.

 You can tell what kind of node a particular tree is by using the
'TREE_CODE' macro.  Many, many macros take trees as input and return
trees as output.  However, most macros require a certain kind of tree
node as input.  In other words, there is a type-system for trees, but it
is not reflected in the C type-system.

 For safety, it is useful to configure GCC with '--enable-checking'.
Although this results in a significant performance penalty (since all
tree types are checked at run-time), and is therefore inappropriate in a
release version, it is extremely helpful during the development process.

 Many macros behave as predicates.  Many, although not all, of these
predicates end in '_P'.  Do not rely on the result type of these macros
being of any particular type.  You may, however, rely on the fact that
the type can be compared to '0', so that statements like
     if (TEST_P (t) && !TEST_P (y))
       x = 1;
and
     int i = (TEST_P (t) != 0);
are legal.  Macros that return 'int' values now may be changed to return
'tree' values, or other pointers in the future.  Even those that
continue to return 'int' may return multiple nonzero codes where
previously they returned only zero and one.  Therefore, you should not
write code like
     if (TEST_P (t) == 1)
as this code is not guaranteed to work correctly in the future.

 You should not take the address of values returned by the macros or
functions described here.  In particular, no guarantee is given that the
values are lvalues.

 In general, the names of macros are all in uppercase, while the names
of functions are entirely in lowercase.  There are rare exceptions to
this rule.  You should assume that any macro or function whose name is
made up entirely of uppercase letters may evaluate its arguments more
than once.  You may assume that a macro or function whose name is made
up entirely of lowercase letters will evaluate its arguments only once.

 The 'error_mark_node' is a special tree.  Its tree code is
'ERROR_MARK', but since there is only ever one node with that code, the
usual practice is to compare the tree against 'error_mark_node'.  (This
test is just a test for pointer equality.)  If an error has occurred
during front-end processing the flag 'errorcount' will be set.  If the
front end has encountered code it cannot handle, it will issue a message
to the user and set 'sorrycount'.  When these flags are set, any macro
or function which normally returns a tree of a particular kind may
instead return the 'error_mark_node'.  Thus, if you intend to do any
processing of erroneous code, you must be prepared to deal with the
'error_mark_node'.

 Occasionally, a particular tree slot (like an operand to an expression,
or a particular field in a declaration) will be referred to as "reserved
for the back end".  These slots are used to store RTL when the tree is
converted to RTL for use by the GCC back end.  However, if that process
is not taking place (e.g., if the front end is being hooked up to an
intelligent editor), then those slots may be used by the back end
presently in use.

 If you encounter situations that do not match this documentation, such
as tree nodes of types not mentioned here, or macros documented to
return entities of a particular kind that instead return entities of
some different kind, you have found a bug, either in the front end or in
the documentation.  Please report these bugs as you would any other bug.

10.2.1 Trees
------------

All GENERIC trees have two fields in common.  First, 'TREE_CHAIN' is a
pointer that can be used as a singly-linked list to other trees.  The
other is 'TREE_TYPE'.  Many trees store the type of an expression or
declaration in this field.

 These are some other functions for handling trees:

'tree_size'
     Return the number of bytes a tree takes.

'build0'
'build1'
'build2'
'build3'
'build4'
'build5'
'build6'

     These functions build a tree and supply values to put in each
     parameter.  The basic signature is 'code, type, [operands]'.
     'code' is the 'TREE_CODE', and 'type' is a tree representing the
     'TREE_TYPE'.  These are followed by the operands, each of which is
     also a tree.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Identifiers,  Next: Containers,  Prev: Macros and Functions,  Up: Tree overview

10.2.2 Identifiers
------------------

An 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' represents a slightly more general concept than the
standard C or C++ concept of identifier.  In particular, an
'IDENTIFIER_NODE' may contain a '$', or other extraordinary characters.

 There are never two distinct 'IDENTIFIER_NODE's representing the same
identifier.  Therefore, you may use pointer equality to compare
'IDENTIFIER_NODE's, rather than using a routine like 'strcmp'.  Use
'get_identifier' to obtain the unique 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' for a supplied
string.

 You can use the following macros to access identifiers:
'IDENTIFIER_POINTER'
     The string represented by the identifier, represented as a 'char*'.
     This string is always 'NUL'-terminated, and contains no embedded
     'NUL' characters.

'IDENTIFIER_LENGTH'
     The length of the string returned by 'IDENTIFIER_POINTER', not
     including the trailing 'NUL'.  This value of 'IDENTIFIER_LENGTH
     (x)' is always the same as 'strlen (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (x))'.

'IDENTIFIER_OPNAME_P'
     This predicate holds if the identifier represents the name of an
     overloaded operator.  In this case, you should not depend on the
     contents of either the 'IDENTIFIER_POINTER' or the
     'IDENTIFIER_LENGTH'.

'IDENTIFIER_TYPENAME_P'
     This predicate holds if the identifier represents the name of a
     user-defined conversion operator.  In this case, the 'TREE_TYPE' of
     the 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' holds the type to which the conversion
     operator converts.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Containers,  Prev: Identifiers,  Up: Tree overview

10.2.3 Containers
-----------------

Two common container data structures can be represented directly with
tree nodes.  A 'TREE_LIST' is a singly linked list containing two trees
per node.  These are the 'TREE_PURPOSE' and 'TREE_VALUE' of each node.
(Often, the 'TREE_PURPOSE' contains some kind of tag, or additional
information, while the 'TREE_VALUE' contains the majority of the
payload.  In other cases, the 'TREE_PURPOSE' is simply 'NULL_TREE',
while in still others both the 'TREE_PURPOSE' and 'TREE_VALUE' are of
equal stature.)  Given one 'TREE_LIST' node, the next node is found by
following the 'TREE_CHAIN'.  If the 'TREE_CHAIN' is 'NULL_TREE', then
you have reached the end of the list.

 A 'TREE_VEC' is a simple vector.  The 'TREE_VEC_LENGTH' is an integer
(not a tree) giving the number of nodes in the vector.  The nodes
themselves are accessed using the 'TREE_VEC_ELT' macro, which takes two
arguments.  The first is the 'TREE_VEC' in question; the second is an
integer indicating which element in the vector is desired.  The elements
are indexed from zero.

10.3 Types
==========

All types have corresponding tree nodes.  However, you should not assume
that there is exactly one tree node corresponding to each type.  There
are often multiple nodes corresponding to the same type.

 For the most part, different kinds of types have different tree codes.
(For example, pointer types use a 'POINTER_TYPE' code while arrays use
an 'ARRAY_TYPE' code.)  However, pointers to member functions use the
'RECORD_TYPE' code.  Therefore, when writing a 'switch' statement that
depends on the code associated with a particular type, you should take
care to handle pointers to member functions under the 'RECORD_TYPE' case
label.

 The following functions and macros deal with cv-qualification of types:
'TYPE_MAIN_VARIANT'
     This macro returns the unqualified version of a type.  It may be
     applied to an unqualified type, but it is not always the identity
     function in that case.

 A few other macros and functions are usable with all types:
'TYPE_SIZE'
     The number of bits required to represent the type, represented as
     an 'INTEGER_CST'.  For an incomplete type, 'TYPE_SIZE' will be
     'NULL_TREE'.

'TYPE_ALIGN'
     The alignment of the type, in bits, represented as an 'int'.

'TYPE_NAME'
     This macro returns a declaration (in the form of a 'TYPE_DECL') for
     the type.  (Note this macro does _not_ return an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE',
     as you might expect, given its name!)  You can look at the
     'DECL_NAME' of the 'TYPE_DECL' to obtain the actual name of the
     type.  The 'TYPE_NAME' will be 'NULL_TREE' for a type that is not a
     built-in type, the result of a typedef, or a named class type.

'TYPE_CANONICAL'
     This macro returns the "canonical" type for the given type node.
     Canonical types are used to improve performance in the C++ and
     Objective-C++ front ends by allowing efficient comparison between
     two type nodes in 'same_type_p': if the 'TYPE_CANONICAL' values of
     the types are equal, the types are equivalent; otherwise, the types
     are not equivalent.  The notion of equivalence for canonical types
     is the same as the notion of type equivalence in the language
     itself.  For instance,

     When 'TYPE_CANONICAL' is 'NULL_TREE', there is no canonical type
     for the given type node.  In this case, comparison between this
     type and any other type requires the compiler to perform a deep,
     "structural" comparison to see if the two type nodes have the same
     form and properties.

     The canonical type for a node is always the most fundamental type
     in the equivalence class of types.  For instance, 'int' is its own
     canonical type.  A typedef 'I' of 'int' will have 'int' as its
     canonical type.  Similarly, 'I*' and a typedef 'IP' (defined to
     'I*') will has 'int*' as their canonical type.  When building a new
     type node, be sure to set 'TYPE_CANONICAL' to the appropriate
     canonical type.  If the new type is a compound type (built from
     other types), and any of those other types require structural
     equality, use 'SET_TYPE_STRUCTURAL_EQUALITY' to ensure that the new
     type also requires structural equality.  Finally, if for some
     reason you cannot guarantee that 'TYPE_CANONICAL' will point to the
     canonical type, use 'SET_TYPE_STRUCTURAL_EQUALITY' to make sure
     that the new type-and any type constructed based on it-requires
     structural equality.  If you suspect that the canonical type system
     is miscomparing types, pass '--param verify-canonical-types=1' to
     the compiler or configure with '--enable-checking' to force the
     compiler to verify its canonical-type comparisons against the
     structural comparisons; the compiler will then print any warnings
     if the canonical types miscompare.

'TYPE_STRUCTURAL_EQUALITY_P'
     This predicate holds when the node requires structural equality
     checks, e.g., when 'TYPE_CANONICAL' is 'NULL_TREE'.

'SET_TYPE_STRUCTURAL_EQUALITY'
     This macro states that the type node it is given requires
     structural equality checks, e.g., it sets 'TYPE_CANONICAL' to
     'NULL_TREE'.

'same_type_p'
     This predicate takes two types as input, and holds if they are the
     same type.  For example, if one type is a 'typedef' for the other,
     or both are 'typedef's for the same type.  This predicate also
     holds if the two trees given as input are simply copies of one
     another; i.e., there is no difference between them at the source
     level, but, for whatever reason, a duplicate has been made in the
     representation.  You should never use '==' (pointer equality) to
     compare types; always use 'same_type_p' instead.

 Detailed below are the various kinds of types, and the macros that can
be used to access them.  Although other kinds of types are used
elsewhere in G++, the types described here are the only ones that you
will encounter while examining the intermediate representation.

'VOID_TYPE'
     Used to represent the 'void' type.

'INTEGER_TYPE'
     Used to represent the various integral types, including 'char',
     'short', 'int', 'long', and 'long long'.  This code is not used for
     enumeration types, nor for the 'bool' type.  The 'TYPE_PRECISION'
     is the number of bits used in the representation, represented as an
     'unsigned int'.  (Note that in the general case this is not the
     same value as 'TYPE_SIZE'; suppose that there were a 24-bit integer
     type, but that alignment requirements for the ABI required 32-bit
     alignment.  Then, 'TYPE_SIZE' would be an 'INTEGER_CST' for 32,
     while 'TYPE_PRECISION' would be 24.)  The integer type is unsigned
     if 'TYPE_UNSIGNED' holds; otherwise, it is signed.

     The 'TYPE_MIN_VALUE' is an 'INTEGER_CST' for the smallest integer
     that may be represented by this type.  Similarly, the
     'TYPE_MAX_VALUE' is an 'INTEGER_CST' for the largest integer that
     may be represented by this type.

'REAL_TYPE'
     Used to represent the 'float', 'double', and 'long double' types.
     The number of bits in the floating-point representation is given by
     'TYPE_PRECISION', as in the 'INTEGER_TYPE' case.

'FIXED_POINT_TYPE'
     Used to represent the 'short _Fract', '_Fract', 'long _Fract',
     'long long _Fract', 'short _Accum', '_Accum', 'long _Accum', and
     'long long _Accum' types.  The number of bits in the fixed-point
     representation is given by 'TYPE_PRECISION', as in the
     'INTEGER_TYPE' case.  There may be padding bits, fractional bits
     and integral bits.  The number of fractional bits is given by
     'TYPE_FBIT', and the number of integral bits is given by
     'TYPE_IBIT'.  The fixed-point type is unsigned if 'TYPE_UNSIGNED'
     holds; otherwise, it is signed.  The fixed-point type is saturating
     if 'TYPE_SATURATING' holds; otherwise, it is not saturating.

'COMPLEX_TYPE'
     Used to represent GCC built-in '__complex__' data types.  The
     'TREE_TYPE' is the type of the real and imaginary parts.

'ENUMERAL_TYPE'
     Used to represent an enumeration type.  The 'TYPE_PRECISION' gives
     (as an 'int'), the number of bits used to represent the type.  If
     there are no negative enumeration constants, 'TYPE_UNSIGNED' will
     hold.  The minimum and maximum enumeration constants may be
     obtained with 'TYPE_MIN_VALUE' and 'TYPE_MAX_VALUE', respectively;
     each of these macros returns an 'INTEGER_CST'.

     The actual enumeration constants themselves may be obtained by
     looking at the 'TYPE_VALUES'.  This macro will return a
     'TREE_LIST', containing the constants.  The 'TREE_PURPOSE' of each
     node will be an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' giving the name of the constant;
     the 'TREE_VALUE' will be an 'INTEGER_CST' giving the value assigned
     to that constant.  These constants will appear in the order in
     which they were declared.  The 'TREE_TYPE' of each of these
     constants will be the type of enumeration type itself.

'BOOLEAN_TYPE'
     Used to represent the 'bool' type.

'POINTER_TYPE'
     Used to represent pointer types, and pointer to data member types.
     The 'TREE_TYPE' gives the type to which this type points.

'REFERENCE_TYPE'
     Used to represent reference types.  The 'TREE_TYPE' gives the type
     to which this type refers.

'FUNCTION_TYPE'
     Used to represent the type of non-member functions and of static
     member functions.  The 'TREE_TYPE' gives the return type of the
     function.  The 'TYPE_ARG_TYPES' are a 'TREE_LIST' of the argument
     types.  The 'TREE_VALUE' of each node in this list is the type of
     the corresponding argument; the 'TREE_PURPOSE' is an expression for
     the default argument value, if any.  If the last node in the list
     is 'void_list_node' (a 'TREE_LIST' node whose 'TREE_VALUE' is the
     'void_type_node'), then functions of this type do not take variable
     arguments.  Otherwise, they do take a variable number of arguments.

     Note that in C (but not in C++) a function declared like 'void f()'
     is an unprototyped function taking a variable number of arguments;
     the 'TYPE_ARG_TYPES' of such a function will be 'NULL'.

'METHOD_TYPE'
     Used to represent the type of a non-static member function.  Like a
     'FUNCTION_TYPE', the return type is given by the 'TREE_TYPE'.  The
     type of '*this', i.e., the class of which functions of this type
     are a member, is given by the 'TYPE_METHOD_BASETYPE'.  The
     'TYPE_ARG_TYPES' is the parameter list, as for a 'FUNCTION_TYPE',
     and includes the 'this' argument.

'ARRAY_TYPE'
     Used to represent array types.  The 'TREE_TYPE' gives the type of
     the elements in the array.  If the array-bound is present in the
     type, the 'TYPE_DOMAIN' is an 'INTEGER_TYPE' whose 'TYPE_MIN_VALUE'
     and 'TYPE_MAX_VALUE' will be the lower and upper bounds of the
     array, respectively.  The 'TYPE_MIN_VALUE' will always be an
     'INTEGER_CST' for zero, while the 'TYPE_MAX_VALUE' will be one less
     than the number of elements in the array, i.e., the highest value
     which may be used to index an element in the array.

'RECORD_TYPE'
     Used to represent 'struct' and 'class' types, as well as pointers
     to member functions and similar constructs in other languages.
     'TYPE_FIELDS' contains the items contained in this type, each of
     which can be a 'FIELD_DECL', 'VAR_DECL', 'CONST_DECL', or
     'TYPE_DECL'.  You may not make any assumptions about the ordering
     of the fields in the type or whether one or more of them overlap.

'UNION_TYPE'
     Used to represent 'union' types.  Similar to 'RECORD_TYPE' except
     that all 'FIELD_DECL' nodes in 'TYPE_FIELD' start at bit position
     zero.

'QUAL_UNION_TYPE'
     Used to represent part of a variant record in Ada.  Similar to
     'UNION_TYPE' except that each 'FIELD_DECL' has a 'DECL_QUALIFIER'
     field, which contains a boolean expression that indicates whether
     the field is present in the object.  The type will only have one
     field, so each field's 'DECL_QUALIFIER' is only evaluated if none
     of the expressions in the previous fields in 'TYPE_FIELDS' are
     nonzero.  Normally these expressions will reference a field in the
     outer object using a 'PLACEHOLDER_EXPR'.

'LANG_TYPE'
     This node is used to represent a language-specific type.  The front
     end must handle it.

'OFFSET_TYPE'
     This node is used to represent a pointer-to-data member.  For a
     data member 'X::m' the 'TYPE_OFFSET_BASETYPE' is 'X' and the
     'TREE_TYPE' is the type of 'm'.

 There are variables whose values represent some of the basic types.
These include:
'void_type_node'
     A node for 'void'.

'integer_type_node'
     A node for 'int'.

'unsigned_type_node.'
     A node for 'unsigned int'.

'char_type_node.'
     A node for 'char'.
It may sometimes be useful to compare one of these variables with a type
in hand, using 'same_type_p'.

10.4 Declarations
=================

This section covers the various kinds of declarations that appear in the
internal representation, except for declarations of functions
(represented by 'FUNCTION_DECL' nodes), which are described in *note
Functions::.

* Menu:

* Working with declarations::  Macros and functions that work on
declarations.
* Internal structure:: How declaration nodes are represented.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Working with declarations,  Next: Internal structure,  Up: Declarations

10.4.1 Working with declarations
--------------------------------

Some macros can be used with any kind of declaration.  These include:
'DECL_NAME'
     This macro returns an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE' giving the name of the
     entity.

'TREE_TYPE'
     This macro returns the type of the entity declared.

'EXPR_FILENAME'
     This macro returns the name of the file in which the entity was
     declared, as a 'char*'.  For an entity declared implicitly by the
     compiler (like '__builtin_memcpy'), this will be the string
     '"<internal>"'.

'EXPR_LINENO'
     This macro returns the line number at which the entity was
     declared, as an 'int'.

'DECL_ARTIFICIAL'
     This predicate holds if the declaration was implicitly generated by
     the compiler.  For example, this predicate will hold of an
     implicitly declared member function, or of the 'TYPE_DECL'
     implicitly generated for a class type.  Recall that in C++ code
     like:
          struct S {};
     is roughly equivalent to C code like:
          struct S {};
          typedef struct S S;
     The implicitly generated 'typedef' declaration is represented by a
     'TYPE_DECL' for which 'DECL_ARTIFICIAL' holds.

 The various kinds of declarations include:
'LABEL_DECL'
     These nodes are used to represent labels in function bodies.  For
     more information, see *note Functions::.  These nodes only appear
     in block scopes.

'CONST_DECL'
     These nodes are used to represent enumeration constants.  The value
     of the constant is given by 'DECL_INITIAL' which will be an
     'INTEGER_CST' with the same type as the 'TREE_TYPE' of the
     'CONST_DECL', i.e., an 'ENUMERAL_TYPE'.

'RESULT_DECL'
     These nodes represent the value returned by a function.  When a
     value is assigned to a 'RESULT_DECL', that indicates that the value
     should be returned, via bitwise copy, by the function.  You can use
     'DECL_SIZE' and 'DECL_ALIGN' on a 'RESULT_DECL', just as with a
     'VAR_DECL'.

'TYPE_DECL'
     These nodes represent 'typedef' declarations.  The 'TREE_TYPE' is
     the type declared to have the name given by 'DECL_NAME'.  In some
     cases, there is no associated name.

'VAR_DECL'
     These nodes represent variables with namespace or block scope, as
     well as static data members.  The 'DECL_SIZE' and 'DECL_ALIGN' are
     analogous to 'TYPE_SIZE' and 'TYPE_ALIGN'.  For a declaration, you
     should always use the 'DECL_SIZE' and 'DECL_ALIGN' rather than the
     'TYPE_SIZE' and 'TYPE_ALIGN' given by the 'TREE_TYPE', since
     special attributes may have been applied to the variable to give it
     a particular size and alignment.  You may use the predicates
     'DECL_THIS_STATIC' or 'DECL_THIS_EXTERN' to test whether the
     storage class specifiers 'static' or 'extern' were used to declare
     a variable.

     If this variable is initialized (but does not require a
     constructor), the 'DECL_INITIAL' will be an expression for the
     initializer.  The initializer should be evaluated, and a bitwise
     copy into the variable performed.  If the 'DECL_INITIAL' is the
     'error_mark_node', there is an initializer, but it is given by an
     explicit statement later in the code; no bitwise copy is required.

     GCC provides an extension that allows either automatic variables,
     or global variables, to be placed in particular registers.  This
     extension is being used for a particular 'VAR_DECL' if
     'DECL_REGISTER' holds for the 'VAR_DECL', and if
     'DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' is not equal to 'DECL_NAME'.  In that case,
     'DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' is the name of the register into which the
     variable will be placed.

'PARM_DECL'
     Used to represent a parameter to a function.  Treat these nodes
     similarly to 'VAR_DECL' nodes.  These nodes only appear in the
     'DECL_ARGUMENTS' for a 'FUNCTION_DECL'.

     The 'DECL_ARG_TYPE' for a 'PARM_DECL' is the type that will
     actually be used when a value is passed to this function.  It may
     be a wider type than the 'TREE_TYPE' of the parameter; for example,
     the ordinary type might be 'short' while the 'DECL_ARG_TYPE' is
     'int'.

'DEBUG_EXPR_DECL'
     Used to represent an anonymous debug-information temporary created
     to hold an expression as it is optimized away, so that its value
     can be referenced in debug bind statements.

'FIELD_DECL'
     These nodes represent non-static data members.  The 'DECL_SIZE' and
     'DECL_ALIGN' behave as for 'VAR_DECL' nodes.  The position of the
     field within the parent record is specified by a combination of
     three attributes.  'DECL_FIELD_OFFSET' is the position, counting in
     bytes, of the 'DECL_OFFSET_ALIGN'-bit sized word containing the bit
     of the field closest to the beginning of the structure.
     'DECL_FIELD_BIT_OFFSET' is the bit offset of the first bit of the
     field within this word; this may be nonzero even for fields that
     are not bit-fields, since 'DECL_OFFSET_ALIGN' may be greater than
     the natural alignment of the field's type.

     If 'DECL_C_BIT_FIELD' holds, this field is a bit-field.  In a
     bit-field, 'DECL_BIT_FIELD_TYPE' also contains the type that was
     originally specified for it, while DECL_TYPE may be a modified type
     with lesser precision, according to the size of the bit field.

'NAMESPACE_DECL'
     Namespaces provide a name hierarchy for other declarations.  They
     appear in the 'DECL_CONTEXT' of other '_DECL' nodes.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Current structure hierarchy,  Next: Adding new DECL node types,  Up: Internal structure

10.4.2.1 Current structure hierarchy
....................................

'struct tree_decl_minimal'
     This is the minimal structure to inherit from in order for common
     'DECL' macros to work.  The fields it contains are a unique ID,
     source location, context, and name.

'struct tree_decl_common'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_minimal'.  It
     contains fields that most 'DECL' nodes need, such as a field to
     store alignment, machine mode, size, and attributes.

'struct tree_field_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_common'.  It is used
     to represent 'FIELD_DECL'.

'struct tree_label_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_common'.  It is used
     to represent 'LABEL_DECL'.

'struct tree_translation_unit_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_common'.  It is used
     to represent 'TRANSLATION_UNIT_DECL'.

'struct tree_decl_with_rtl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_common'.  It
     contains a field to store the low-level RTL associated with a
     'DECL' node.

'struct tree_result_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_with_rtl'.  It is
     used to represent 'RESULT_DECL'.

'struct tree_const_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_with_rtl'.  It is
     used to represent 'CONST_DECL'.

'struct tree_parm_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_with_rtl'.  It is
     used to represent 'PARM_DECL'.

'struct tree_decl_with_vis'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_with_rtl'.  It
     contains fields necessary to store visibility information, as well
     as a section name and assembler name.

'struct tree_var_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_with_vis'.  It is
     used to represent 'VAR_DECL'.

'struct tree_function_decl'
     This structure inherits from 'struct tree_decl_with_vis'.  It is
     used to represent 'FUNCTION_DECL'.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Adding new DECL node types,  Prev: Current structure hierarchy,  Up: Internal structure

10.4.2.2 Adding new DECL node types
...................................

Adding a new 'DECL' tree consists of the following steps

Add a new tree code for the 'DECL' node
     For language specific 'DECL' nodes, there is a '.def' file in each
     frontend directory where the tree code should be added.  For 'DECL'
     nodes that are part of the middle-end, the code should be added to
     'tree.def'.

Create a new structure type for the 'DECL' node
     These structures should inherit from one of the existing structures
     in the language hierarchy by using that structure as the first
     member.

          struct tree_foo_decl
          {
             struct tree_decl_with_vis common;
          }

     Would create a structure name 'tree_foo_decl' that inherits from
     'struct tree_decl_with_vis'.

     For language specific 'DECL' nodes, this new structure type should
     go in the appropriate '.h' file.  For 'DECL' nodes that are part of
     the middle-end, the structure type should go in 'tree.h'.

Add a member to the tree structure enumerator for the node
     For garbage collection and dynamic checking purposes, each 'DECL'
     node structure type is required to have a unique enumerator value
     specified with it.  For language specific 'DECL' nodes, this new
     enumerator value should go in the appropriate '.def' file.  For
     'DECL' nodes that are part of the middle-end, the enumerator values
     are specified in 'treestruct.def'.

Update 'union tree_node'
     In order to make your new structure type usable, it must be added
     to 'union tree_node'.  For language specific 'DECL' nodes, a new
     entry should be added to the appropriate '.h' file of the form
            struct tree_foo_decl GTY ((tag ("TS_VAR_DECL"))) foo_decl;
     For 'DECL' nodes that are part of the middle-end, the additional
     member goes directly into 'union tree_node' in 'tree.h'.

Update dynamic checking info
     In order to be able to check whether accessing a named portion of
     'union tree_node' is legal, and whether a certain 'DECL' node
     contains one of the enumerated 'DECL' node structures in the
     hierarchy, a simple lookup table is used.  This lookup table needs
     to be kept up to date with the tree structure hierarchy, or else
     checking and containment macros will fail inappropriately.

     For language specific 'DECL' nodes, their is an 'init_ts' function
     in an appropriate '.c' file, which initializes the lookup table.
     Code setting up the table for new 'DECL' nodes should be added
     there.  For each 'DECL' tree code and enumerator value representing
     a member of the inheritance hierarchy, the table should contain 1
     if that tree code inherits (directly or indirectly) from that
     member.  Thus, a 'FOO_DECL' node derived from 'struct
     decl_with_rtl', and enumerator value 'TS_FOO_DECL', would be set up
     as follows
          tree_contains_struct[FOO_DECL][TS_FOO_DECL] = 1;
          tree_contains_struct[FOO_DECL][TS_DECL_WRTL] = 1;
          tree_contains_struct[FOO_DECL][TS_DECL_COMMON] = 1;
          tree_contains_struct[FOO_DECL][TS_DECL_MINIMAL] = 1;

     For 'DECL' nodes that are part of the middle-end, the setup code
     goes into 'tree.c'.

Add macros to access any new fields and flags

     Each added field or flag should have a macro that is used to access
     it, that performs appropriate checking to ensure only the right
     type of 'DECL' nodes access the field.

     These macros generally take the following form
          #define FOO_DECL_FIELDNAME(NODE) FOO_DECL_CHECK(NODE)->foo_decl.fieldname
     However, if the structure is simply a base class for further
     structures, something like the following should be used
          #define BASE_STRUCT_CHECK(T) CONTAINS_STRUCT_CHECK(T, TS_BASE_STRUCT)
          #define BASE_STRUCT_FIELDNAME(NODE) \
             (BASE_STRUCT_CHECK(NODE)->base_struct.fieldname

     Reading them from the generated 'all-tree.def' file (which in turn
     includes all the 'tree.def' files), 'gencheck.c' is used during
     GCC's build to generate the '*_CHECK' macros for all tree codes.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Attributes,  Next: Expression trees,  Prev: Declarations,  Up: GENERIC

10.5 Attributes in trees
========================

Attributes, as specified using the '__attribute__' keyword, are
represented internally as a 'TREE_LIST'.  The 'TREE_PURPOSE' is the name
of the attribute, as an 'IDENTIFIER_NODE'.  The 'TREE_VALUE' is a
'TREE_LIST' of the arguments of the attribute, if any, or 'NULL_TREE' if
there are no arguments; the arguments are stored as the 'TREE_VALUE' of
successive entries in the list, and may be identifiers or expressions.
The 'TREE_CHAIN' of the attribute is the next attribute in a list of
attributes applying to the same declaration or type, or 'NULL_TREE' if
there are no further attributes in the list.

 Attributes may be attached to declarations and to types; these
attributes may be accessed with the following macros.  All attributes
are stored in this way, and many also cause other changes to the
declaration or type or to other internal compiler data structures.

 -- Tree Macro: tree DECL_ATTRIBUTES (tree DECL)
     This macro returns the attributes on the declaration DECL.

 -- Tree Macro: tree TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (tree TYPE)
     This macro returns the attributes on the type TYPE.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Expression trees,  Next: Statements,  Prev: Attributes,  Up: GENERIC

10.6 Expressions
================

The internal representation for expressions is for the most part quite
straightforward.  However, there are a few facts that one must bear in
mind.  In particular, the expression "tree" is actually a directed
acyclic graph.  (For example there may be many references to the integer
constant zero throughout the source program; many of these will be
represented by the same expression node.)  You should not rely on
certain kinds of node being shared, nor should you rely on certain kinds
of nodes being unshared.

 The following macros can be used with all expression nodes:

'TREE_TYPE'
     Returns the type of the expression.  This value may not be
     precisely the same type that would be given the expression in the
     original program.

 In what follows, some nodes that one might expect to always have type
'bool' are documented to have either integral or boolean type.  At some
point in the future, the C front end may also make use of this same
intermediate representation, and at this point these nodes will
certainly have integral type.  The previous sentence is not meant to
imply that the C++ front end does not or will not give these nodes
integral type.

 Below, we list the various kinds of expression nodes.  Except where
noted otherwise, the operands to an expression are accessed using the
'TREE_OPERAND' macro.  For example, to access the first operand to a
binary plus expression 'expr', use:

     TREE_OPERAND (expr, 0)

 As this example indicates, the operands are zero-indexed.

File: gccint.info,  Node: Constant expressions,  Next: Storage References,  Up: Expression trees

10.6.1 Constant expressions
---------------------------

The table below begins with constants, moves on to unary expressions,
then proceeds to binary expressions, and concludes with various other
kinds of expressions:

'INTEGER_CST'
     These nodes represent integer constants.  Note that the type of
     these constants is obtained with 'TREE_TYPE'; they are not always
     of type 'int'.  In particular, 'char' constants are represented
     with 'INTEGER_CST' nodes.  The value of the integer constant 'e' is
     given by
          ((TREE_INT_CST_HIGH (e) << HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT)
          + TREE_INST_CST_LOW (e))
     HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT is at least thirty-two on all platforms.
     Both 'TREE_INT_CST_HIGH' and 'TREE_INT_CST_LOW' return a
     'HOST_WIDE_INT'.  The value of an 'INTEGER_CST' is interpreted as a
     signed or unsigned quantity depending on the type of the constant.
     In general, the expression given above will overflow, so it should
     not be used to calculate the value of the constant.

     The variable 'integer_zero_node' is an integer constant with value
     zero.  Similarly, 'integer_one_node' is an integer constant with
     value one.  The 'size_zero_node' and 'size_one_node' variables are
     analogous, but have type 'size_t' rather than 'int'.

     The function 'tree_int_cst_lt' is a predicate which holds if its
     first argument is less than its second.  Both constants are assumed
     to have the same signedness (i.e., either both should be signed or
     both should be unsigned.)  The full width of the constant is used
     when doing the comparison; the usual rules about promotions and
     conversions are ignored.  Similarly, 'tree_int_cst_equal' holds if
     the two constants are equal.  The 'tree_int_cst_sgn' function
     returns the sign of a constant.  The value is '1', '0', or '-1'
     according on whether the constant is greater than, equal to, or
     less than zero.  Again, the signedness of the constant's type is
     taken into account; an unsigned constant is never less than zero,
     no matter what its bit-pattern.

'REAL_CST'

     FIXME: Talk about how to obtain representations of this constant,
     do comparisons, and so forth.

'FIXED_CST'

     These nodes represent fixed-point constants.  The type of these
     constants is obtained with 'TREE_TYPE'.  'TREE_FIXED_CST_PTR'
     points to a 'struct fixed_value'; 'TREE_FIXED_CST' returns the
     structure itself.  'struct fixed_value' contains 'data' with the
     size of two 'HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT' and 'mode' as the associated
     fixed-point machine mode for 'data'.

'COMPLEX_CST'
     These nodes are used to represent complex number constants, that is
     a '__complex__' whose parts are constant nodes.  The
     'TREE_REALPART' and 'TREE_IMAGPART' return the real and the
     imaginary parts respectively.

'VECTOR_CST'
     These nodes are used to represent vector constants, whose parts are
     constant nodes.  Each individual constant node is either an integer
     or a double constant node.  The first operand is a 'TREE_LIST' of
     the constant nodes and is accessed through 'TREE_VECTOR_CST_ELTS'.

'STRING_CST'
     These nodes represent string-constants.  The 'TREE_STRING_LENGTH'
     returns the length of the string, as an 'int'.  The
     'TREE_STRING_POINTER' is a 'char*' containing the string itself.
     The string may not be 'NUL'-terminated, and it may contain embedded
     'NUL' characters.  Therefore, the 'TREE_STRING_LENGTH' includes the
     trailing 'NUL' if it is present.

     For wide string constants, the 'TREE_STRING_LENGTH' is the number
     of bytes in the string, and the 'TREE_STRING_POINTER' points to an
     array of the bytes of the string, as represented on the target
     system (that is, as integers in the target endianness).  Wide and
     non-wide string constants are distinguished only by the 'TREE_TYPE'
     of the 'STRING_CST'.

     FIXME: The formats of string constants are not well-defined when
     the target system bytes are not the same width as host system
     bytes.

10.6.2 References to storage
----------------------------

'ARRAY_REF'
     These nodes represent array accesses.  The first operand is the
     array; the second is the index.  To calculate the address of the
     memory accessed, you must scale the index by the size of the type
     of the array elements.  The type of these expressions must be the
     type of a component of the array.  The third and fourth operands
     are used after gimplification to represent the lower bound and
     component size but should not be used directly; call
     'array_ref_low_bound' and 'array_ref_element_size' instead.

'ARRAY_RANGE_REF'
     These nodes represent access to a range (or "slice") of an array.
     The operands are the same as that for 'ARRAY_REF' and have the same
     meanings.  The type of these expressions must be an array whose
     component type is the same as that of the first operand.  The range
     of that array type determines the amount of data these expressions
     access.

'TARGET_MEM_REF'
     These nodes represent memory accesses whose address directly map to
     an addressing mode of the target architecture.  The first argument
     is 'TMR_SYMBOL' and must be a 'VAR_DECL' of an object with a fixed
     address.  The second argument is 'TMR_BASE' and the third one is
     'TMR_INDEX'.  The fourth argument is 'TMR_STEP' and must be an
     'INTEGER_CST'.  The fifth argument is 'TMR_OFFSET' and must be an
     'INTEGER_CST'.  Any of the arguments may be NULL if the appropriate
     component does not appear in the address.  Address of the
     'TARGET_MEM_REF' is determined in the following way.

          &TMR_SYMBOL + TMR_BASE + TMR_INDEX * TMR_STEP + TMR_OFFSET

     The sixth argument is the reference to the original memory access,
     which is preserved for the purposes of the RTL alias analysis.  The
     seventh argument is a tag representing the results of tree level
     alias analysis.

'ADDR_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent the address of an object.  (These
     expressions will always have pointer or reference type.)  The
     operand may be another expression, or it may be a declaration.

     As an extension, GCC allows users to take the address of a label.
     In this case, the operand of the 'ADDR_EXPR' will be a
     'LABEL_DECL'.  The type of such an expression is 'void*'.

     If the object addressed is not an lvalue, a temporary is created,
     and the address of the temporary is used.

'INDIRECT_REF'
     These nodes are used to represent the object pointed to by a
     pointer.  The operand is the pointer being dereferenced; it will
     always have pointer or reference type.

'MEM_REF'
     These nodes are used to represent the object pointed to by a
     pointer offset by a constant.  The first operand is the pointer
     being dereferenced; it will always have pointer or reference type.
     The second operand is a pointer constant.  Its type is specifying
     the type to be used for type-based alias analysis.

'COMPONENT_REF'
     These nodes represent non-static data member accesses.  The first
     operand is the object (rather than a pointer to it); the second
     operand is the 'FIELD_DECL' for the data member.  The third operand
     represents the byte offset of the field, but should not be used
     directly; call 'component_ref_field_offset' instead.


File: gccint.info,  Node: Unary and Binary Expressions,  Next: Vectors,  Prev: Storage References,  Up: Expression trees

10.6.3 Unary and Binary Expressions
-----------------------------------

'NEGATE_EXPR'
     These nodes represent unary negation of the single operand, for
     both integer and floating-point types.  The type of negation can be
     determined by looking at the type of the expression.

     The behavior of this operation on signed arithmetic overflow is
     controlled by the 'flag_wrapv' and 'flag_trapv' variables.

'ABS_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the absolute value of the single operand, for
     both integer and floating-point types.  This is typically used to
     implement the 'abs', 'labs' and 'llabs' builtins for integer types,
     and the 'fabs', 'fabsf' and 'fabsl' builtins for floating point
     types.  The type of abs operation can be determined by looking at
     the type of the expression.

     This node is not used for complex types.  To represent the modulus
     or complex abs of a complex value, use the 'BUILT_IN_CABS',
     'BUILT_IN_CABSF' or 'BUILT_IN_CABSL' builtins, as used to implement
     the C99 'cabs', 'cabsf' and 'cabsl' built-in functions.

'BIT_NOT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent bitwise complement, and will always have
     integral type.  The only operand is the value to be complemented.

'TRUTH_NOT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent logical negation, and will always have
     integral (or boolean) type.  The operand is the value being
     negated.  The type of the operand and that of the result are always
     of 'BOOLEAN_TYPE' or 'INTEGER_TYPE'.

'PREDECREMENT_EXPR'
'PREINCREMENT_EXPR'
'POSTDECREMENT_EXPR'
'POSTINCREMENT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent increment and decrement expressions.  The
     value of the single operand is computed, and the operand
     incremented or decremented.  In the case of 'PREDECREMENT_EXPR' and
     'PREINCREMENT_EXPR', the value of the expression is the value
     resulting after the increment or decrement; in the case of
     'POSTDECREMENT_EXPR' and 'POSTINCREMENT_EXPR' is the value before
     the increment or decrement occurs.  The type of the operand, like
     that of the result, will be either integral, boolean, or
     floating-point.

'FIX_TRUNC_EXPR'
     These nodes represent conversion of a floating-point value to an
     integer.  The single operand will have a floating-point type, while
     the complete expression will have an integral (or boolean) type.
     The operand is rounded towards zero.

'FLOAT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent conversion of an integral (or boolean) value
     to a floating-point value.  The single operand will have integral
     type, while the complete expression will have a floating-point
     type.

     FIXME: How is the operand supposed to be rounded?  Is this
     dependent on '-mieee'?

'COMPLEX_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent complex numbers constructed from
     two expressions of the same (integer or real) type.  The first
     operand is the real part and the second operand is the imaginary
     part.

'CONJ_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the conjugate of their operand.

'REALPART_EXPR'
'IMAGPART_EXPR'
     These nodes represent respectively the real and the imaginary parts
     of complex numbers (their sole argument).

'NON_LVALUE_EXPR'
     These nodes indicate that their one and only operand is not an
     lvalue.  A back end can treat these identically to the single
     operand.

'NOP_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent conversions that do not require
     any code-generation.  For example, conversion of a 'char*' to an
     'int*' does not require any code be generated; such a conversion is
     represented by a 'NOP_EXPR'.  The single operand is the expression
     to be converted.  The conversion from a pointer to a reference is
     also represented with a 'NOP_EXPR'.

'CONVERT_EXPR'
     These nodes are similar to 'NOP_EXPR's, but are used in those
     situations where code may need to be generated.  For example, if an
     'int*' is converted to an 'int' code may need to be generated on
     some platforms.  These nodes are never used for C++-specific
     conversions, like conversions between pointers to different classes
     in an inheritance hierarchy.  Any adjustments that need to be made
     in such cases are always indicated explicitly.  Similarly, a
     user-defined conversion is never represented by a 'CONVERT_EXPR';
     instead, the function calls are made explicit.

'FIXED_CONVERT_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent conversions that involve
     fixed-point values.  For example, from a fixed-point value to
     another fixed-point value, from an integer to a fixed-point value,
     from a fixed-point value to an integer, from a floating-point value
     to a fixed-point value, or from a fixed-point value to a
     floating-point value.

'LSHIFT_EXPR'
'RSHIFT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent left and right shifts, respectively.  The
     first operand is the value to shift; it will always be of integral
     type.  The second operand is an expression for the number of bits
     by which to shift.  Right shift should be treated as arithmetic,
     i.e., the high-order bits should be zero-filled when the expression
     has unsigned type and filled with the sign bit when the expression
     has signed type.  Note that the result is undefined if the second
     operand is larger than or equal to the first operand's type size.
     Unlike most nodes, these can have a vector as first operand and a
     scalar as second operand.

'BIT_IOR_EXPR'
'BIT_XOR_EXPR'
'BIT_AND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent bitwise inclusive or, bitwise exclusive or,
     and bitwise and, respectively.  Both operands will always have
     integral type.

'TRUTH_ANDIF_EXPR'
'TRUTH_ORIF_EXPR'
     These nodes represent logical "and" and logical "or", respectively.
     These operators are not strict; i.e., the second operand is
     evaluated only if the value of the expression is not determined by
     evaluation of the first operand.  The type of the operands and that
     of the result are always of 'BOOLEAN_TYPE' or 'INTEGER_TYPE'.

'TRUTH_AND_EXPR'
'TRUTH_OR_EXPR'
'TRUTH_XOR_EXPR'
     These nodes represent logical and, logical or, and logical
     exclusive or.  They are strict; both arguments are always
     evaluated.  There are no corresponding operators in C or C++, but
     the front end will sometimes generate these expressions anyhow, if
     it can tell that strictness does not matter.  The type of the
     operands and that of the result are always of 'BOOLEAN_TYPE' or
     'INTEGER_TYPE'.

'POINTER_PLUS_EXPR'
     This node represents pointer arithmetic.  The first operand is
     always a pointer/reference type.  The second operand is always an
     unsigned integer type compatible with sizetype.  This is the only
     binary arithmetic operand that can operate on pointer types.

'PLUS_EXPR'
'MINUS_EXPR'
'MULT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent various binary arithmetic operations.
     Respectively, these operations are addition, subtraction (of the
     second operand from the first) and multiplication.  Their operands
     may have either integral or floating type, but there will never be
     case in which one operand is of floating type and the other is of
     integral type.

     The behavior of these operations on signed arithmetic overflow is
     controlled by the 'flag_wrapv' and 'flag_trapv' variables.

'MULT_HIGHPART_EXPR'
     This node represents the "high-part" of a widening multiplication.
     For an integral type with B bits of precision, the result is the
     most significant B bits of the full 2B product.

'RDIV_EXPR'
     This node represents a floating point division operation.

'TRUNC_DIV_EXPR'
'FLOOR_DIV_EXPR'
'CEIL_DIV_EXPR'
'ROUND_DIV_EXPR'
     These nodes represent integer division operations that return an
     integer result.  'TRUNC_DIV_EXPR' rounds towards zero,
     'FLOOR_DIV_EXPR' rounds towards negative infinity, 'CEIL_DIV_EXPR'
     rounds towards positive infinity and 'ROUND_DIV_EXPR' rounds to the
     closest integer.  Integer division in C and C++ is truncating, i.e.
     'TRUNC_DIV_EXPR'.

     The behavior of these operations on signed arithmetic overflow,
     when dividing the minimum signed integer by minus one, is
     controlled by the 'flag_wrapv' and 'flag_trapv' variables.

'TRUNC_MOD_EXPR'
'FLOOR_MOD_EXPR'
'CEIL_MOD_EXPR'
'ROUND_MOD_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the integer remainder or modulus operation.
     The integer modulus of two operands 'a' and 'b' is defined as 'a -
     (a/b)*b' where the division calculated using the corresponding
     division operator.  Hence for 'TRUNC_MOD_EXPR' this definition
     assumes division using truncation towards zero, i.e.
     'TRUNC_DIV_EXPR'.  Integer remainder in C and C++ uses truncating
     division, i.e. 'TRUNC_MOD_EXPR'.

'EXACT_DIV_EXPR'
     The 'EXACT_DIV_EXPR' code is used to represent integer divisions
     where the numerator is known to be an exact multiple of the
     denominator.  This allows the backend to choose between the faster
     of 'TRUNC_DIV_EXPR', 'CEIL_DIV_EXPR' and 'FLOOR_DIV_EXPR' for the
     current target.

'LT_EXPR'
'LE_EXPR'
'GT_EXPR'
'GE_EXPR'
'EQ_EXPR'
'NE_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the less than, less than or equal to, greater
     than, greater than or equal to, equal, and not equal comparison
     operators.  The first and second operands will either be both of
     integral type, both of floating type or both of vector type.  The
     result type of these expressions will always be of integral,
     boolean or signed integral vector type.  These operations return
     the result type's zero value for false, the result type's one value
     for true, and a vector whose elements are zero (false) or minus one
     (true) for vectors.

     For floating point comparisons, if we honor IEEE NaNs and either
     operand is NaN, then 'NE_EXPR' always returns true and the
     remaining operators always return false.  On some targets,
     comparisons against an IEEE NaN, other than equality and
     inequality, may generate a floating point exception.

'ORDERED_EXPR'
'UNORDERED_EXPR'
     These nodes represent non-trapping ordered and unordered comparison
     operators.  These operations take two floating point operands and
     determine whether they are ordered or unordered relative to each
     other.  If either operand is an IEEE NaN, their comparison is
     defined to be unordered, otherwise the comparison is defined to be
     ordered.  The result type of these expressions will always be of
     integral or boolean type.  These operations return the result
     type's zero value for false, and the result type's one value for
     true.

'UNLT_EXPR'
'UNLE_EXPR'
'UNGT_EXPR'
'UNGE_EXPR'
'UNEQ_EXPR'
'LTGT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent the unordered comparison operators.  These
     operations take two floating point operands and determine whether
     the operands are unordered or are less than, less than or equal to,
     greater than, greater than or equal to, or equal respectively.  For
     example, 'UNLT_EXPR' returns true if either operand is an IEEE NaN
     or the first operand is less than the second.  With the possible
     exception of 'LTGT_EXPR', all of these operations are guaranteed
     not to generate a floating point exception.  The result type of
     these expressions will always be of integral or boolean type.
     These operations return the result type's zero value for false, and
     the result type's one value for true.

'MODIFY_EXPR'
     These nodes represent assignment.  The left-hand side is the first
     operand; the right-hand side is the second operand.  The left-hand
     side will be a 'VAR_DECL', 'INDIRECT_REF', 'COMPONENT_REF', or
     other lvalue.

     These nodes are used to represent not only assignment with '=' but
     also compound assignments (like '+='), by reduction to '='
     assignment.  In other words, the representation for 'i += 3' looks
     just like that for 'i = i + 3'.

'INIT_EXPR'
     These nodes are just like 'MODIFY_EXPR', but are used only when a
     variable is initialized, rather than assigned to subsequently.
     This means that we can assume that the target of the initialization
     is not used in computing its own value; any reference to the lhs in
     computing the rhs is undefined.

'COMPOUND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent comma-expressions.  The first operand is an
     expression whose value is computed and thrown away prior to the
     evaluation of the second operand.  The value of the entire
     expression is the value of the second operand.

'COND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent '?:' expressions.  The first operand is of
     boolean or integral type.  If it evaluates to a nonzero value, the
     second operand should be evaluated, and returned as the value of
     the expression.  Otherwise, the third operand is evaluated, and
     returned as the value of the expression.

     The second operand must have the same type as the entire
     expression, unless it unconditionally throws an exception or calls
     a noreturn function, in which case it should have void type.  The
     same constraints apply to the third operand.  This allows array
     bounds checks to be represented conveniently as '(i >= 0 && i < 10)
     ? i : abort()'.

     As a GNU extension, the C language front-ends allow the second
     operand of the '?:' operator may be omitted in the source.  For
     example, 'x ? : 3' is equivalent to 'x ? x : 3', assuming that 'x'
     is an expression without side-effects.  In the tree representation,
     however, the second operand is always present, possibly protected
     by 'SAVE_EXPR' if the first argument does cause side-effects.

'CALL_EXPR'
     These nodes are used to represent calls to functions, including
     non-static member functions.  'CALL_EXPR's are implemented as
     expression nodes with a variable number of operands.  Rather than
     using 'TREE_OPERAND' to extract them, it is preferable to use the
     specialized accessor macros and functions that operate specifically
     on 'CALL_EXPR' nodes.

     'CALL_EXPR_FN' returns a pointer to the function to call; it is
     always an expression whose type is a 'POINTER_TYPE'.

     The number of arguments to the call is returned by
     'call_expr_nargs', while the arguments themselves can be accessed
     with the 'CALL_EXPR_ARG' macro.  The arguments are zero-indexed and
     numbered left-to-right.  You can iterate over the arguments using
     'FOR_EACH_CALL_EXPR_ARG', as in:

          tree call, arg;
          call_expr_arg_iterator iter;
          FOR_EACH_CALL_EXPR_ARG (arg, iter, call)
            /* arg is bound to successive arguments of call.  */
            ...;

     For non-static member functions, there will be an operand
     corresponding to the 'this' pointer.  There will always be
     expressions corresponding to all of the arguments, even if the
     function is declared with default arguments and some arguments are
     not explicitly provided at the call sites.

     'CALL_EXPR's also have a 'CALL_EXPR_STATIC_CHAIN' operand that is
     used to implement nested functions.  This operand is otherwise
     null.

'CLEANUP_POINT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent full-expressions.  The single operand is an
     expression to evaluate.  Any destructor calls engendered by the
     creation of temporaries during the evaluation of that expression
     should be performed immediately after the expression is evaluated.

'CONSTRUCTOR'
     These nodes represent the brace-enclosed initializers for a
     structure or an array.  They contain a sequence of component values
     made out of a vector of constructor_elt, which is a ('INDEX',
     'VALUE') pair.

     If the 'TREE_TYPE' of the 'CONSTRUCTOR' is a 'RECORD_TYPE',
     'UNION_TYPE' or 'QUAL_UNION_TYPE' then the 'INDEX' of each node in
     the sequence will be a 'FIELD_DECL' and the 'VALUE' will be the
     expression used to initialize that field.

     If the 'TREE_TYPE' of the 'CONSTRUCTOR' is an 'ARRAY_TYPE', then
     the 'INDEX' of each node in the sequence will be an 'INTEGER_CST'
     or a 'RANGE_EXPR' of two 'INTEGER_CST's.  A single 'INTEGER_CST'
     indicates which element of the array is being assigned to.  A
     'RANGE_EXPR' indicates an inclusive range of elements to
     initialize.  In both cases the 'VALUE' is the corresponding
     initializer.  It is re-evaluated for each element of a
     'RANGE_EXPR'.  If the 'INDEX' is 'NULL_TREE', then the initializer
     is for the next available array element.

     In the front end, you should not depend on the fields appearing in
     any particular order.  However, in the middle end, fields must
     appear in declaration order.  You should not assume that all fields
     will be represented.  Unrepresented fields will be cleared
     (zeroed), unless the CONSTRUCTOR_NO_CLEARING flag is set, in which
     case their value becomes undefined.

'COMPOUND_LITERAL_EXPR'
     These nodes represent ISO C99 compound literals.  The
     'COMPOUND_LITERAL_EXPR_DECL_EXPR' is a 'DECL_EXPR' containing an
     anonymous 'VAR_DECL' for the unnamed object represented by the
     compound literal; the 'DECL_INITIAL' of that 'VAR_DECL' is a
     'CONSTRUCTOR' representing the brace-enclosed list of initializers
     in the compound literal.  That anonymous 'VAR_DECL' can also be
     accessed directly by the 'COMPOUND_LITERAL_EXPR_DECL' macro.

'SAVE_EXPR'

     A 'SAVE_EXPR' represents an expression (possibly involving
     side-effects) that is used more than once.  The side-effects should
     occur only the first time the expression is evaluated.  Subsequent
     uses should just reuse the computed value.  The first operand to
     the 'SAVE_EXPR' is the expression to evaluate.  The side-effects
     should be executed where the 'SAVE_EXPR' is first encountered in a
     depth-first preorder traversal of the expression tree.

'TARGET_EXPR'
     A 'TARGET_EXPR' represents a temporary object.  The first operand
     is a 'VAR_DECL' for the temporary variable.  The second operand is
     the initializer for the temporary.  The initializer is evaluated
     and, if non-void, copied (bitwise) into the temporary.  If the
     initializer is void, that means that it will perform the
     initialization itself.

     Often, a 'TARGET_EXPR' occurs on the right-hand side of an
     assignment, or as the second operand to a comma-expression which is
     itself the right-hand side of an assignment, etc.  In this case, we
     say that the 'TARGET_EXPR' is "normal"; otherwise, we say it is
     "orphaned".  For a normal 'TARGET_EXPR' the temporary variable
     should be treated as an alias for the left-hand side of the
     assignment, rather than as a new temporary variable.

     The third operand to the 'TARGET_EXPR', if present, is a
     cleanup-expression (i.e., destructor call) for the temporary.  If
     this expression is orphaned, then this expression must be executed
     when the statement containing this expression is complete.  These
     cleanups must always be executed in the order opposite to that in
     which they were encountered.  Note that if a temporary is created
     on one branch of a conditional operator (i.e., in the second or
     third operand to a 'COND_EXPR'), the cleanup must be run only if
     that branch is actually executed.

'VA_ARG_EXPR'
     This node is used to implement support for the C/C++ variable
     argument-list mechanism.  It represents expressions like 'va_arg
     (ap, type)'.  Its 'TREE_TYPE' yields the tree representation for
     'type' and its sole argument yields the representation for 'ap'.

'ANNOTATE_EXPR'
     This node is used to attach markers to an expression.  The first
     operand is the annotated expression, the second is an 'INTEGER_CST'
     with a value from 'enum annot_expr_kind'.

10.6.4 Vectors
--------------

'VEC_LSHIFT_EXPR'
'VEC_RSHIFT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent whole vector left and right shifts,
     respectively.  The first operand is the vector to shift; it will
     always be of vector type.  The second operand is an expression for
     the number of bits by which to shift.  Note that the result is
     undefined if the second operand is larger than or equal to the
     first operand's type size.

'VEC_WIDEN_MULT_HI_EXPR'
'VEC_WIDEN_MULT_LO_EXPR'
     These nodes represent widening vector multiplication of the high
     and low parts of the two input vectors, respectively.  Their
     operands are vectors that contain the same number of elements ('N')
     of the same integral type.  The result is a vector that contains
     half as many elements, of an integral type whose size is twice as
     wide.  In the case of 'VEC_WIDEN_MULT_HI_EXPR' the high 'N/2'
     elements of the two vector are multiplied to produce the vector of
     'N/2' products.  In the case of 'VEC_WIDEN_MULT_LO_EXPR' the low
     'N/2' elements of the two vector are multiplied to produce the
     vector of 'N/2' products.

'VEC_UNPACK_HI_EXPR'
'VEC_UNPACK_LO_EXPR'
     These nodes represent unpacking of the high and low parts of the
     input vector, respectively.  The single operand is a vector that
     contains 'N' elements of the same integral or floating point type.
     The result is a vector that contains half as many elements, of an
     integral or floating point type whose size is twice as wide.  In
     the case of 'VEC_UNPACK_HI_EXPR' the high 'N/2' elements of the
     vector are extracted and widened (promoted).  In the case of
     'VEC_UNPACK_LO_EXPR' the low 'N/2' elements of the vector are
     extracted and widened (promoted).

'VEC_UNPACK_FLOAT_HI_EXPR'
'VEC_UNPACK_FLOAT_LO_EXPR'
     These nodes represent unpacking of the high and low parts of the
     input vector, where the values are converted from fixed point to
     floating point.  The single operand is a vector that contains 'N'
     elements of the same integral type.  The result is a vector that
     contains half as many elements of a floating point type whose size
     is twice as wide.  In the case of 'VEC_UNPACK_HI_EXPR' the high
     'N/2' elements of the vector are extracted, converted and widened.
     In the case of 'VEC_UNPACK_LO_EXPR' the low 'N/2' elements of the
     vector are extracted, converted and widened.

'VEC_PACK_TRUNC_EXPR'
     This node represents packing of truncated elements of the two input
     vectors into the output vector.  Input operands are vectors that
     contain the same number of elements of the same integral or
     floating point type.  The result is a vector that contains twice as
     many elements of an integral or floating point type whose size is
     half as wide.  The elements of the two vectors are demoted and
     merged (concatenated) to form the output vector.

'VEC_PACK_SAT_EXPR'
     This node represents packing of elements of the two input vectors
     into the output vector using saturation.  Input operands are
     vectors that contain the same number of elements of the same
     integral type.  The result is a vector that contains twice as many
     elements of an integral type whose size is half as wide.  The
     elements of the two vectors are demoted and merged (concatenated)
     to form the output vector.

'VEC_PACK_FIX_TRUNC_EXPR'
     This node represents packing of elements of the two input vectors
     into the output vector, where the values are converted from
     floating point to fixed point.  Input operands are vectors that
     contain the same number of elements of a floating point type.  The
     result is a vector that contains twice as many elements of an
     integral type whose size is half as wide.  The elements of the two
     vectors are merged (concatenated) to form the output vector.

'VEC_COND_EXPR'
     These nodes represent '?:' expressions.  The three operands must be
     vectors of the same size and number of elements.  The second and
     third operands must have the same type as the entire expression.
     The first operand is of signed integral vector type.  If an element
     of the first operand evaluates to a zero value, the corresponding
     element of the result is taken from the third operand.  If it
     evaluates to a minus one value, it is taken from the second
     operand.  It should never evaluate to any other value currently,
     but optimizations should not rely on that property.  In contrast
     with a 'COND_EXPR', all operands are always evaluated.

10.7 Statements
===============

Most statements in GIMPLE are assignment statements, represented by
'GIMPLE_ASSIGN'.  No other C expressions can appear at statement level;
a reference to a volatile object is converted into a 'GIMPLE_ASSIGN'.

 There are also several varieties of complex statements.

10.7.1 Basic Statements
-----------------------

'ASM_EXPR'

     Used to represent an inline assembly statement.  For an inline
     assembly statement like:
          asm ("mov x, y");
     The 'ASM_STRING' macro will return a 'STRING_CST' node for '"mov x,
     y"'.  If the original statement made use of the extended-assembly
     syntax, then 'ASM_OUTPUTS', 'ASM_INPUTS', and 'ASM_CLOBBERS' will
     be the outputs, inputs, and clobbers for the statement, represented
     as 'STRING_CST' nodes.  The extended-assembly syntax looks like:
          asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
     The first string is the 'ASM_STRING', containing the instruction
     template.  The next two strings are the output and inputs,
     respectively; this statement has no clobbers.  As this example
     indicates, "plain" assembly statements are merely a special case of
     extended assembly statements; they have no cv-qualifiers, outputs,
     inputs, or clobbers.  All of the strings will be 'NUL'-terminated,
     and will contain no embedded 'NUL'-characters.

     If the assembly statement is declared 'volatile', or if the
     statement was not an extended assembly statement, and is therefore
     implicitly volatile, then the predicate 'ASM_VOLATILE_P' will hold
     of the 'ASM_EXPR'.

'DECL_EXPR'

     Used to represent a local declaration.  The 'DECL_EXPR_DECL' macro
     can be used to obtain the entity declared.  This declaration may be
     a 'LABEL_DECL', indicating that the label declared is a local
     label.  (As an extension, GCC allows the declaration of labels with
     scope.)  In C, this declaration may be a 'FUNCTION_DECL',
     indicating the use of the GCC nested function extension.  For more
     information, *note Functions::.

'LABEL_EXPR'

     Used to represent a label.  The 'LABEL_DECL' declared by this
     statement can be obtained with the 'LABEL_EXPR_LABEL' macro.  The
     'IDENTIFIER_NODE' giving the name of the label can be obtained from
     the 'LABEL_DECL' with 'DECL_NAME'.

'GOTO_EXPR'

     Used to represent a 'goto' statement.  The 'GOTO_DESTINATION' will
     usually be a 'LABEL_DECL'.  However, if the "computed goto"
     extension has been used, the 'GOTO_DESTINATION' will be an
     arbitrary expression indicating the destination.  This expression
     will always have pointer type.

'RETURN_EXPR'

     Used to represent a 'return' statement.  Operand 0 represents the
     value to return.  It should either be the 'RESULT_DECL' for the
     containing function, or a 'MODIFY_EXPR' or 'INIT_EXPR' setting the
     function's 'RESULT_DECL'.  It will be 'NULL_TREE' if the statement
     was just
          return;

'LOOP_EXPR'
     These nodes represent "infinite" loops.  The 'LOOP_EXPR_BODY'
     represents the body of the loop.  It should be executed forever,
     unless an 'EXIT_EXPR' is encountered.

'EXIT_EXPR'
     These nodes represent conditional exits from the nearest enclosing
     'LOOP_EXPR'.  The single operand is the condition; if it is
     nonzero, then the loop should be exited.  An 'EXIT_EXPR' will only
     appear within a 'LOOP_EXPR'.

'SWITCH_STMT'

     Used to represent a 'switch' statement.  The 'SWITCH_STMT_COND' is
     the expression on which the switch is occurring.  See the
     documentation for an 'IF_STMT' for more information on the
     representation used for the condition.  The 'SWITCH_STMT_BODY' is
     the body of the switch statement.  The 'SWITCH_STMT_TYPE' is the
     original type of switch expression as given in the source, before
     any compiler conversions.

'CASE_LABEL_EXPR'

     Use to represent a 'case' label, range of 'case' labels, or a
     'default' label.  If 'CASE_LOW' is 'NULL_TREE', then this is a
     'default' label.  Otherwise, if 'CASE_HIGH' is 'NULL_TREE', then
     this is an ordinary 'case' label.  In this case, 'CASE_LOW' is an
     expression giving the value of the label.  Both 'CASE_LOW' and
     'CASE_HIGH' are 'INTEGER_CST' nodes.  These values will have the
     same type as the condition expression in the switch statement.

     Otherwise, if both 'CASE_LOW' and 'CASE_HIGH' are defined, the
     statement is a range of case labels.  Such statements originate
     with the extension that allows users to write things of the form:
          case 2 ... 5:
     The first value will be 'CASE_LOW', while the second will be
     'CASE_HIGH'.

10.7.2 Blocks
-------------

Block scopes and the variables they declare in GENERIC are expressed
using the 'BIND_EXPR' code, which in previous versions of GCC was
primarily used for the C statement-expression extension.

 Variables in a block are collected into 'BIND_EXPR_VARS' in declaration
order through their 'TREE_CHAIN' field.  Any runtime initialization is
moved out of 'DECL_INITIAL' and into a statement in the controlled
block.  When gimplifying from C or C++, this initialization replaces the
'DECL_STMT'.  These variables will never require cleanups.  The scope of
these variables is just the body

 Variable-length arrays (VLAs) complicate this process, as their size
often refers to variables initialized earlier in the block.  To handle
this, we currently split the block at that point, and move the VLA into
a new, inner 'BIND_EXPR'.  This strategy may change in the future.

 A C++ program will usually contain more 'BIND_EXPR's than there are
syntactic blocks in the source code, since several C++ constructs have
implicit scopes associated with them.  On the other hand, although the
C++ front end uses pseudo-scopes to handle cleanups for objects with
destructors, these don't translate into the GIMPLE form; multiple
declarations at the same level use the same 'BIND_EXPR'.

10.7.3 Statement Sequences
--------------------------

Multiple statements at the same nesting level are collected into a
'STATEMENT_LIST'.  Statement lists are modified and traversed using the
interface in 'tree-iterator.h'.

10.7.4 Empty Statements
-----------------------

Whenever possible, statements with no effect are discarded.  But if they
are nested within another construct which cannot be discarded for some
reason, they are instead replaced with an empty statement, generated by
'build_empty_stmt'.  Initially, all empty statements were shared, after
the pattern of the Java front end, but this caused a lot of trouble in
practice.

 An empty statement is represented as '(void)0'.
