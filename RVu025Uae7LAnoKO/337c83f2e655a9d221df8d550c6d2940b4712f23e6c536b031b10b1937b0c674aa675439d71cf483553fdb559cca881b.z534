and thus the user must know the exact indices
that table entries will have.

7.54 `.fill REPEAT , SIZE , VALUE'
==================================

REPEAT, SIZE and VALUE are absolute expressions.  This emits REPEAT
copies of SIZE bytes.  REPEAT may be zero or more.  SIZE may be zero or
more, but if it is more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8,
compatible with other people's assemblers.  The contents of each REPEAT
bytes is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are VALUE rendered in the byte-order of
an integer on the computer `as' is assembling for.  Each SIZE bytes in
a repetition is taken from the lowest order SIZE bytes of this number.
Again, this bizarre behavior is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   SIZE and VALUE are optional.  If the second comma and VALUE are
absent, VALUE is assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens
are absent, SIZE is assumed to be 1.

7.55 `.float FLONUMS'
=====================

This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
has the same effect as `.single'.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Func,  Next: Global,  Prev: Float,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.56 `.func NAME[,LABEL]'
=========================

`.func' emits debugging information to denote function NAME, and is
ignored unless the file is assembled with debugging enabled.  Only
`--gstabs[+]' is currently supported.  LABEL is the entry point of the
function and if omitted NAME prepended with the `leading char' is used.
`leading char' is usually `_' or nothing, depending on the target.  All
functions are currently defined to have `void' return type.  The
function must be terminated with `.endfunc'.


File: as.info,  Node: Global,  Next: Gnu_attribute,  Prev: Func,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.57 `.global SYMBOL', `.globl SYMBOL'
======================================

`.global' makes the symbol visible to `ld'.  If you define SYMBOL in
your partial program, its value is made available to other partial
programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise, SYMBOL takes its
attributes from a symbol of the same name from another file linked into
the same program.

   Both spellings (`.globl' and `.global') are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

   On the HPPA, `.global' is not always enough to make it accessible to
other partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only `.EXPORT' directive
as well.  *Note HPPA Assembler Directives: HPPA Directives.


File: as.info,  Node: Gnu_attribute,  Next: Hidden,  Prev: Global,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.58 `.gnu_attribute TAG,VALUE'
===============================

Record a GNU object attribute for this file.  *Note Object Attributes::.


File: as.info,  Node: Hidden,  Next: hword,  Prev: Gnu_attribute,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.59 `.hidden NAMES'
====================

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.internal' (*note `.internal': Internal.) and `.protected' (*note
`.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `hidden' which means that the symbols are not visible
to other components.  Such symbols are always considered to be
`protected' as well.


File: as.info,  Node: hword,  Next: Ident,  Prev: Hidden,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.60 `.hword EXPRESSIONS'
=========================

This expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, and emits a 16 bit number for
each.

   This directive is a synonym for `.short'; depending on the target
architecture, it may also be a synonym for `.word'.


File: as.info,  Node: Ident,  Next: If,  Prev: hword,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.61 `.ident'
=============

This directive is used by some assemblers to place tags in object
files.  The behavior of this directive varies depending on the target.
When using the a.out object file format, `as' simply accepts the
directive for source-file compatibility with existing assemblers, but
does not emit anything for it.  When using COFF, comments are emitted
to the `.comment' or `.rdata' section, depending on the target.  When
using ELF, comments are emitted to the `.comment' section.


File: as.info,  Node: If,  Next: Incbin,  Prev: Ident,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.62 `.if ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
==============================

`.if' marks the beginning of a section of code which is only considered
part of the source program being assembled if the argument (which must
be an ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION) is non-zero.  The end of the conditional
section of code must be marked by `.endif' (*note `.endif': Endif.);
optionally, you may include code for the alternative condition, flagged
by `.else' (*note `.else': Else.).  If you have several conditions to
check, `.elseif' may be used to avoid nesting blocks if/else within
each subsequent `.else' block.

   The following variants of `.if' are also supported:
`.ifdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has been defined.  Note a symbol which has been referenced but not
     yet defined is considered to be undefined.

`.ifb TEXT'
     Assembles the following section of code if the operand is blank
     (empty).

`.ifc STRING1,STRING2'
     Assembles the following section of code if the two strings are the
     same.  The strings may be optionally quoted with single quotes.
     If they are not quoted, the first string stops at the first comma,
     and the second string stops at the end of the line.  Strings which
     contain whitespace should be quoted.  The string comparison is
     case sensitive.

`.ifeq ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is zero.

`.ifeqs STRING1,STRING2'
     Another form of `.ifc'.  The strings must be quoted using double
     quotes.

`.ifge ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than or equal to zero.

`.ifgt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than zero.

`.ifle ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than or equal to zero.

`.iflt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than zero.

`.ifnb TEXT'
     Like `.ifb', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the operand is non-blank
     (non-empty).

`.ifnc STRING1,STRING2.'
     Like `.ifc', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the two strings are not the same.

`.ifndef SYMBOL'
`.ifnotdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has not been defined.  Both spelling variants are equivalent.
     Note a symbol which has been referenced but not yet defined is
     considered to be undefined.

`.ifne ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is not
     equal to zero (in other words, this is equivalent to `.if').

`.ifnes STRING1,STRING2'
     Like `.ifeqs', but the sense of the test is reversed: this
     assembles the following section of code if the two strings are not
     the same.

7.63 `.incbin "FILE"[,SKIP[,COUNT]]'
====================================

The `incbin' directive includes FILE verbatim at the current location.
You can control the search paths used with the `-I' command-line option
(*note Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation marks are required
around FILE.

   The SKIP argument skips a number of bytes from the start of the
FILE.  The COUNT argument indicates the maximum number of bytes to
read.  Note that the data is not aligned in any way, so it is the user's
responsibility to make sure that proper alignment is provided both
before and after the `incbin' directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Include,  Next: Int,  Prev: Incbin,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.64 `.include "FILE"'
======================

This directive provides a way to include supporting files at specified
points in your source program.  The code from FILE is assembled as if
it followed the point of the `.include'; when the end of the included
file is reached, assembly of the original file continues.  You can
control the search paths used with the `-I' command-line option (*note
Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation marks are required around
FILE.


File: as.info,  Node: Int,  Next: Internal,  Prev: Include,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.65 `.int EXPRESSIONS'
=======================

Expect zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of
that expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on
what kind of target the assembly is for.


File: as.info,  Node: Internal,  Next: Irp,  Prev: Int,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.66 `.internal NAMES'
======================

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.hidden' (*note `.hidden': Hidden.) and `.protected' (*note
`.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `internal' which means that the symbols are
considered to be `hidden' (i.e., not visible to other components), and
that some extra, processor specific processing must also be performed
upon the  symbols as well.


File: as.info,  Node: Irp,  Next: Irpc,  Prev: Internal,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.67 `.irp SYMBOL,VALUES'...
============================

Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to SYMBOL.
The sequence of statements starts at the `.irp' directive, and is
terminated by an `.endr' directive.  For each VALUE, SYMBOL is set to
VALUE, and the sequence of statements is assembled.  If no VALUE is
listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once, with SYMBOL set
to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL within the sequence of
statements, use \SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irp    param,1,2,3
             move    d\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

   For some caveats with the spelling of SYMBOL, see also *note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Irpc,  Next: Lcomm,  Prev: Irp,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.68 `.irpc SYMBOL,VALUES'...
=============================

Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to SYMBOL.
The sequence of statements starts at the `.irpc' directive, and is
terminated by an `.endr' directive.  For each character in VALUE,
SYMBOL is set to the character, and the sequence of statements is
assembled.  If no VALUE is listed, the sequence of statements is
assembled once, with SYMBOL set to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL
within the sequence of statements, use \SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irpc    param,123
             move    d\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

   For some caveats with the spelling of SYMBOL, see also the discussion
at *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Lcomm,  Next: Lflags,  Prev: Irpc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.69 `.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH'
=============================

Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of the
new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss section, so
that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  SYMBOL is not declared
global (*note `.global': Global.), so is normally not visible to `ld'.

   Some targets permit a third argument to be used with `.lcomm'.  This
argument specifies the desired alignment of the symbol in the bss
section.

   The syntax for `.lcomm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .lcomm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.


File: as.info,  Node: Lflags,  Next: Line,  Prev: Lcomm,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.70 `.lflags'
==============

`as' accepts this directive, for compatibility with other assemblers,
but ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Line,  Next: Linkonce,  Prev: Lflags,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.71 `.line LINE-NUMBER'
========================

Change the logical line number.  LINE-NUMBER must be an absolute
expression.  The next line has that logical line number.  Therefore any
other statements on the current line (after a statement separator
character) are reported as on logical line number LINE-NUMBER - 1.  One
day `as' will no longer support this directive: it is recognized only
for compatibility with existing assembler programs.

Even though this is a directive associated with the `a.out' or `b.out'
object-code formats, `as' still recognizes it when producing COFF
output, and treats `.line' as though it were the COFF `.ln' _if_ it is
found outside a `.def'/`.endef' pair.

   Inside a `.def', `.line' is, instead, one of the directives used by
compilers to generate auxiliary symbol information for debugging.


File: as.info,  Node: Linkonce,  Next: List,  Prev: Line,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.72 `.linkonce [TYPE]'
=======================

Mark the current section so that the linker only includes a single copy
of it.  This may be used to include the same section in several
different object files, but ensure that the linker will only include it
once in the final output file.  The `.linkonce' pseudo-op must be used
for each instance of the section.  Duplicate sections are detected
based on the section name, so it should be unique.

   This directive is only supported by a few object file formats; as of
this writing, the only object file format which supports it is the
Portable Executable format used on Windows NT.

   The TYPE argument is optional.  If specified, it must be one of the
following strings.  For example:
     .linkonce same_size
   Not all types may be supported on all object file formats.

`discard'
     Silently discard duplicate sections.  This is the default.

`one_only'
     Warn if there are duplicate sections, but still keep only one copy.

`same_size'
     Warn if any of the duplicates have different sizes.

`same_contents'
     Warn if any of the duplicates do not have exactly the same
     contents.


File: as.info,  Node: List,  Next: Ln,  Prev: Linkonce,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.73 `.list'
============

Control (in conjunction with the `.nolist' directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   `.list' increments the
counter, and `.nolist' decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.

   By default, listings are disabled.  When you enable them (with the
`-a' command line option; *note Command-Line Options: Invoking.), the
initial value of the listing counter is one.

7.75 `.loc FILENO LINENO [COLUMN] [OPTIONS]'
============================================

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, the `.loc' directive will
add a row to the `.debug_line' line number matrix corresponding to the
immediately following assembly instruction.  The FILENO, LINENO, and
optional COLUMN arguments will be applied to the `.debug_line' state
machine before the row is added.

   The OPTIONS are a sequence of the following tokens in any order:

`basic_block'
     This option will set the `basic_block' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to `true'.

`prologue_end'
     This option will set the `prologue_end' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to `true'.

`epilogue_begin'
     This option will set the `epilogue_begin' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to `true'.

`is_stmt VALUE'
     This option will set the `is_stmt' register in the `.debug_line'
     state machine to `value', which must be either 0 or 1.

`isa VALUE'
     This directive will set the `isa' register in the `.debug_line'
     state machine to VALUE, which must be an unsigned integer.

`discriminator VALUE'
     This directive will set the `discriminator' register in the
     `.debug_line' state machine to VALUE, which must be an unsigned
     integer.



File: as.info,  Node: Loc_mark_labels,  Next: Local,  Prev: Loc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.76 `.loc_mark_labels ENABLE'
==============================

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, the `.loc_mark_labels'
directive makes the assembler emit an entry to the `.debug_line' line
number matrix with the `basic_block' register in the state machine set
whenever a code label is seen.  The ENABLE argument should be either 1
or 0, to enable or disable this function respectively.


File: as.info,  Node: Local,  Next: Long,  Prev: Loc_mark_labels,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.77 `.local NAMES'
===================

This directive, which is available for ELF targets, marks each symbol in
the comma-separated list of `names' as a local symbol so that it will
not be externally visible.  If the symbols do not already exist, they
will be created.

   For targets where the `.lcomm' directive (*note Lcomm::) does not
accept an alignment argument, which is the case for most ELF targets,
the `.local' directive can be used in combination with `.comm' (*note
Comm::) to define aligned local common data.


File: as.info,  Node: Long,  Next: Macro,  Prev: Local,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.78 `.long EXPRESSIONS'
========================

`.long' is the same as `.int'.  *Note `.int': Int.


File: as.info,  Node: Macro,  Next: MRI,  Prev: Long,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.79 `.macro'
=============

The commands `.macro' and `.endm' allow you to define macros that
generate assembly output.  For example, this definition specifies a
macro `sum' that puts a sequence of numbers into memory:

             .macro  sum from=0, to=5
             .long   \from
             .if     \to-\from
             sum     "(\from+1)",\to
             .endif
             .endm

With that definition, `SUM 0,5' is equivalent to this assembly input:

             .long   0
             .long   1
             .long   2
             .long   3
             .long   4
             .long   5

`.macro MACNAME'
`.macro MACNAME MACARGS ...'
     Begin the definition of a macro called MACNAME.  If your macro
     definition requires arguments, specify their names after the macro
     name, separated by commas or spaces.  You can qualify the macro
     argument to indicate whether all invocations must specify a
     non-blank value (through `:`req''), or whether it takes all of the
     remaining arguments (through `:`vararg'').  You can supply a
     default value for any macro argument by following the name with
     `=DEFLT'.  You cannot define two macros with the same MACNAME
     unless it has been subject to the `.purgem' directive (*note
     Purgem::) between the two definitions.  For example, these are all
     valid `.macro' statements:

    `.macro comm'
          Begin the definition of a macro called `comm', which takes no
          arguments.

    `.macro plus1 p, p1'
    `.macro plus1 p p1'
          Either statement begins the definition of a macro called
          `plus1', which takes two arguments; within the macro
          definition, write `\p' or `\p1' to evaluate the arguments.

    `.macro reserve_str p1=0 p2'
          Begin the definition of a macro called `reserve_str', with two
          arguments.  The first argument has a default value, but not
          the second.  After the definition is complete, you can call
          the macro either as `reserve_str A,B' (with `\p1' evaluating
          to A and `\p2' evaluating to B), or as `reserve_str ,B' (with
          `\p1' evaluating as the default, in this case `0', and `\p2'
          evaluating to B).

    `.macro m p1:req, p2=0, p3:vararg'
          Begin the definition of a macro called `m', with at least
          three arguments.  The first argument must always have a value
          specified, but not the second, which instead has a default
          value. The third formal will get assigned all remaining
          arguments specified at invocation time.

          When you call a macro, you can specify the argument values
          either by position, or by keyword.  For example, `sum 9,17'
          is equivalent to `sum to=17, from=9'.


     Note that since each of the MACARGS can be an identifier exactly
     as any other one permitted by the target architecture, there may be
     occasional problems if the target hand-crafts special meanings to
     certain characters when they occur in a special position.  For
     example, if the colon (`:') is generally permitted to be part of a
     symbol name, but the architecture specific code special-cases it
     when occurring as the final character of a symbol (to denote a
     label), then the macro parameter replacement code will have no way
     of knowing that and consider the whole construct (including the
     colon) an identifier, and check only this identifier for being the
     subject to parameter substitution.  So for example this macro
     definition:

          	.macro label l
          \l:
          	.endm

     might not work as expected.  Invoking `label foo' might not create
     a label called `foo' but instead just insert the text `\l:' into
     the assembler source, probably generating an error about an
     unrecognised identifier.

     Similarly problems might occur with the period character (`.')
     which is often allowed inside opcode names (and hence identifier
     names).  So for example constructing a macro to build an opcode
     from a base name and a length specifier like this:

          	.macro opcode base length
                  \base.\length
          	.endm

     and invoking it as `opcode store l' will not create a `store.l'
     instruction but instead generate some kind of error as the
     assembler tries to interpret the text `\base.\length'.

     There are several possible ways around this problem:

    `Insert white space'
          If it is possible to use white space characters then this is
          the simplest solution.  eg:

               	.macro label l
               \l :
               	.endm

    `Use `\()''
          The string `\()' can be used to separate the end of a macro
          argument from the following text.  eg:

               	.macro opcode base length
                       \base\().\length
               	.endm

    `Use the alternate macro syntax mode'
          In the alternative macro syntax mode the ampersand character
          (`&') can be used as a separator.  eg:

               	.altmacro
               	.macro label l
               l&:
               	.endm

     Note: this problem of correctly identifying string parameters to
     pseudo ops also applies to the identifiers used in `.irp' (*note
     Irp::) and `.irpc' (*note Irpc::) as well.

`.endm'
     Mark the end of a macro definition.

`.exitm'
     Exit early from the current macro definition.

`\@'
     `as' maintains a counter of how many macros it has executed in
     this pseudo-variable; you can copy that number to your output with
     `\@', but _only within a macro definition_.

`LOCAL NAME [ , ... ]'
     _Warning: `LOCAL' is only available if you select "alternate macro
     syntax" with `--alternate' or `.altmacro'._ *Note `.altmacro':

7.80 `.mri VAL'
===============

If VAL is non-zero, this tells `as' to enter MRI mode.  If VAL is zero,
this tells `as' to exit MRI mode.  This change affects code assembled

7.82 `.nolist'
==============

Control (in conjunction with the `.list' directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an

counter, and `.nolist' decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.


File: as.info,  Node: Octa,  Next: Offset,  Prev: Nolist,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.83 `.octa BIGNUMS'
====================

This directive expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For
each bignum, it emits a 16-byte integer.

   The term "octa" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence _octa_-word for 16 bytes.

7.84 `.offset LOC'
==================

Set the location counter to LOC in the absolute section.  LOC must be
an absolute expression.  This directive may be useful for defining
symbols with absolute values.  Do not confuse it with the `.org'
directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Org,  Next: P2align,  Prev: Offset,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.85 `.org NEW-LC , FILL'
=========================

Advance the location counter of the current section to NEW-LC.  NEW-LC
is either an absolute expression or an expression with the same section
as the current subsection.  That is, you can't use `.org' to cross
sections: if NEW-LC has the wrong section, the `.org' directive is
ignored.  To be compatible with former assemblers, if the section of
NEW-LC is absolute, `as' issues a warning, then pretends the section of
NEW-LC is the same as the current subsection.

   `.org' may only increase the location counter, or leave it
unchanged; you cannot use `.org' to move the location counter backwards.

   Because `as' tries to assemble programs in one pass, NEW-LC may not
be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await a
chance to share your improved assembler.

   Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced,
the intervening bytes are filled with FILL which should be an absolute
expression.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL defaults to zero.


File: as.info,  Node: P2align,  Next: PopSection,  Prev: Org,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.86 `.p2align[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
================================================

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example `.p2align 3' advances the location counter
until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.p2alignw' and `.p2alignl' directives are variants of the
`.p2align' directive.  The `.p2alignw' directive treats the fill
pattern as a two byte word value.  The `.p2alignl' directives treats the
fill pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.p2alignw
2,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.

7.87 `.popsection'
==================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), `.pushsection' (*note PushSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive replaces the current section (and subsection) with
the top section (and subsection) on the section stack.  This section is
popped off the stack.


File: as.info,  Node: Previous,  Next: Print,  Prev: PopSection,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.88 `.previous'
================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), `.pushsection' (*note PushSection::), and `.popsection'
(*note PopSection::).

   This directive swaps the current section (and subsection) with most
recently referenced section/subsection pair prior to this one.  Multiple
`.previous' directives in a row will flip between two sections (and
their subsections).  For example:

     .section A
      .subsection 1
       .word 0x1234
      .subsection 2
       .word 0x5678
     .previous
      .word 0x9abc

   Will place 0x1234 and 0x9abc into subsection 1 and 0x5678 into
subsection 2 of section A.  Whilst:

     .section A
     .subsection 1
       # Now in section A subsection 1
       .word 0x1234
     .section B
     .subsection 0
       # Now in section B subsection 0
       .word 0x5678
     .subsection 1
       # Now in section B subsection 1
       .word 0x9abc
     .previous
       # Now in section B subsection 0
       .word 0xdef0

   Will place 0x1234 into section A, 0x5678 and 0xdef0 into subsection
0 of section B and 0x9abc into subsection 1 of section B.

   In terms of the section stack, this directive swaps the current
section with the top section on the section stack.

7.89 `.print STRING'
====================

`as' will print STRING on the standard output during assembly.  You
must put STRING in double quotes.


File: as.info,  Node: Protected,  Next: Psize,  Prev: Print,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.90 `.protected NAMES'
=======================

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.hidden' (*note Hidden::) and `.internal' (*note Internal::).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `protected' which means that any references to the
symbols from within the components that defines them must be resolved
to the definition in that component, even if a definition in another
component would normally preempt this.


File: as.info,  Node: Psize,  Next: Purgem,  Prev: Protected,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.91 `.psize LINES , COLUMNS'
=============================

Use this directive to declare the number of lines--and, optionally, the
number of columns--to use for each page, when generating listings.

   If you do not use `.psize', listings use a default line-count of 60.
You may omit the comma and COLUMNS specification; the default width is
200 columns.

   `as' generates formfeeds whenever the specified number of lines is
exceeded (or whenever you explicitly request one, using `.eject').

   If you specify LINES as `0', no formfeeds are generated save those
explicitly specified with `.eject'.


File: as.info,  Node: Purgem,  Next: PushSection,  Prev: Psize,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.92 `.purgem NAME'
===================

Undefine the macro NAME, so that later uses of the string will not be
expanded.  *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: PushSection,  Next: Quad,  Prev: Purgem,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.93 `.pushsection NAME [, SUBSECTION] [, "FLAGS"[, @TYPE[,ARGUMENTS]]]'
========================================================================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), `.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive pushes the current section (and subsection) onto the
top of the section stack, and then replaces the current section and
subsection with `name' and `subsection'. The optional `flags', `type'
and `arguments' are treated the same as in the `.section' (*note
Section::) directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Quad,  Next: Reloc,  Prev: PushSection,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.94 `.quad BIGNUMS'
====================

`.quad' expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For each
bignum, it emits an 8-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 8
bytes, it prints a warning message; and just takes the lowest order 8
bytes of the bignum.  

   The term "quad" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence _quad_-word for 8 bytes.


File: as.info,  Node: Reloc,  Next: Rept,  Prev: Quad,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.95 `.reloc OFFSET, RELOC_NAME[, EXPRESSION]'
==============================================

Generate a relocation at OFFSET of type RELOC_NAME with value
EXPRESSION.  If OFFSET is a number, the relocation is generated in the
current section.  If OFFSET is an expression that resolves to a symbol
plus offset, the relocation is generated in the given symbol's section.
EXPRESSION, if present, must resolve to a symbol plus addend or to an
absolute value, but note that not all targets support an addend.  e.g.
ELF REL targets such as i386 store an addend in the section contents
rather than in the relocation.  This low level interface does not
support addends stored in the section.


File: as.info,  Node: Rept,  Next: Sbttl,  Prev: Reloc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.96 `.rept COUNT'
==================

Repeat the sequence of lines between the `.rept' directive and the next
`.endr' directive COUNT times.

   For example, assembling

             .rept   3
             .long   0
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             .long   0
             .long   0
             .long   0


File: as.info,  Node: Sbttl,  Next: Scl,  Prev: Rept,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.97 `.sbttl "SUBHEADING"'
==========================

Use SUBHEADING as the title (third line, immediately after the title
line) when generating assembly listings.

   This directive affects subsequent pages, as well as the current page
if it appears within ten lines of the top of a page.


File: as.info,  Node: Scl,  Next: Section,  Prev: Sbttl,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.98 `.scl CLASS'
=================

Set the storage-class value for a symbol.  This directive may only be
used inside a `.def'/`.endef' pair.  Storage class may flag whether a
symbol is static or external, or it may record further symbolic
debugging information.


File: as.info,  Node: Section,  Next: Set,  Prev: Scl,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.99 `.section NAME'
====================

Use the `.section' directive to assemble the following code into a
section named NAME.

   This directive is only supported for targets that actually support
arbitrarily named sections; on `a.out' targets, for example, it is not
accepted, even with a standard `a.out' section name.

COFF Version
------------

   For COFF targets, the `.section' directive is used in one of the
following ways:

     .section NAME[, "FLAGS"]
     .section NAME[, SUBSECTION]

   If the optional argument is quoted, it is taken as flags to use for
the section.  Each flag is a single character.  The following flags are
recognized:
`b'
     bss section (uninitialized data)

`n'
     section is not loaded

`w'
     writable section

`d'
     data section

`e'
     exclude section from linking

`r'
     read-only section

`x'
     executable section

`s'
     shared section (meaningful for PE targets)

`a'
     ignored.  (For compatibility with the ELF version)

`y'
     section is not readable (meaningful for PE targets)

`0-9'
     single-digit power-of-two section alignment (GNU extension)

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to be loaded and writable.  Note the `n' and `w' flags
remove attributes from the section, rather than adding them, so if they
are used on their own it will be as if no flags had been specified at
all.

   If the optional argument to the `.section' directive is not quoted,
it is taken as a subsection number (*note Sub-Sections::).

ELF Version
-----------

   This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.subsection' (*note SubSection::), `.pushsection' (*note
PushSection::), `.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   For ELF targets, the `.section' directive is used like this:

     .section NAME [, "FLAGS"[, @TYPE[,FLAG_SPECIFIC_ARGUMENTS]]]

   The optional FLAGS argument is a quoted string which may contain any
combination of the following characters:
`a'
     section is allocatable

`e'
     section is excluded from executable and shared library.

`w'
     section is writable

`x'
     section is executable

`M'
     section is mergeable

`S'
     section contains zero terminated strings

`G'
     section is a member of a section group

`T'
     section is used for thread-local-storage

`?'
     section is a member of the previously-current section's group, if
     any

   The optional TYPE argument may contain one of the following
constants:
`@progbits'
     section contains data

`@nobits'
     section does not contain data (i.e., section only occupies space)

`@note'
     section contains data which is used by things other than the
     program

`@init_array'
     section contains an array of pointers to init functions

`@fini_array'
     section contains an array of pointers to finish functions

`@preinit_array'
     section contains an array of pointers to pre-init functions

   Many targets only support the first three section types.

   Note on targets where the `@' character is the start of a comment (eg
ARM) then another character is used instead.  For example the ARM port
uses the `%' character.

   If FLAGS contains the `M' symbol then the TYPE argument must be
specified as well as an extra argument--ENTSIZE--like this:

     .section NAME , "FLAGS"M, @TYPE, ENTSIZE

   Sections with the `M' flag but not `S' flag must contain fixed size
constants, each ENTSIZE octets long. Sections with both `M' and `S'
must contain zero terminated strings where each character is ENTSIZE
bytes long. The linker may remove duplicates within sections with the
same name, same entity size and same flags.  ENTSIZE must be an
absolute expression.  For sections with both `M' and `S', a string
which is a suffix of a larger string is considered a duplicate.  Thus
`"def"' will be merged with `"abcdef"';  A reference to the first
`"def"' will be changed to a reference to `"abcdef"+3'.

   If FLAGS contains the `G' symbol then the TYPE argument must be
present along with an additional field like this:

     .section NAME , "FLAGS"G, @TYPE, GROUPNAME[, LINKAGE]

   The GROUPNAME field specifies the name of the section group to which
this particular section belongs.  The optional linkage field can
contain:
`comdat'
     indicates that only one copy of this section should be retained

`.gnu.linkonce'
     an alias for comdat

   Note: if both the M and G flags are present then the fields for the
Merge flag should come first, like this:

     .section NAME , "FLAGS"MG, @TYPE, ENTSIZE, GROUPNAME[, LINKAGE]

   If FLAGS contains the `?' symbol then it may not also contain the
`G' symbol and the GROUPNAME or LINKAGE fields should not be present.
Instead, `?' says to consider the section that's current before this
directive.  If that section used `G', then the new section will use `G'
with those same GROUPNAME and LINKAGE fields implicitly.  If not, then
the `?' symbol has no effect.

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to have none of the above flags: it will not be allocated
in memory, nor writable, nor executable.  The section will contain data.

   For ELF targets, the assembler supports another type of `.section'
directive for compatibility with the Solaris assembler:

     .section "NAME"[, FLAGS...]

   Note that the section name is quoted.  There may be a sequence of
comma separated flags:
`#alloc'
     section is allocatable

`#write'
     section is writable

`#execinstr'
     section is executable

`#exclude'
     section is excluded from executable and shared library.

`#tls'
     section is used for thread local storage

   This directive replaces the current section and subsection.  See the
contents of the gas testsuite directory `gas/testsuite/gas/elf' for
some examples of how this directive and the other section stack
directives work.

7.100 `.set SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
===============================

Set the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION.  This changes SYMBOL's value and
type to conform to EXPRESSION.  If SYMBOL was flagged as external, it
remains flagged (*note Symbol Attributes::).

   You may `.set' a symbol many times in the same assembly.

   If you `.set' a global symbol, the value stored in the object file
is the last value stored into it.

   On Z80 `set' is a real instruction, use `SYMBOL defl EXPRESSION'
instead.

7.102 `.single FLONUMS'
=======================

7.103 `.size'
=============

This directive is used to set the size associated with a symbol.

COFF Version
------------

   For COFF targets, the `.size' directive is only permitted inside
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.  It is used like this:

     .size EXPRESSION

ELF Version
-----------

   For ELF targets, the `.size' directive is used like this:

     .size NAME , EXPRESSION

   This directive sets the size associated with a symbol NAME.  The
size in bytes is computed from EXPRESSION which can make use of label
arithmetic.  This directive is typically used to set the size of
function symbols.

7.104 `.skip SIZE , FILL'
=========================

This directive emits SIZE bytes, each of value FILL.  Both SIZE and
FILL are absolute expressions.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL
is assumed to be zero.  This is the same as `.space'.


File: as.info,  Node: Sleb128,  Next: Space,  Prev: Skip,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.105 `.sleb128 EXPRESSIONS'
============================

SLEB128 stands for "signed little endian base 128."  This is a compact,
variable length representation of numbers used by the DWARF symbolic
debugging format.  *Note `.uleb128': Uleb128.


File: as.info,  Node: Space,  Next: Stab,  Prev: Sleb128,  Up: Pseudo Ops

This directive emits SIZE bytes, each of value FILL.  Both SIZE and
FILL are absolute expressions.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL
is assumed to be zero.  This is the same as `.skip'.

     _Warning:_ `.space' has a completely different meaning for HPPA
     targets; use `.block' as a substitute.  See `HP9000 Series 800
     Assembly Language Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for the

7.107 `.stabd, .stabn, .stabs'
==============================

There are three directives that begin `.stab'.  All emit symbols (*note
Symbols::), for use by symbolic debuggers.  The symbols are not entered
in the `as' hash table: they cannot be referenced elsewhere in the
source file.  Up to five fields are required:

STRING
     This is the symbol's name.  It may contain any character except
     `\000', so is more general than ordinary symbol names.  Some
     debuggers used to code arbitrarily complex structures into symbol
     names using this field.

TYPE
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's type is set to the low 8
     bits of this expression.  Any bit pattern is permitted, but `ld'
     and debuggers choke on silly bit patterns.

OTHER
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's "other" attribute is set to
     the low 8 bits of this expression.

DESC
     An absolute expression.  The symbol's descriptor is set to the low
     16 bits of this expression.

VALUE
     An absolute expression which becomes the symbol's value.

   If a warning is detected while reading a `.stabd', `.stabn', or
`.stabs' statement, the symbol has probably already been created; you
get a half-formed symbol in your object file.  This is compatible with
earlier assemblers!

`.stabd TYPE , OTHER , DESC'
     The "name" of the symbol generated is not even an empty string.
     It is a null pointer, for compatibility.  Older assemblers used a
     null pointer so they didn't waste space in object files with empty
     strings.

     The symbol's value is set to the location counter, relocatably.
     When your program is linked, the value of this symbol is the
     address of the location counter when the `.stabd' was assembled.

`.stabn TYPE , OTHER , DESC , VALUE'
     The name of the symbol is set to the empty string `""'.

`.stabs STRING ,  TYPE , OTHER , DESC , VALUE'
     All five fields are specified.


File: as.info,  Node: String,  Next: Struct,  Prev: Stab,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.108 `.string' "STR", `.string8' "STR", `.string16'
====================================================

"STR", `.string32' "STR", `.string64' "STR"

   Copy the characters in STR to the object file.  You may specify more
than one string to copy, separated by commas.  Unless otherwise
specified for a particular machine, the assembler marks the end of each
string with a 0 byte.  You can use any of the escape sequences
described in *note Strings: Strings.

   The variants `string16', `string32' and `string64' differ from the
`string' pseudo opcode in that each 8-bit character from STR is copied
and expanded to 16, 32 or 64 bits respectively.  The expanded characters
are stored in target endianness byte order.

   Example:
     	.string32 "BYE"
     expands to:
     	.string   "B\0\0\0Y\0\0\0E\0\0\0"  /* On little endian targets.  */
     	.string   "\0\0\0B\0\0\0Y\0\0\0E"  /* On big endian targets.  */

7.109 `.struct EXPRESSION'
==========================

Switch to the absolute section, and set the section offset to
EXPRESSION, which must be an absolute expression.  You might use this
as follows:
             .struct 0
     field1:
             .struct field1 + 4
     field2:
             .struct field2 + 4
     field3:
   This would define the symbol `field1' to have the value 0, the symbol
`field2' to have the value 4, and the symbol `field3' to have the value
8.  Assembly would be left in the absolute section, and you would need
to use a `.section' directive of some sort to change to some other
section before further assembly.

7.110 `.subsection NAME'
========================

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are `.section' (*note Section::), `.pushsection' (*note
PushSection::), `.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and `.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive replaces the current subsection with `name'.  The
current section is not changed.  The replaced subsection is put onto
the section stack in place of the then current top of stack subsection.


File: as.info,  Node: Symver,  Next: Tag,  Prev: SubSection,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.111 `.symver'
===============

Use the `.symver' directive to bind symbols to specific version nodes
within a source file.  This is only supported on ELF platforms, and is
typically used when assembling files to be linked into a shared library.
There are cases where it may make sense to use this in objects to be
bound into an application itself so as to override a versioned symbol
from a shared library.

   For ELF targets, the `.symver' directive can be used like this:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@NODENAME
   If the symbol NAME is defined within the file being assembled, the
`.symver' directive effectively creates a symbol alias with the name
NAME2@NODENAME, and in fact the main reason that we just don't try and
create a regular alias is that the @ character isn't permitted in
symbol names.  The NAME2 part of the name is the actual name of the
symbol by which it will be externally referenced.  The name NAME itself
is merely a name of convenience that is used so that it is possible to
have definitions for multiple versions of a function within a single
source file, and so that the compiler can unambiguously know which
version of a function is being mentioned.  The NODENAME portion of the
alias should be the name of a node specified in the version script
supplied to the linker when building a shared library.  If you are
attempting to override a versioned symbol from a shared library, then
NODENAME should correspond to the nodename of the symbol you are trying
to override.

   If the symbol NAME is not defined within the file being assembled,
all references to NAME will be changed to NAME2@NODENAME.  If no
reference to NAME is made, NAME2@NODENAME will be removed from the
symbol table.

   Another usage of the `.symver' directive is:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@@NODENAME
   In this case, the symbol NAME must exist and be defined within the
file being assembled. It is similar to NAME2@NODENAME. The difference
is NAME2@@NODENAME will also be used to resolve references to NAME2 by
the linker.

   The third usage of the `.symver' directive is:
     .symver NAME, NAME2@@@NODENAME
   When NAME is not defined within the file being assembled, it is
treated as NAME2@NODENAME. When NAME is defined within the file being

7.115 `.type'
=============

This directive is used to set the type of a symbol.

COFF Version
------------

   For COFF targets, this directive is permitted only within
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.  It is used like this:

     .type INT

   This records the integer INT as the type attribute of a symbol table
entry.

ELF Version
-----------

   For ELF targets, the `.type' directive is used like this:

     .type NAME , TYPE DESCRIPTION

   This sets the type of symbol NAME to be either a function symbol or
an object symbol.  There are five different syntaxes supported for the
TYPE DESCRIPTION field, in order to provide compatibility with various
other assemblers.

   Because some of the characters used in these syntaxes (such as `@'
and `#') are comment characters for some architectures, some of the
syntaxes below do not work on all architectures.  The first variant
will be accepted by the GNU assembler on all architectures so that
variant should be used for maximum portability, if you do not need to
assemble your code with other assemblers.

   The syntaxes supported are:

       .type <name> STT_<TYPE_IN_UPPER_CASE>
       .type <name>,#<type>
       .type <name>,@<type>
       .type <name>,%<type>
       .type <name>,"<type>"

   The types supported are:

`STT_FUNC'
`function'
     Mark the symbol as being a function name.

`STT_GNU_IFUNC'
`gnu_indirect_function'
     Mark the symbol as an indirect function when evaluated during reloc
     processing.  (This is only supported on assemblers targeting GNU
     systems).

`STT_OBJECT'
`object'
     Mark the symbol as being a data object.

`STT_TLS'
`tls_object'
     Mark the symbol as being a thead-local data object.

`STT_COMMON'
`common'
     Mark the symbol as being a common data object.

`STT_NOTYPE'
`notype'
     Does not mark the symbol in any way.  It is supported just for
     completeness.

`gnu_unique_object'
     Marks the symbol as being a globally unique data object.  The
     dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process there is
     just one symbol with this name and type in use.  (This is only
     supported on assemblers targeting GNU systems).


   Note: Some targets support extra types in addition to those listed
above.

7.116 `.uleb128 EXPRESSIONS'
============================

ULEB128 stands for "unsigned little endian base 128."  This is a
compact, variable length representation of numbers used by the DWARF
symbolic debugging format.  *Note `.sleb128': Sleb128.

the address ADDR as the value attribute of a symbol table entry.


File: as.info,  Node: Version,  Next: VTableEntry,  Prev: Val,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.118 `.version "STRING"'
=========================

This directive creates a `.note' section and places into it an ELF
formatted note of type NT_VERSION.  The note's name is set to `string'.


File: as.info,  Node: VTableEntry,  Next: VTableInherit,  Prev: Version,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.119 `.vtable_entry TABLE, OFFSET'
===================================

This directive finds or creates a symbol `table' and creates a
`VTABLE_ENTRY' relocation for it with an addend of `offset'.


File: as.info,  Node: VTableInherit,  Next: Warning,  Prev: VTableEntry,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.120 `.vtable_inherit CHILD, PARENT'
=====================================

This directive finds the symbol `child' and finds or creates the symbol
`parent' and then creates a `VTABLE_INHERIT' relocation for the parent
whose addend is the value of the child symbol.  As a special case the
parent name of `0' is treated as referring to the `*ABS*' section.


File: as.info,  Node: Warning,  Next: Weak,  Prev: VTableInherit,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.121 `.warning "STRING"'
=========================

Similar to the directive `.error' (*note `.error "STRING"': Error.),
but just emits a warning.


File: as.info,  Node: Weak,  Next: Weakref,  Prev: Warning,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.122 `.weak NAMES'
===================

This directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of
symbol `names'.  If the symbols do not already exist, they will be
created.

   On COFF targets other than PE, weak symbols are a GNU extension.
This directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of
symbol `names'.  If the symbols do not already exist, they will be
created.

   On the PE target, weak symbols are supported natively as weak
aliases.  When a weak symbol is created that is not an alias, GAS
creates an alternate symbol to hold the default value.


File: as.info,  Node: Weakref,  Next: Word,  Prev: Weak,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.123 `.weakref ALIAS, TARGET'
==============================

This directive creates an alias to the target symbol that enables the
symbol to be referenced with weak-symbol semantics, but without
actually making it weak.  If direct references or definitions of the
symbol are present, then the symbol will not be weak, but if all
references to it are through weak references, the symbol will be marked
as weak in the symbol table.

   The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a
separate assembly source file, renaming the alias to the symbol in it,
declaring the symbol as weak there, and running a reloadable link to
merge the object files resulting from the assembly of the new source
file and the old source file that had the references to the alias
removed.

   The alias itself never makes to the symbol table, and is entirely
handled within the assembler.


File: as.info,  Node: Word,  Next: Deprecated,  Prev: Weakref,  Up: Pseudo Ops

7.124 `.word EXPRESSIONS'
=========================

This directive expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section,
separated by commas.

   The size of the number emitted, and its byte order, depend on what
target computer the assembly is for.

     _Warning: Special Treatment to support Compilers_

   Machines with a 32-bit address space, but that do less than 32-bit
addressing, require the following special treatment.  If the machine of
interest to you does 32-bit addressing (or doesn't require it; *note
Machine Dependencies::), you can ignore this issue.

   In order to assemble compiler output into something that works, `as'
occasionally does strange things to `.word' directives.  Directives of
the form `.word sym1-sym2' are often emitted by compilers as part of
jump tables.  Therefore, when `as' assembles a directive of the form
`.word sym1-sym2', and the difference between `sym1' and `sym2' does
not fit in 16 bits, `as' creates a "secondary jump table", immediately
before the next label.  This secondary jump table is preceded by a
short-jump to the first byte after the secondary table.  This
short-jump prevents the flow of control from accidentally falling into
the new table.  Inside the table is a long-jump to `sym2'.  The
original `.word' contains `sym1' minus the address of the long-jump to
`sym2'.

   If there were several occurrences of `.word sym1-sym2' before the
secondary jump table, all of them are adjusted.  If there was a `.word
sym3-sym4', that also did not fit in sixteen bits, a long-jump to
`sym4' is included in the secondary jump table, and the `.word'
directives are adjusted to contain `sym3' minus the address of the
long-jump to `sym4'; and so on, for as many entries in the original
jump table as necessary.

8 Object Attributes
*******************

`as' assembles source files written for a specific architecture into
object files for that architecture.  But not all object files are alike.
Many architectures support incompatible variations.  For instance,
floating point arguments might be passed in floating point registers if
the object file requires hardware floating point support--or floating
point arguments might be passed in integer registers if the object file
supports processors with no hardware floating point unit.  Or, if two
objects are built for different generations of the same architecture,
the combination may require the newer generation at run-time.

   This information is useful during and after linking.  At link time,
`ld' can warn about incompatible object files.  After link time, tools
like `gdb' can use it to process the linked file correctly.

   Compatibility information is recorded as a series of object
attributes.  Each attribute has a "vendor", "tag", and "value".  The
vendor is a string, and indicates who sets the meaning of the tag.  The
tag is an integer, and indicates what property the attribute describes.
The value may be a string or an integer, and indicates how the property
affects this object.  Missing attributes are the same as attributes
with a zero value or empty string value.

   Object attributes were developed as part of the ABI for the ARM
Architecture.  The file format is documented in `ELF for the ARM
Architecture'.

File: as.info,  Node: GNU Object Attributes,  Next: Defining New Object Attributes,  Up: Object Attributes

8.1 GNU Object Attributes
=========================

The `.gnu_attribute' directive records an object attribute with vendor
`gnu'.

   Except for `Tag_compatibility', which has both an integer and a
string for its value, GNU attributes have a string value if the tag
number is odd and an integer value if the tag number is even.  The
second bit (`TAG & 2' is set for architecture-independent attributes
and clear for architecture-dependent ones.

8.1.1 Common GNU attributes
---------------------------

These attributes are valid on all architectures.

Tag_compatibility (32)
     The compatibility attribute takes an integer flag value and a
     vendor name.  If the flag value is 0, the file is compatible with
     other toolchains.  If it is 1, then the file is only compatible
     with the named toolchain.  If it is greater than 1, the file can
     only be processed by other toolchains under some private
     arrangement indicated by the flag value and the vendor name.

8.1.2 MIPS Attributes
---------------------

Tag_GNU_MIPS_ABI_FP (4)
     The floating-point ABI used by this object file.  The value will
     be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the floating-point ABI.

        * 1 for files using the hardware floating-point with a standard
          double-precision FPU.

        * 2 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with a
          single-precision FPU.

        * 3 for files using the software floating-point ABI.

        * 4 for files using the hardware floating-point ABI with 64-bit
          wide double-precision floating-point registers and 32-bit
          wide general purpose registers.

8.1.3 PowerPC Attributes
------------------------

Tag_GNU_Power_ABI_FP (4)
     The floating-point ABI used by this object file.  The value will
     be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the floating-point ABI.

        * 1 for files using double-precision hardware floating-point
          ABI.

        * 2 for files using the software floating-point ABI.

        * 3 for files using single-precision hardware floating-point
          ABI.

Tag_GNU_Power_ABI_Vector (8)
     The vector ABI used by this object file.  The value will be:

        * 0 for files not affected by the vector ABI.

        * 1 for files using general purpose registers to pass vectors.

        * 2 for files using AltiVec registers to pass vectors.

        * 3 for files using SPE registers to pass vectors.

8.2 Defining New Object Attributes
==================================

If you want to define a new GNU object attribute, here are the places
you will need to modify.  New attributes should be discussed on the
`binutils' mailing list.

   * This manual, which is the official register of attributes.

   * The header for your architecture `include/elf', to define the tag.

   * The `bfd' support file for your architecture, to merge the
     attribute and issue any appropriate link warnings.

   * Test cases in `ld/testsuite' for merging and link warnings.

   * `binutils/readelf.c' to display your attribute.

   * GCC, if you want the compiler to mark the attribute automatically.

9 Machine Dependent Features
****************************

The machine instruction sets are (almost by definition) different on
each machine where `as' runs.  Floating point representations vary as
well, and `as' often supports a few additional directives or
command-line options for compatibility with other assemblers on a
particular platform.  Finally, some versions of `as' support special
pseudo-instructions for branch optimization.

   This chapter discusses most of these differences, though it does not
include details on any machine's instruction set.  For details on that
subject, see the hardware manufacturer's manual.

9.1.1 Options
-------------

`-EB'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian processor.

`-EL'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a little-endian processor.

`-mabi=ABI'
     Specify which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: `ilp32' and `lp64', which decides the generated object file
     in ELF32 and ELF64 format respectively.  The default is `lp64'.

`-mcpu=PROCESSOR[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The
     following processor names are recognized: `cortex-a53',
     `cortex-a57', and `xgene-1'.  The special name `all' may be used
     to allow the assembler to accept instructions valid for any
     supported processor, including all optional extensions.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be
     told to accept, or restrict, various extension mnemonics that
     extend the processor.  *Note AArch64 Extensions::.

     If some implementations of a particular processor can have an
     extension, then then those extensions are automatically enabled.
     Consequently, you will not normally have to specify any additional
     extensions.

`-march=ARCHITECTURE[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target architecture.  The
     only value for ARCHITECTURE is `armv8-a'.

     If both `-mcpu' and `-march' are specified, the assembler will use
     the setting for `-mcpu'.  If neither are specified, the assembler
     will default to `-mcpu=all'.

     The architecture option can be extended with the same instruction
     set extension options as the `-mcpu' option.  Unlike `-mcpu',
     extensions are not always enabled by default, *Note AArch64
     Extensions::.

`-mverbose-error'
     This option enables verbose error messages for AArch64 gas.  This
     option is enabled by default.

`-mno-verbose-error'
     This option disables verbose error messages in AArch64 gas.

9.1.2 Architecture Extensions
-----------------------------

The table below lists the permitted architecture extensions that are
supported by the assembler and the conditions under which they are
automatically enabled.

   Multiple extensions may be specified, separated by a `+'.  Extension
mnemonics may also be removed from those the assembler accepts.  This
is done by prepending `no' to the option that adds the extension.
Extensions that are removed must be listed after all extensions that
have been added.

   Enabling an extension that requires other extensions will
automatically cause those extensions to be enabled.  Similarly,
disabling an extension that is required by other extensions will
automatically cause those extensions to be disabled.

Extension Minimum      Enabled by   Description

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`crc'     ARMv8-A      No           Enable CRC instructions.
`crypto'  ARMv8-A      No           Enable cryptographic extensions.  This
                                    implies `fp' and `simd'.

9.1.3.3 Relocations
...................

Relocations for `MOVZ' and `MOVK' instructions can be generated by
prefixing the label with `#:abs_g2:' etc.  For example to load the
48-bit absolute address of FOO into x0:

             movz x0, #:abs_g2:foo		// bits 32-47, overflow check
             movk x0, #:abs_g1_nc:foo	// bits 16-31, no overflow check
             movk x0, #:abs_g0_nc:foo	// bits  0-15, no overflow check

   Relocations for `ADRP', and `ADD', `LDR' or `STR' instructions can
be generated by prefixing the label with `:pg_hi21:' and `#:lo12:'
respectively.

   For example to use 33-bit (+/-4GB) pc-relative addressing to load
the address of FOO into x0:

             adrp x0, :pg_hi21:foo
             add  x0, x0, #:lo12:foo

   Or to load the value of FOO into x0:

             adrp x0, :pg_hi21:foo
             ldr  x0, [x0, #:lo12:foo]

   Note that `:pg_hi21:' is optional.

             adrp x0, foo

   is equivalent to

             adrp x0, :pg_hi21:foo

9.1.5 AArch64 Machine Directives
--------------------------------

`.bss'
     This directive switches to the `.bss' section.

`.ltorg'
     This directive causes the current contents of the literal pool to
     be dumped into the current section (which is assumed to be the
     .text section) at the current location (aligned to a word
     boundary).  GAS maintains a separate literal pool for each section
     and each sub-section.  The `.ltorg' directive will only affect the
     literal pool of the current section and sub-section.  At the end
     of assembly all remaining, un-empty literal pools will
     automatically be dumped.

     Note - older versions of GAS would dump the current literal pool
     any time a section change occurred.  This is no longer done, since
     it prevents accurate control of the placement of literal pools.

`.pool'
     This is a synonym for .ltorg.

`NAME .req REGISTER NAME'
     This creates an alias for REGISTER NAME called NAME.  For example:

                  foo .req w0

`.unreq ALIAS-NAME'
     This undefines a register alias which was previously defined using
     the `req' directive.  For example:

                  foo .req w0
                  .unreq foo

     An error occurs if the name is undefined.  Note - this pseudo op
     can be used to delete builtin in register name aliases (eg 'w0').
     This should only be done if it is really necessary.

9.1.6 Opcodes
-------------

GAS implements all the standard AArch64 opcodes.  It also implements
several pseudo opcodes, including several synthetic load instructions.

`LDR ='
            ldr <register> , =<expression>

     The constant expression will be placed into the nearest literal
     pool (if it not already there) and a PC-relative LDR instruction
     will be generated.

language notation, see `ARMv8 Instruction Set Overview' available at

9.1.7 Mapping Symbols
---------------------

The AArch64 ELF specification requires that special symbols be inserted
into object files to mark certain features:

`$x'
     At the start of a region of code containing AArch64 instructions.

`$d'
     At the start of a region of data.

also supports the ECOFF and EVAX formats, but features specific to
these formats are not yet documented.


File: as.info,  Node: Alpha Options,  Next: Alpha Syntax,  Prev: Alpha Notes,  Up: Alpha-Dependent

9.2.2 Options
-------------

`-mCPU'
     This option specifies the target processor.  If an attempt is made
     to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target
     processor, the assembler may either expand the instruction as a
     macro or issue an error message.  This option is equivalent to the
     `.arch' directive.

     The following processor names are recognized: `21064', `21064a',
     `21066', `21068', `21164', `21164a', `21164pc', `21264', `21264a',
     `21264b', `ev4', `ev5', `lca45', `ev5', `ev56', `pca56', `ev6',
     `ev67', `ev68'.  The special name `all' may be used to allow the
     assembler to accept instructions valid for any Alpha processor.

     In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect to
     `.arch', and existing practice within `MILO' (the Linux ARC
     bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable the
     processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the
     "electro-vlasic" names (e.g. `ev4') do not.

`-mdebug'
`-no-mdebug'
     Enables or disables the generation of `.mdebug' encapsulation for
     stabs directives and procedure descriptors.  The default is to
     automatically enable `.mdebug' when the first stabs directive is
     seen.

`-relax'
     This option forces all relocations to be put into the object file,
     instead of saving space and resolving some relocations at assembly
     time.  Note that this option does not propagate all symbol
     arithmetic into the object file, because not all symbol arithmetic
     can be represented.  However, the option can still be useful in
     specific applications.

`-replace'
`-noreplace'
     Enables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both at
     assemblage and at link time.  These options are only available for
     VMS targets and `-replace' is the default.  See section 1.4.1 of
     the OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.

`-g'
     This option is used when the compiler generates debug information.
     When `gcc' is using `mips-tfile' to generate debug information for
     ECOFF, local labels must be passed through to the object file.
     Otherwise this option has no effect.

`-GSIZE'
     A local common symbol larger than SIZE is placed in `.bss', while
     smaller symbols are placed in `.sbss'.

`-F'
`-32addr'
     These options are ignored for backward compatibility.

9.2.3 Syntax
------------

The assembler syntax closely follow the Alpha Reference Manual;
assembler directives and general syntax closely follow the OSF/1 and
OpenVMS syntax, with a few differences for ELF.

File: as.info,  Node: Alpha-Chars,  Next: Alpha-Regs,  Up: Alpha Syntax

9.2.3.1 Special Characters
..........................

`#' is the line comment character.  Note that if `#' is the first
character on a line then it can also be a logical line number directive
(*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   `;' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

9.2.3.2 Register Names
......................

The 32 integer registers are referred to as `$N' or `$rN'.  In
addition, registers 15, 28, 29, and 30 may be referred to by the
symbols `$fp', `$at', `$gp', and `$sp' respectively.

   The 32 floating-point registers are referred to as `$fN'.


File: as.info,  Node: Alpha-Relocs,  Prev: Alpha-Regs,  Up: Alpha Syntax

9.2.3.3 Relocations
...................

Some of these relocations are available for ECOFF, but mostly only for
ELF.  They are modeled after the relocation format introduced in
Digital Unix 4.0, but there are additions.

   The format is `!TAG' or `!TAG!NUMBER' where TAG is the name of the
relocation.  In some cases NUMBER is used to relate specific
instructions.

   The relocation is placed at the end of the instruction like so:

     ldah  $0,a($29)    !gprelhigh
     lda   $0,a($0)     !gprellow
     ldq   $1,b($29)    !literal!100
     ldl   $2,0($1)     !lituse_base!100

`!literal'
`!literal!N'
     Used with an `ldq' instruction to load the address of a symbol
     from the GOT.

     A sequence number N is optional, and if present is used to pair
     `lituse' relocations with this `literal' relocation.  The `lituse'
     relocations are used by the linker to optimize the code based on
     the final location of the symbol.

     Note that these optimizations are dependent on the data flow of the
     program.  Therefore, if _any_ `lituse' is paired with a `literal'
     relocation, then _all_ uses of the register set by the `literal'
     instruction must also be marked with `lituse' relocations.  This
     is because the original `literal' instruction may be deleted or
     transformed into another instruction.

     Also note that there may be a one-to-many relationship between
     `literal' and `lituse', but not a many-to-one.  That is, if there
     are two code paths that load up the same address and feed the
     value to a single use, then the use may not use a `lituse'
     relocation.

`!lituse_base!N'
     Used with any memory format instruction (e.g. `ldl') to indicate
     that the literal is used for an address load.  The offset field of
     the instruction must be zero.  During relaxation, the code may be
     altered to use a gp-relative load.

`!lituse_jsr!N'
     Used with a register branch format instruction (e.g. `jsr') to
     indicate that the literal is used for a call.  During relaxation,
     the code may be altered to use a direct branch (e.g. `bsr').

`!lituse_jsrdirect!N'
     Similar to `lituse_jsr', but also that this call cannot be vectored
     through a PLT entry.  This is useful for functions with special
     calling conventions which do not allow the normal call-clobbered
     registers to be clobbered.

`!lituse_bytoff!N'
     Used with a byte mask instruction (e.g. `extbl') to indicate that
     only the low 3 bits of the address are relevant.  During
     relaxation, the code may be altered to use an immediate instead of
     a register shift.

`!lituse_addr!N'
     Used with any other instruction to indicate that the original
     address is in fact used, and the original `ldq' instruction may
     not be altered or deleted.  This is useful in conjunction with
     `lituse_jsr' to test whether a weak symbol is defined.

          ldq  $27,foo($29)   !literal!1
          beq  $27,is_undef   !lituse_addr!1
          jsr  $26,($27),foo  !lituse_jsr!1

`!lituse_tlsgd!N'
     Used with a register branch format instruction to indicate that the
     literal is the call to `__tls_get_addr' used to compute the
     address of the thread-local storage variable whose descriptor was
     loaded with `!tlsgd!N'.

`!lituse_tlsldm!N'
     Used with a register branch format instruction to indicate that the
     literal is the call to `__tls_get_addr' used to compute the
     address of the base of the thread-local storage block for the
     current module.  The descriptor for the module must have been
     loaded with `!tlsldm!N'.

`!gpdisp!N'
     Used with `ldah' and `lda' to load the GP from the current
     address, a-la the `ldgp' macro.  The source register for the
     `ldah' instruction must contain the address of the `ldah'
     instruction.  There must be exactly one `lda' instruction paired
     with the `ldah' instruction, though it may appear anywhere in the
     instruction stream.  The immediate operands must be zero.

          bsr  $26,foo
          ldah $29,0($26)     !gpdisp!1
          lda  $29,0($29)     !gpdisp!1

`!gprelhigh'
     Used with an `ldah' instruction to add the high 16 bits of a
     32-bit displacement from the GP.

`!gprellow'
     Used with any memory format instruction to add the low 16 bits of a
     32-bit displacement from the GP.

`!gprel'
     Used with any memory format instruction to add a 16-bit
     displacement from the GP.

`!samegp'
     Used with any branch format instruction to skip the GP load at the
     target address.  The referenced symbol must have the same GP as the
     source object file, and it must be declared to either not use `$27'
     or perform a standard GP load in the first two instructions via the
     `.prologue' directive.

`!tlsgd'
`!tlsgd!N'
     Used with an `lda' instruction to load the address of a TLS
     descriptor for a symbol in the GOT.

     The sequence number N is optional, and if present it used to pair
     the descriptor load with both the `literal' loading the address of
     the `__tls_get_addr' function and the `lituse_tlsgd' marking the
     call to that function.

     For proper relaxation, both the `tlsgd', `literal' and `lituse'
     relocations must be in the same extended basic block.  That is,
     the relocation with the lowest address must be executed first at
     runtime.

`!tlsldm'
`!tlsldm!N'
     Used with an `lda' instruction to load the address of a TLS
     descriptor for the current module in the GOT.

     Similar in other respects to `tlsgd'.

`!gotdtprel'
     Used with an `ldq' instruction to load the offset of the TLS
     symbol within its module's thread-local storage block.  Also known
     as the dynamic thread pointer offset or dtp-relative offset.

`!dtprelhi'
`!dtprello'
`!dtprel'
     Like `gprel' relocations except they compute dtp-relative offsets.

`!gottprel'
     Used with an `ldq' instruction to load the offset of the TLS
     symbol from the thread pointer.  Also known as the tp-relative
     offset.

`!tprelhi'
`!tprello'
`!tprel'
     Like `gprel' relocations except they compute tp-relative offsets.

9.2.5 Alpha Assembler Directives
--------------------------------

`as' for the Alpha supports many additional directives for
compatibility with the native assembler.  This section describes them
only briefly.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the Alpha:

`.arch CPU'
     Specifies the target processor.  This is equivalent to the `-mCPU'
     command-line option.  *Note Options: Alpha Options, for a list of
     values for CPU.

`.ent FUNCTION[, N]'
     Mark the beginning of FUNCTION.  An optional number may follow for
     compatibility with the OSF/1 assembler, but is ignored.  When
     generating `.mdebug' information, this will create a procedure
     descriptor for the function.  In ELF, it will mark the symbol as a
     function a-la the generic `.type' directive.

`.end FUNCTION'
     Mark the end of FUNCTION.  In ELF, it will set the size of the
     symbol a-la the generic `.size' directive.

`.mask MASK, OFFSET'
     Indicate which of the integer registers are saved in the current
     function's stack frame.  MASK is interpreted a bit mask in which
     bit N set indicates that register N is saved.  The registers are
     saved in a block located OFFSET bytes from the "canonical frame
     address" (CFA) which is the value of the stack pointer on entry to
     the function.  The registers are saved sequentially, except that
     the return address register (normally `$26') is saved first.

     This and the other directives that describe the stack frame are
     currently only used when generating `.mdebug' information.  They
     may in the future be used to generate DWARF2 `.debug_frame' unwind
     information for hand written assembly.

`.fmask MASK, OFFSET'
     Indicate which of the floating-point registers are saved in the
     current stack frame.  The MASK and OFFSET parameters are
     interpreted as with `.mask'.

`.frame FRAMEREG, FRAMEOFFSET, RETREG[, ARGOFFSET]'
     Describes the shape of the stack frame.  The frame pointer in use
     is FRAMEREG; normally this is either `$fp' or `$sp'.  The frame
     pointer is FRAMEOFFSET bytes below the CFA.  The return address is
     initially located in RETREG until it is saved as indicated in
     `.mask'.  For compatibility with OSF/1 an optional ARGOFFSET
     parameter is accepted and ignored.  It is believed to indicate the
     offset from the CFA to the saved argument registers.

`.prologue N'
     Indicate that the stack frame is set up and all registers have been
     spilled.  The argument N indicates whether and how the function
     uses the incoming "procedure vector" (the address of the called
     function) in `$27'.  0 indicates that `$27' is not used; 1
     indicates that the first two instructions of the function use `$27'
     to perform a load of the GP register; 2 indicates that `$27' is
     used in some non-standard way and so the linker cannot elide the
     load of the procedure vector during relaxation.

`.usepv FUNCTION, WHICH'
     Used to indicate the use of the `$27' register, similar to
     `.prologue', but without the other semantics of needing to be
     inside an open `.ent'/`.end' block.

     The WHICH argument should be either `no', indicating that `$27' is
     not used, or `std', indicating that the first two instructions of
     the function perform a GP load.

     One might use this directive instead of `.prologue' if you are
     also using dwarf2 CFI directives.

`.gprel32 EXPRESSION'
     Computes the difference between the address in EXPRESSION and the
     GP for the current object file, and stores it in 4 bytes.  In
     addition to being smaller than a full 8 byte address, this also
     does not require a dynamic relocation when used in a shared
     library.

`.t_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as an IEEE double precision value.

`.s_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as an IEEE single precision value.

`.f_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as a VAX F format value.

`.g_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as a VAX G format value.

`.d_floating EXPRESSION'
     Stores EXPRESSION as a VAX D format value.

`.set FEATURE'
     Enables or disables various assembler features.  Using the positive
     name of the feature enables while using `noFEATURE' disables.

    `at'
          Indicates that macro expansions may clobber the "assembler
          temporary" (`$at' or `$28') register.  Some macros may not be
          expanded without this and will generate an error message if
          `noat' is in effect.  When `at' is in effect, a warning will
          be generated if `$at' is used by the programmer.

    `macro'
          Enables the expansion of macro instructions.  Note that
          variants of real instructions, such as `br label' vs `br
          $31,label' are considered alternate forms and not macros.

    `move'
    `reorder'
    `volatile'
          These control whether and how the assembler may re-order
          instructions.  Accepted for compatibility with the OSF/1
          assembler, but `as' does not do instruction scheduling, so
          these features are ignored.

   The following directives are recognized for compatibility with the
OSF/1 assembler but are ignored.

     .proc           .aproc
     .reguse         .livereg
     .option         .aent
     .ugen           .eflag
     .alias          .noalias

The ARC version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.2byte EXPRESSIONS'
     *TODO*

`.3byte EXPRESSIONS'
     *TODO*

`.4byte EXPRESSIONS'
     *TODO*

`.extAuxRegister NAME,ADDRESS,MODE'
     The ARCtangent A4 has extensible auxiliary register space.  The
     auxiliary registers can be defined in the assembler source code by
     using this directive.  The first parameter is the NAME of the new
     auxiallry register.  The second parameter is the ADDRESS of the
     register in the auxiliary register memory map for the variant of
     the ARC.  The third parameter specifies the MODE in which the
     register can be operated is and it can be one of:

    `r          (readonly)'

    `w          (write only)'

    `r|w        (read or write)'

     For example:

            .extAuxRegister mulhi,0x12,w

     This specifies an extension auxiliary register called _mulhi_
     which is at address 0x12 in the memory space and which is only
     writable.

`.extCondCode SUFFIX,VALUE'
     The condition codes on the ARCtangent A4 are extensible and can be
     specified by means of this assembler directive.  They are specified
     by the suffix and the value for the condition code.  They can be
     used to specify extra condition codes with any values.  For
     example:

            .extCondCode is_busy,0x14

             add.is_busy  r1,r2,r3
             bis_busy     _main

`.extCoreRegister NAME,REGNUM,MODE,SHORTCUT'
     Specifies an extension core register NAME for the application.
     This allows a register NAME with a valid REGNUM between 0 and 60,
     with the following as valid values for MODE

    `_r_   (readonly)'

    `_w_   (write only)'

    `_r|w_ (read or write)'

     The other parameter gives a description of the register having a
     SHORTCUT in the pipeline.  The valid values are:

    `can_shortcut'

    `cannot_shortcut'

     For example:

            .extCoreRegister mlo,57,r,can_shortcut

     This defines an extension core register mlo with the value 57 which
     can shortcut the pipeline.

`.extInstruction NAME,OPCODE,SUBOPCODE,SUFFIXCLASS,SYNTAXCLASS'
     The ARCtangent A4 allows the user to specify extension
     instructions.  The extension instructions are not macros.  The
     assembler creates encodings for use of these instructions
     according to the specification by the user.  The parameters are:

        * NAME Name of the extension instruction

        * OPCODE Opcode to be used. (Bits 27:31 in the encoding).
          Valid values 0x10-0x1f or 0x03

        * SUBOPCODE Subopcode to be used.  Valid values are from
          0x09-0x3f.  However the correct value also depends on
          SYNTAXCLASS

        * SUFFIXCLASS Determines the kinds of suffixes to be allowed.
          Valid values are `SUFFIX_NONE', `SUFFIX_COND', `SUFFIX_FLAG'
          which indicates the absence or presence of conditional
          suffixes and flag setting by the extension instruction.  It
          is also possible to specify that an instruction sets the
          flags and is conditional by using `SUFFIX_CODE' |
          `SUFFIX_FLAG'.

        * SYNTAXCLASS Determines the syntax class for the instruction.
          It can have the following values:

         ``SYNTAX_2OP':'
               2 Operand Instruction

         ``SYNTAX_3OP':'
               3 Operand Instruction

          In addition there could be modifiers for the syntax class as
          described below:

               Syntax Class Modifiers are:

             - `OP1_MUST_BE_IMM': Modifies syntax class SYNTAX_3OP,
               specifying that the first operand of a three-operand
               instruction must be an immediate (i.e., the result is
               discarded).  OP1_MUST_BE_IMM is used by bitwise ORing it
               with SYNTAX_3OP as given in the example below.  This
               could usually be used to set the flags using specific
               instructions and not retain results.

             - `OP1_IMM_IMPLIED': Modifies syntax class SYNTAX_20P, it
               specifies that there is an implied immediate destination
               operand which does not appear in the syntax.  For
               example, if the source code contains an instruction like:

                    inst r1,r2

               it really means that the first argument is an implied
               immediate (that is, the result is discarded).  This is
               the same as though the source code were: inst 0,r1,r2.
               You use OP1_IMM_IMPLIED by bitwise ORing it with
               SYNTAX_20P.


     For example, defining 64-bit multiplier with immediate operands:

          .extInstruction mp64,0x14,0x0,SUFFIX_COND | SUFFIX_FLAG ,
                          SYNTAX_3OP|OP1_MUST_BE_IMM

     The above specifies an extension instruction called mp64 which has
     3 operands, sets the flags, can be used with a condition code, for
     which the first operand is an immediate.  (Equivalent to
     discarding the result of the operation).

           .extInstruction mul64,0x14,0x00,SUFFIX_COND, SYNTAX_2OP|OP1_IMM_IMPLIED

     This describes a 2 operand instruction with an implicit first
     immediate operand.  The result of this operation would be
     discarded.

9.4.1 Options
-------------

`-mcpu=PROCESSOR[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The
     following processor names are recognized: `arm1', `arm2', `arm250',
     `arm3', `arm6', `arm60', `arm600', `arm610', `arm620', `arm7',
     `arm7m', `arm7d', `arm7dm', `arm7di', `arm7dmi', `arm70', `arm700',
     `arm700i', `arm710', `arm710t', `arm720', `arm720t', `arm740t',
     `arm710c', `arm7100', `arm7500', `arm7500fe', `arm7t', `arm7tdmi',
     `arm7tdmi-s', `arm8', `arm810', `strongarm', `strongarm1',
     `strongarm110', `strongarm1100', `strongarm1110', `arm9', `arm920',
     `arm920t', `arm922t', `arm940t', `arm9tdmi', `fa526' (Faraday
     FA526 processor), `fa626' (Faraday FA626 processor), `arm9e',
     `arm926e', `arm926ej-s', `arm946e-r0', `arm946e', `arm946e-s',
     `arm966e-r0', `arm966e', `arm966e-s', `arm968e-s', `arm10t',
     `arm10tdmi', `arm10e', `arm1020', `arm1020t', `arm1020e',
     `arm1022e', `arm1026ej-s', `fa606te' (Faraday FA606TE processor),
     `fa616te' (Faraday FA616TE processor), `fa626te' (Faraday FA626TE
     processor), `fmp626' (Faraday FMP626 processor), `fa726te'
     (Faraday FA726TE processor), `arm1136j-s', `arm1136jf-s',
     `arm1156t2-s', `arm1156t2f-s', `arm1176jz-s', `arm1176jzf-s',
     `mpcore', `mpcorenovfp', `cortex-a5', `cortex-a7', `cortex-a8',
     `cortex-a9', `cortex-a15', `cortex-r4', `cortex-r4f', `cortex-r5',
     `cortex-r7', `cortex-m4', `cortex-m3', `cortex-m1', `cortex-m0',
     `cortex-m0plus', `ep9312' (ARM920 with Cirrus Maverick
     coprocessor), `i80200' (Intel XScale processor) `iwmmxt' (Intel(r)
     XScale processor with Wireless MMX(tm) technology coprocessor) and
     `xscale'.  The special name `all' may be used to allow the
     assembler to accept instructions valid for any ARM processor.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be
     told to accept various extension mnemonics that extend the
     processor using the co-processor instruction space.  For example,
     `-mcpu=arm920+maverick' is equivalent to specifying `-mcpu=ep9312'.

     Multiple extensions may be specified, separated by a `+'.  The
     extensions should be specified in ascending alphabetical order.

     Some extensions may be restricted to particular architectures;
     this is documented in the list of extensions below.

     Extension mnemonics may also be removed from those the assembler
     accepts.  This is done be prepending `no' to the option that adds
     the extension.  Extensions that are removed should be listed after
     all extensions which have been added, again in ascending
     alphabetical order.  For example, `-mcpu=ep9312+nomaverick' is
     equivalent to specifying `-mcpu=arm920'.

     The following extensions are currently supported: `crypto'
     (Cryptography Extensions for v8-A architecture, implies `fp+simd'),
     `fp' (Floating Point Extensions for v8-A architecture), `idiv'
     (Integer Divide Extensions for v7-A and v7-R architectures),
     `iwmmxt', `iwmmxt2', `maverick', `mp' (Multiprocessing Extensions
     for v7-A and v7-R architectures), `os' (Operating System for v6M
     architecture), `sec' (Security Extensions for v6K and v7-A
     architectures), `simd' (Advanced SIMD Extensions for v8-A
     architecture, implies `fp'), `virt' (Virtualization Extensions for
     v7-A architecture, implies `idiv'), and `xscale'.

`-march=ARCHITECTURE[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target architecture.
     The following architecture names are recognized: `armv1', `armv2',
     `armv2a', `armv2s', `armv3', `armv3m', `armv4', `armv4xm',
     `armv4t', `armv4txm', `armv5', `armv5t', `armv5txm', `armv5te',
     `armv5texp', `armv6', `armv6j', `armv6k', `armv6z', `armv6zk',
     `armv6-m', `armv6s-m', `armv7', `armv7-a', `armv7ve', `armv7-r',
     `armv7-m', `armv7e-m', `armv8-a', `iwmmxt' and `xscale'.  If both
     `-mcpu' and `-march' are specified, the assembler will use the
     setting for `-mcpu'.

     The architecture option can be extended with the same instruction
     set extension options as the `-mcpu' option.

`-mfpu=FLOATING-POINT-FORMAT'
     This option specifies the floating point format to assemble for.
     The assembler will issue an error message if an attempt is made to
     assemble an instruction which will not execute on the target
     floating point unit.  The following format options are recognized:
     `softfpa', `fpe', `fpe2', `fpe3', `fpa', `fpa10', `fpa11',
     `arm7500fe', `softvfp', `softvfp+vfp', `vfp', `vfp10', `vfp10-r0',
     `vfp9', `vfpxd', `vfpv2', `vfpv3', `vfpv3-fp16', `vfpv3-d16',
     `vfpv3-d16-fp16', `vfpv3xd', `vfpv3xd-d16', `vfpv4', `vfpv4-d16',
     `fpv4-sp-d16', `fp-armv8', `arm1020t', `arm1020e', `arm1136jf-s',
     `maverick', `neon', `neon-vfpv4', `neon-fp-armv8', and
     `crypto-neon-fp-armv8'.

     In addition to determining which instructions are assembled, this
     option also affects the way in which the `.double' assembler
     directive behaves when assembling little-endian code.

     The default is dependent on the processor selected.  For
     Architecture 5 or later, the default is to assembler for VFP
     instructions; for earlier architectures the default is to assemble
     for FPA instructions.

`-mthumb'
     This option specifies that the assembler should start assembling
     Thumb instructions; that is, it should behave as though the file
     starts with a `.code 16' directive.

`-mthumb-interwork'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as supporting interworking.

`-mimplicit-it=never'
`-mimplicit-it=always'
`-mimplicit-it=arm'
`-mimplicit-it=thumb'
     The `-mimplicit-it' option controls the behavior of the assembler
     when conditional instructions are not enclosed in IT blocks.
     There are four possible behaviors.  If `never' is specified, such
     constructs cause a warning in ARM code and an error in Thumb-2
     code.  If `always' is specified, such constructs are accepted in
     both ARM and Thumb-2 code, where the IT instruction is added
     implicitly.  If `arm' is specified, such constructs are accepted
     in ARM code and cause an error in Thumb-2 code.  If `thumb' is
     specified, such constructs cause a warning in ARM code and are
     accepted in Thumb-2 code.  If you omit this option, the behavior
     is equivalent to `-mimplicit-it=arm'.

`-mapcs-26'
`-mapcs-32'
     These options specify that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as supporting the indicated version of the Arm
     Procedure.  Calling Standard.

`-matpcs'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as supporting the Arm/Thumb Procedure Calling
     Standard.  If enabled this option will cause the assembler to
     create an empty debugging section in the object file called
     .arm.atpcs.  Debuggers can use this to determine the ABI being
     used by.

`-mapcs-float'
     This indicates the floating point variant of the APCS should be
     used.  In this variant floating point arguments are passed in FP
     registers rather than integer registers.

`-mapcs-reentrant'
     This indicates that the reentrant variant of the APCS should be
     used.  This variant supports position independent code.

`-mfloat-abi=ABI'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as using specified floating point ABI.  The
     following values are recognized: `soft', `softfp' and `hard'.

`-meabi=VER'
     This option specifies which EABI version the produced object files
     should conform to.  The following values are recognized: `gnu', `4'
     and `5'.

`-EB'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian processor.

`-EL'
     This option specifies that the output generated by the assembler
     should be marked as being encoded for a little-endian processor.

`-k'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

`--fix-v4bx'
     Allow `BX' instructions in ARMv4 code.  This is intended for use
     with the linker option of the same name.

`-mwarn-deprecated'
`-mno-warn-deprecated'
     Enable or disable warnings about using deprecated options or
     features.  The default is to warn.

`-mccs'
     Turns on CodeComposer Studio assembly syntax compatibility mode.

9.4.2.1 Instruction Set Syntax
..............................

Two slightly different syntaxes are support for ARM and THUMB
instructions.  The default, `divided', uses the old style where ARM and
THUMB instructions had their own, separate syntaxes.  The new,
`unified' syntax, which can be selected via the `.syntax' directive,
and has the following main features:

   * Immediate operands do not require a `#' prefix.

   * The `IT' instruction may appear, and if it does it is validated
     against subsequent conditional affixes.  In ARM mode it does not
     generate machine code, in THUMB mode it does.

   * For ARM instructions the conditional affixes always appear at the
     end of the instruction.  For THUMB instructions conditional
     affixes can be used, but only inside the scope of an `IT'
     instruction.

   * All of the instructions new to the V6T2 architecture (and later)
     are available.  (Only a few such instructions can be written in the
     `divided' syntax).

   * The `.N' and `.W' suffixes are recognized and honored.

   * All instructions set the flags if and only if they have an `s'
     affix.

9.4.2.2 Special Characters
..........................

The presence of a `@' anywhere on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

   Either `#' or `$' can be used to indicate immediate operands.

File: as.info,  Node: ARM-Relocations,  Next: ARM-Neon-Alignment,  Prev: ARM-Regs,  Up: ARM Syntax

9.4.2.4 ARM relocation generation
.................................

Specific data relocations can be generated by putting the relocation
name in parentheses after the symbol name.  For example:

             .word foo(TARGET1)

   This will generate an `R_ARM_TARGET1' relocation against the symbol
FOO.  The following relocations are supported: `GOT', `GOTOFF',
`TARGET1', `TARGET2', `SBREL', `TLSGD', `TLSLDM', `TLSLDO', `TLSDESC',
`TLSCALL', `GOTTPOFF', `GOT_PREL' and `TPOFF'.

   For compatibility with older toolchains the assembler also accepts
`(PLT)' after branch targets.  On legacy targets this will generate the
deprecated `R_ARM_PLT32' relocation.  On EABI targets it will encode
either the `R_ARM_CALL' or `R_ARM_JUMP24' relocation, as appropriate.

   Relocations for `MOVW' and `MOVT' instructions can be generated by
prefixing the value with `#:lower16:' and `#:upper16' respectively.
For example to load the 32-bit address of foo into r0:

             MOVW r0, #:lower16:foo
             MOVT r0, #:upper16:foo

9.4.2.5 NEON Alignment Specifiers
.................................

Some NEON load/store instructions allow an optional address alignment
qualifier.  The ARM documentation specifies that this is indicated by
`@ ALIGN'. However GAS already interprets the `@' character as a "line
comment" start, so `: ALIGN' is used instead.  For example:

             vld1.8 {q0}, [r0, :128]

File: as.info,  Node: ARM Directives,  Next: ARM Opcodes,  Prev: ARM Floating Point,  Up: ARM-Dependent

9.4.4 ARM Machine Directives
----------------------------

`.2byte EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
`.4byte EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
`.8byte EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     These directives write 2, 4 or 8 byte values to the output section.

`.align EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]'
     This is the generic .ALIGN directive.  For the ARM however if the
     first argument is zero (ie no alignment is needed) the assembler
     will behave as if the argument had been 2 (ie pad to the next four
     byte boundary).  This is for compatibility with ARM's own
     assembler.

`.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture.  Valid values for NAME are the
     same as for the `-march' commandline option.

     Specifying `.arch' clears any previously selected architecture
     extensions.

`.arch_extension NAME'
     Add or remove an architecture extension to the target
     architecture.  Valid values for NAME are the same as those
     accepted as architectural extensions by the `-mcpu' commandline
     option.

     `.arch_extension' may be used multiple times to add or remove
     extensions incrementally to the architecture being compiled for.

`.arm'
     This performs the same action as .CODE 32.

`.bss'
     This directive switches to the `.bss' section.

`.cantunwind'
     Prevents unwinding through the current function.  No personality
     routine or exception table data is required or permitted.

`.code `[16|32]''
     This directive selects the instruction set being generated. The
     value 16 selects Thumb, with the value 32 selecting ARM.

`.cpu NAME'
     Select the target processor.  Valid values for NAME are the same as
     for the `-mcpu' commandline option.

     Specifying `.cpu' clears any previously selected architecture
     extensions.

`NAME .dn REGISTER NAME [.TYPE] [[INDEX]]'
`NAME .qn REGISTER NAME [.TYPE] [[INDEX]]'
     The `dn' and `qn' directives are used to create typed and/or
     indexed register aliases for use in Advanced SIMD Extension (Neon)
     instructions.  The former should be used to create aliases of
     double-precision registers, and the latter to create aliases of
     quad-precision registers.

     If these directives are used to create typed aliases, those
     aliases can be used in Neon instructions instead of writing types
     after the mnemonic or after each operand.  For example:

                  x .dn d2.f32
                  y .dn d3.f32
                  z .dn d4.f32[1]
                  vmul x,y,z

     This is equivalent to writing the following:

                  vmul.f32 d2,d3,d4[1]

     Aliases created using `dn' or `qn' can be destroyed using `unreq'.

`.eabi_attribute TAG, VALUE'
     Set the EABI object attribute TAG to VALUE.

     The TAG is either an attribute number, or one of the following:
     `Tag_CPU_raw_name', `Tag_CPU_name', `Tag_CPU_arch',
     `Tag_CPU_arch_profile', `Tag_ARM_ISA_use', `Tag_THUMB_ISA_use',

`.even'
     This directive aligns to an even-numbered address.

`.extend  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
`.ldouble  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     These directives write 12byte long double floating-point values to
     the output section.  These are not compatible with current ARM
     processors or ABIs.

`.fnend'
     Marks the end of a function with an unwind table entry.  The
     unwind index table entry is created when this directive is
     processed.

     If no personality routine has been specified then standard
     personality routine 0 or 1 will be used, depending on the number
     of unwind opcodes required.

`.fnstart'
     Marks the start of a function with an unwind table entry.

`.force_thumb'
     This directive forces the selection of Thumb instructions, even if
     the target processor does not support those instructions

`.fpu NAME'
     Select the floating-point unit to assemble for.  Valid values for
     NAME are the same as for the `-mfpu' commandline option.

`.handlerdata'
     Marks the end of the current function, and the start of the
     exception table entry for that function.  Anything between this
     directive and the `.fnend' directive will be added to the
     exception table entry.

     Must be preceded by a `.personality' or `.personalityindex'
     directive.

`.inst OPCODE [ , ... ]'
`.inst.n OPCODE [ , ... ]'
`.inst.w OPCODE [ , ... ]'
     Generates the instruction corresponding to the numerical value
     OPCODE.  `.inst.n' and `.inst.w' allow the Thumb instruction size
     to be specified explicitly, overriding the normal encoding rules.

`.ldouble  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     See `.extend'.

`.ltorg'
     This directive causes the current contents of the literal pool to
     be dumped into the current section (which is assumed to be the
     .text section) at the current location (aligned to a word
     boundary).  `GAS' maintains a separate literal pool for each
     section and each sub-section.  The `.ltorg' directive will only
     affect the literal pool of the current section and sub-section.
     At the end of assembly all remaining, un-empty literal pools will
     automatically be dumped.

     Note - older versions of `GAS' would dump the current literal pool
     any time a section change occurred.  This is no longer done, since
     it prevents accurate control of the placement of literal pools.

`.movsp REG [, #OFFSET]'
     Tell the unwinder that REG contains an offset from the current
     stack pointer.  If OFFSET is not specified then it is assumed to be
     zero.

`.object_arch NAME'
     Override the architecture recorded in the EABI object attribute
     section.  Valid values for NAME are the same as for the `.arch'
     directive.  Typically this is useful when code uses runtime
     detection of CPU features.

`.packed  EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     This directive writes 12-byte packed floating-point values to the
     output section.  These are not compatible with current ARM
     processors or ABIs.

`.pad #COUNT'
     Generate unwinder annotations for a stack adjustment of COUNT
     bytes.  A positive value indicates the function prologue allocated
     stack space by decrementing the stack pointer.

`.personality NAME'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to NAME.

`.personalityindex INDEX'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to the EABI
     standard routine number INDEX

`.pool'
     This is a synonym for .ltorg.

`NAME .req REGISTER NAME'
     This creates an alias for REGISTER NAME called NAME.  For example:

                  foo .req r0

`.save REGLIST'
     Generate unwinder annotations to restore the registers in REGLIST.
     The format of REGLIST is the same as the corresponding
     store-multiple instruction.

     _core registers_
            .save {r4, r5, r6, lr}
            stmfd sp!, {r4, r5, r6, lr}
     _FPA registers_
            .save f4, 2
            sfmfd f4, 2, [sp]!
     _VFP registers_
            .save {d8, d9, d10}
            fstmdx sp!, {d8, d9, d10}
     _iWMMXt registers_
            .save {wr10, wr11}
            wstrd wr11, [sp, #-8]!
            wstrd wr10, [sp, #-8]!
          or
            .save wr11
            wstrd wr11, [sp, #-8]!
            .save wr10
            wstrd wr10, [sp, #-8]!

`.setfp FPREG, SPREG [, #OFFSET]'
     Make all unwinder annotations relative to a frame pointer.
     Without this the unwinder will use offsets from the stack pointer.

     The syntax of this directive is the same as the `add' or `mov'
     instruction used to set the frame pointer.  SPREG must be either
     `sp' or mentioned in a previous `.movsp' directive.

          .movsp ip
          mov ip, sp
          ...
          .setfp fp, ip, #4
          add fp, ip, #4

`.secrel32 EXPRESSION [, EXPRESSION]*'
     This directive emits relocations that evaluate to the
     section-relative offset of each expression's symbol.  This
     directive is only supported for PE targets.

`.syntax [`unified' | `divided']'
     This directive sets the Instruction Set Syntax as described in the
     *note ARM-Instruction-Set:: section.

`.thumb'
     This performs the same action as .CODE 16.

`.thumb_func'
     This directive specifies that the following symbol is the name of a
     Thumb encoded function.  This information is necessary in order to
     allow the assembler and linker to generate correct code for
     interworking between Arm and Thumb instructions and should be used
     even if interworking is not going to be performed.  The presence
     of this directive also implies `.thumb'

     This directive is not neccessary when generating EABI objects.  On
     these targets the encoding is implicit when generating Thumb code.

`.thumb_set'
     This performs the equivalent of a `.set' directive in that it
     creates a symbol which is an alias for another symbol (possibly
     not yet defined).  This directive also has the added property in
     that it marks the aliased symbol as being a thumb function entry
     point, in the same way that the `.thumb_func' directive does.

`.tlsdescseq TLS-VARIABLE'
     This directive is used to annotate parts of an inlined TLS
     descriptor trampoline.  Normally the trampoline is provided by the
     linker, and this directive is not needed.

`.unreq ALIAS-NAME'
     This undefines a register alias which was previously defined using
     the `req', `dn' or `qn' directives.  For example:

                  foo .req r0
                  .unreq foo

     An error occurs if the name is undefined.  Note - this pseudo op
     can be used to delete builtin in register name aliases (eg 'r0').
     This should only be done if it is really necessary.

`.unwind_raw OFFSET, BYTE1, ...'
     Insert one of more arbitary unwind opcode bytes, which are known
     to adjust the stack pointer by OFFSET bytes.

     For example `.unwind_raw 4, 0xb1, 0x01' is equivalent to `.save
     {r0}'

`.vsave VFP-REGLIST'
     Generate unwinder annotations to restore the VFP registers in
     VFP-REGLIST using FLDMD.  Also works for VFPv3 registers that are
     to be restored using VLDM.  The format of VFP-REGLIST is the same
     as the corresponding store-multiple instruction.

     _VFP registers_
            .vsave {d8, d9, d10}
            fstmdd sp!, {d8, d9, d10}
     _VFPv3 registers_
            .vsave {d15, d16, d17}
            vstm sp!, {d15, d16, d17}

     Since FLDMX and FSTMX are now deprecated, this directive should be
     used in favour of `.save' for saving VFP registers for ARMv6 and
     above.

9.4.5 Opcodes
-------------

`as' implements all the standard ARM opcodes.  It also implements
several pseudo opcodes, including several synthetic load instructions.

`NOP'
            nop

     This pseudo op will always evaluate to a legal ARM instruction
     that does nothing.  Currently it will evaluate to MOV r0, r0.

`LDR'
            ldr <register> , = <expression>

     If expression evaluates to a numeric constant then a MOV or MVN
     instruction will be used in place of the LDR instruction, if the
     constant can be generated by either of these instructions.
     Otherwise the constant will be placed into the nearest literal
     pool (if it not already there) and a PC relative LDR instruction
     will be generated.

`ADR'
            adr <register> <label>

     This instruction will load the address of LABEL into the indicated
     register.  The instruction will evaluate to a PC relative ADD or
     SUB instruction depending upon where the label is located.  If the
     label is out of range, or if it is not defined in the same file
     (and section) as the ADR instruction, then an error will be
     generated.  This instruction will not make use of the literal pool.

`ADRL'
            adrl <register> <label>

     This instruction will load the address of LABEL into the indicated
     register.  The instruction will evaluate to one or two PC relative
     ADD or SUB instructions depending upon where the label is located.
     If a second instruction is not needed a NOP instruction will be
     generated in its place, so that this instruction is always 8 bytes
     long.

     If the label is out of range, or if it is not defined in the same
     file (and section) as the ADRL instruction, then an error will be
     generated.  This instruction will not make use of the literal pool.

9.4.6 Mapping Symbols
---------------------

The ARM ELF specification requires that special symbols be inserted
into object files to mark certain features:

`$a'
     At the start of a region of code containing ARM instructions.

`$t'
     At the start of a region of code containing THUMB instructions.

`$d'
     At the start of a region of data.


   The assembler will automatically insert these symbols for you - there
is no need to code them yourself.  Support for tagging symbols ($b, $f,
$p and $m) which is also mentioned in the current ARM ELF specification
is not implemented.  This is because they have been dropped from the
new EABI and so tools cannot rely upon their presence.


File: as.info,  Node: ARM Unwinding Tutorial,  Prev: ARM Mapping Symbols,  Up: ARM-Dependent

9.4.7 Unwinding
---------------

The ABI for the ARM Architecture specifies a standard format for
exception unwind information.  This information is used when an
exception is thrown to determine where control should be transferred.
In particular, the unwind information is used to determine which
function called the function that threw the exception, and which
function called that one, and so forth.  This information is also used
to restore the values of callee-saved registers in the function
catching the exception.

   If you are writing functions in assembly code, and those functions
call other functions that throw exceptions, you must use assembly
pseudo ops to ensure that appropriate exception unwind information is
generated.  Otherwise, if one of the functions called by your assembly
code throws an exception, the run-time library will be unable to unwind
the stack through your assembly code and your program will not behave
correctly.

   To illustrate the use of these pseudo ops, we will examine the code
that G++ generates for the following C++ input:

void callee (int *);

int
caller ()
{
  int i;
  callee (&i);
  return i;
}

   This example does not show how to throw or catch an exception from
assembly code.  That is a much more complex operation and should always
be done in a high-level language, such as C++, that directly supports
exceptions.

   The code generated by one particular version of G++ when compiling
the example above is:

_Z6callerv:
	.fnstart
.LFB2:
	@ Function supports interworking.
	@ args = 0, pretend = 0, frame = 8
	@ frame_needed = 1, uses_anonymous_args = 0
	stmfd	sp!, {fp, lr}
	.save {fp, lr}
.LCFI0:
	.setfp fp, sp, #4
	add	fp, sp, #4
.LCFI1:
	.pad #8
	sub	sp, sp, #8
.LCFI2:
	sub	r3, fp, #8
	mov	r0, r3
	bl	_Z6calleePi
	ldr	r3, [fp, #-8]
	mov	r0, r3
	sub	sp, fp, #4
	ldmfd	sp!, {fp, lr}
	bx	lr
.LFE2:
	.fnend

   Of course, the sequence of instructions varies based on the options
you pass to GCC and on the version of GCC in use.  The exact
instructions are not important since we are focusing on the pseudo ops
that are used to generate unwind information.

   An important assumption made by the unwinder is that the stack frame
does not change during the body of the function.  In particular, since
we assume that the assembly code does not itself throw an exception,
the only point where an exception can be thrown is from a call, such as
the `bl' instruction above.  At each call site, the same saved
registers (including `lr', which indicates the return address) must be
located in the same locations relative to the frame pointer.

   The `.fnstart' (*note .fnstart pseudo op: arm_fnstart.) pseudo op
appears immediately before the first instruction of the function while
the `.fnend' (*note .fnend pseudo op: arm_fnend.) pseudo op appears
immediately after the last instruction of the function.  These pseudo
ops specify the range of the function.

   Only the order of the other pseudos ops (e.g., `.setfp' or `.pad')
matters; their exact locations are irrelevant.  In the example above,
the compiler emits the pseudo ops with particular instructions.  That
makes it easier to understand the code, but it is not required for
correctness.  It would work just as well to emit all of the pseudo ops
other than `.fnend' in the same order, but immediately after `.fnstart'.

   The `.save' (*note .save pseudo op: arm_save.) pseudo op indicates
registers that have been saved to the stack so that they can be
restored before the function returns.  The argument to the `.save'
pseudo op is a list of registers to save.  If a register is
"callee-saved" (as specified by the ABI) and is modified by the
function you are writing, then your code must save the value before it
is modified and restore the original value before the function returns.
If an exception is thrown, the run-time library restores the values of
these registers from their locations on the stack before returning
control to the exception handler.  (Of course, if an exception is not
thrown, the function that contains the `.save' pseudo op restores these
registers in the function epilogue, as is done with the `ldmfd'
instruction above.)

   You do not have to save callee-saved registers at the very beginning
of the function and you do not need to use the `.save' pseudo op
immediately following the point at which the registers are saved.
However, if you modify a callee-saved register, you must save it on the
stack before modifying it and before calling any functions which might
throw an exception.  And, you must use the `.save' pseudo op to
indicate that you have done so.

   The `.pad' (*note .pad: arm_pad.) pseudo op indicates a modification
of the stack pointer that does not save any registers.  The argument is
the number of bytes (in decimal) that are subtracted from the stack
pointer.  (On ARM CPUs, the stack grows downwards, so subtracting from
the stack pointer increases the size of the stack.)

   The `.setfp' (*note .setfp pseudo op: arm_setfp.) pseudo op
indicates the register that contains the frame pointer.  The first
argument is the register that is set, which is typically `fp'.  The
second argument indicates the register from which the frame pointer
takes its value.  The third argument, if present, is the value (in
decimal) added to the register specified by the second argument to
compute the value of the frame pointer.  You should not modify the
frame pointer in the body of the function.

   If you do not use a frame pointer, then you should not use the
`.setfp' pseudo op.  If you do not use a frame pointer, then you should
avoid modifying the stack pointer outside of the function prologue.
Otherwise, the run-time library will be unable to find saved registers
when it is unwinding the stack.

   The pseudo ops described above are sufficient for writing assembly
code that calls functions which may throw exceptions.  If you need to
know more about the object-file format used to represent unwind
information, you may consult the `Exception Handling ABI for the ARM
Architecture' available from `http://infocenter.arm.com'.

9.5.2.1 Special Characters
..........................

The presence of a `;' anywhere on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `$' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

9.5.2.2 Register Names
......................

The AVR has 32 x 8-bit general purpose working registers `r0', `r1',
... `r31'.  Six of the 32 registers can be used as three 16-bit
indirect address register pointers for Data Space addressing. One of
the these address pointers can also be used as an address pointer for
look up tables in Flash program memory. These added function registers
are the 16-bit `X', `Y' and `Z' - registers.

     X = r26:r27
     Y = r28:r29
     Z = r30:r31

9.5.2.3 Relocatable Expression Modifiers
........................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using relocatable
addresses in AVR instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     modifier(relocatable-expression)

`lo8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 7 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.

`hi8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 7 through 15 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This is useful with,
     for example, the AVR `ldi' instruction and `lo8' modifier.

     For example

          ldi r26, lo8(sym+10)
          ldi r27, hi8(sym+10)

`hh8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 16 through 23 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  Also, can be useful
     for loading 32 bit constants.

`hlo8'
     Synonym of `hh8'.

`hhi8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 24 through 31 of an
     expression as 8 bit expression. This is useful with, for example,
     the AVR `ldi' instruction and `lo8', `hi8', `hlo8', `hhi8',
     modifier.

     For example

          ldi r26, lo8(285774925)
          ldi r27, hi8(285774925)
          ldi r28, hlo8(285774925)
          ldi r29, hhi8(285774925)
          ; r29,r28,r27,r26 = 285774925

`pm_lo8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 7 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This modifier useful
     for addressing data or code from Flash/Program memory. The using
     of `pm_lo8' similar to `lo8'.

`pm_hi8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 8 through 15 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This modifier useful
     for addressing data or code from Flash/Program memory.

`pm_hh8'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 15 through 23 of an address
     expression as 8 bit relocatable expression.  This modifier useful
     for addressing data or code from Flash/Program memory.

9.6.1 Options
-------------

`-mcpu=PROCESSOR[-SIREVISION]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The optional
     SIREVISION is not used in assembler.  It's here such that GCC can
     easily pass down its `-mcpu=' option.  The assembler will issue an
     error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction
     which will not execute on the target processor.  The following
     processor names are recognized: `bf504', `bf506', `bf512', `bf514',
     `bf516', `bf518', `bf522', `bf523', `bf524', `bf525', `bf526',
     `bf527', `bf531', `bf532', `bf533', `bf534', `bf535' (not
     implemented yet), `bf536', `bf537', `bf538', `bf539', `bf542',
     `bf542m', `bf544', `bf544m', `bf547', `bf547m', `bf548', `bf548m',
     `bf549', `bf549m', `bf561', and `bf592'.

`-mfdpic'
     Assemble for the FDPIC ABI.

`-mno-fdpic'
`-mnopic'
     Disable -mfdpic.

9.6.2 Syntax
------------

`Special Characters'
     Assembler input is free format and may appear anywhere on the line.
     One instruction may extend across multiple lines or more than one
     instruction may appear on the same line.  White space (space, tab,
     comments or newline) may appear anywhere between tokens.  A token
     must not have embedded spaces.  Tokens include numbers, register
     names, keywords, user identifiers, and also some multicharacter
     special symbols like "+=", "/*" or "||".

     Comments are introduced by the `#' character and extend to the end
     of the current line.  If the `#' appears as the first character of
     a line, the whole line is treated as a comment, but in this case
     the line can also be a logical line number directive (*note
     Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
     Preprocessing::).

`Instruction Delimiting'
     A semicolon must terminate every instruction.  Sometimes a complete
     instruction will consist of more than one operation.  There are two
     cases where this occurs.  The first is when two general operations
     are combined.  Normally a comma separates the different parts, as
     in

          a0= r3.h * r2.l, a1 = r3.l * r2.h ;

     The second case occurs when a general instruction is combined with
     one or two memory references for joint issue.  The latter portions
     are set off by a "||" token.

          a0 = r3.h * r2.l || r1 = [p3++] || r4 = [i2++];

     Multiple instructions can occur on the same line.  Each must be
     terminated by a semicolon character.

`Register Names'
     The assembler treats register names and instruction keywords in a
     case insensitive manner.  User identifiers are case sensitive.
     Thus, R3.l, R3.L, r3.l and r3.L are all equivalent input to the
     assembler.

     Register names are reserved and may not be used as program
     identifiers.

     Some operations (such as "Move Register") require a register pair.
     Register pairs are always data registers and are denoted using a
     colon, eg., R3:2.  The larger number must be written firsts.  Note
     that the hardware only supports odd-even pairs, eg., R7:6, R5:4,
     R3:2, and R1:0.

     Some instructions (such as -SP (Push Multiple)) require a group of
     adjacent registers.  Adjacent registers are denoted in the syntax
     by the range enclosed in parentheses and separated by a colon,
     eg., (R7:3).  Again, the larger number appears first.

     Portions of a particular register may be individually specified.
     This is written with a dot (".") following the register name and
     then a letter denoting the desired portion.  For 32-bit registers,
     ".H" denotes the most significant ("High") portion.  ".L" denotes
     the least-significant portion.  The subdivisions of the 40-bit
     registers are described later.

`Accumulators'
     The set of 40-bit registers A1 and A0 that normally contain data
     that is being manipulated.  Each accumulator can be accessed in
     four ways.

    `one 40-bit register'
          The register will be referred to as A1 or A0.

    `one 32-bit register'
          The registers are designated as A1.W or A0.W.

    `two 16-bit registers'
          The registers are designated as A1.H, A1.L, A0.H or A0.L.

    `one 8-bit register'
          The registers are designated as A1.X or A0.X for the bits that
          extend beyond bit 31.

`Data Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7)
     that normally contain data for manipulation.  These are
     abbreviated as D-register or Dreg.  Data registers can be accessed
     as 32-bit registers or as two independent 16-bit registers.  The
     least significant 16 bits of each register is called the "low"
     half and is designated with ".L" following the register name.  The
     most significant 16 bits are called the "high" half and is
     designated with ".H" following the name.

             R7.L, r2.h, r4.L, R0.H

`Pointer Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, SP and FP)
     that normally contain byte addresses of data structures.  These are
     abbreviated as P-register or Preg.

          p2, p5, fp, sp

`Stack Pointer SP'
     The stack pointer contains the 32-bit address of the last occupied
     byte location in the stack.  The stack grows by decrementing the
     stack pointer.

`Frame Pointer FP'
     The frame pointer contains the 32-bit address of the previous frame
     pointer in the stack.  It is located at the top of a frame.

`Loop Top'
     LT0 and LT1.  These registers contain the 32-bit address of the
     top of a zero overhead loop.

`Loop Count'
     LC0 and LC1.  These registers contain the 32-bit counter of the
     zero overhead loop executions.

`Loop Bottom'
     LB0 and LB1.  These registers contain the 32-bit address of the
     bottom of a zero overhead loop.

`Index Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (I0, I1, I2, I3) that normally contain
     byte addresses of data structures.  Abbreviated I-register or Ireg.

`Modify Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (M0, M1, M2, M3) that normally contain
     offset values that are added and subtracted to one of the index
     registers.  Abbreviated as Mreg.

`Length Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (L0, L1, L2, L3) that normally contain
     the length in bytes of the circular buffer.  Abbreviated as Lreg.
     Clear the Lreg to disable circular addressing for the
     corresponding Ireg.

`Base Registers'
     The set of 32-bit registers (B0, B1, B2, B3) that normally contain
     the base address in bytes of the circular buffer.  Abbreviated as
     Breg.

`Floating Point'
     The Blackfin family has no hardware floating point but the .float
     directive generates ieee floating point numbers for use with
     software floating point libraries.

`Blackfin Opcodes'

9.7.1 CR16 Operand Qualifiers
-----------------------------

The National Semiconductor CR16 target of `as' has a few machine
dependent operand qualifiers.

   Operand expression type qualifier is an optional field in the
instruction operand, to determines the type of the expression field of
an operand. The `@' is required. CR16 architecture uses one of the
following expression qualifiers:

`s'
     - `Specifies expression operand type as small'

`m'
     - `Specifies expression operand type as medium'

`l'
     - `Specifies expression operand type as large'

`c'
     - `Specifies the CR16 Assembler generates a relocation entry for
     the operand, where pc has implied bit, the expression is adjusted
     accordingly. The linker uses the relocation entry to update the
     operand address at link time.'

`got/GOT'
     - `Specifies the CR16 Assembler generates a relocation entry for
     the operand, offset from Global Offset Table. The linker uses this
     relocation entry to update the operand address at link time'

`cgot/cGOT'
     - `Specifies the CompactRISC Assembler generates a relocation
     entry for the operand, where pc has implied bit, the expression is
     adjusted accordingly. The linker uses the relocation entry to
     update the operand address at link time.'

   CR16 target operand qualifiers and its size (in bits):

`Immediate Operand: s'
     4 bits.

`Immediate Operand: m'
     16 bits, for movb and movw instructions.

`Immediate Operand: m'
     20 bits, movd instructions.

`Immediate Operand: l'
     32 bits.

`Absolute Operand: s'
     Illegal specifier for this operand.

`Absolute Operand: m'
     20 bits, movd instructions.

`Displacement Operand: s'
     8 bits.

`Displacement Operand: m'
     16 bits.

`Displacement Operand: l'
     24 bits.


   For example:
     1   `movw $_myfun@c,r1'

         This loads the address of _myfun, shifted right by 1, into r1.

     2   `movd $_myfun@c,(r2,r1)'

         This loads the address of _myfun, shifted right by 1, into register-pair r2-r1.

     3   `_myfun_ptr:'
         `.long _myfun@c'
         `loadd _myfun_ptr, (r1,r0)'
         `jal (r1,r0)'

         This .long directive, the address of _myfunc, shifted right by 1 at link time.

     4   `loadd  _data1@GOT(r12), (r1,r0)'

         This loads the address of _data1, into global offset table (ie GOT) and its offset value from GOT loads into register-pair r2-r1.

     5   `loadd  _myfunc@cGOT(r12), (r1,r0)'

         This loads the address of _myfun, shifted right by 1, into global offset table (ie GOT) and its offset value from GOT loads into register-pair r1-r0.

(*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same

9.8.1 Command-line Options
--------------------------

The CRIS version of `as' has these machine-dependent command-line
options.

   The format of the generated object files can be either ELF or a.out,
specified by the command-line options `--emulation=crisaout' and
`--emulation=criself'.  The default is ELF (criself), unless `as' has
been configured specifically for a.out by using the configuration name
`cris-axis-aout'.

   There are two different link-incompatible ELF object file variants
for CRIS, for use in environments where symbols are expected to be
prefixed by a leading `_' character and for environments without such a
symbol prefix.  The variant used for GNU/Linux port has no symbol
prefix.  Which variant to produce is specified by either of the options
`--underscore' and `--no-underscore'.  The default is `--underscore'.
Since symbols in CRIS a.out objects are expected to have a `_' prefix,
specifying `--no-underscore' when generating a.out objects is an error.
Besides the object format difference, the effect of this option is to
parse register names differently (*note crisnous::).  The
`--no-underscore' option makes a `$' register prefix mandatory.

   The option `--pic' must be passed to `as' in order to recognize the
symbol syntax used for ELF (SVR4 PIC) position-independent-code (*note
crispic::).  This will also affect expansion of instructions.  The
expansion with `--pic' will use PC-relative rather than (slightly
faster) absolute addresses in those expansions.  This option is only
valid when generating ELF format object files.

   The option `--march=ARCHITECTURE' specifies the recognized
instruction set and recognized register names.  It also controls the
architecture type of the object file.  Valid values for ARCHITECTURE
are:
`v0_v10'
     All instructions and register names for any architecture variant
     in the set v0...v10 are recognized.  This is the default if the
     target is configured as cris-*.

`v10'
     Only instructions and register names for CRIS v10 (as found in
     ETRAX 100 LX) are recognized.  This is the default if the target
     is configured as crisv10-*.

`v32'
     Only instructions and register names for CRIS v32 (code name
     Guinness) are recognized.  This is the default if the target is
     configured as crisv32-*.  This value implies `--no-mul-bug-abort'.
     (A subsequent `--mul-bug-abort' will turn it back on.)

`common_v10_v32'
     Only instructions with register names and addressing modes with
     opcodes common to the v10 and v32 are recognized.

   When `-N' is specified, `as' will emit a warning when a 16-bit
branch instruction is expanded into a 32-bit multiple-instruction
construct (*note CRIS-Expand::).

   Some versions of the CRIS v10, for example in the Etrax 100 LX,
contain a bug that causes destabilizing memory accesses when a multiply
instruction is executed with certain values in the first operand just
before a cache-miss.  When the `--mul-bug-abort' command line option is
active (the default value), `as' will refuse to assemble a file
containing a multiply instruction at a dangerous offset, one that could
be the last on a cache-line, or is in a section with insufficient
alignment.  This placement checking does not catch any case where the
multiply instruction is dangerously placed because it is located in a
delay-slot.  The `--mul-bug-abort' command line option turns off the
checking.


File: as.info,  Node: CRIS-Expand,  Next: CRIS-Symbols,  Prev: CRIS-Opts,  Up: CRIS-Dependent

9.8.2 Instruction expansion
---------------------------

`as' will silently choose an instruction that fits the operand size for
`[register+constant]' operands.  For example, the offset `127' in
`move.d [r3+127],r4' fits in an instruction using a signed-byte offset.
Similarly, `move.d [r2+32767],r1' will generate an instruction using a
16-bit offset.  For symbolic expressions and constants that do not fit
in 16 bits including the sign bit, a 32-bit offset is generated.

   For branches, `as' will expand from a 16-bit branch instruction into
a sequence of instructions that can reach a full 32-bit address.  Since
this does not correspond to a single instruction, such expansions can
optionally be warned about.  *Note CRIS-Opts::.

   If the operand is found to fit the range, a `lapc' mnemonic will
translate to a `lapcq' instruction.  Use `lapc.d' to force the 32-bit
`lapc' instruction.

   Similarly, the `addo' mnemonic will translate to the shortest
fitting instruction of `addoq', `addo.w' and `addo.d', when used with a
operand that is a constant known at assembly time.

9.8.3 Symbols
-------------

Some symbols are defined by the assembler.  They're intended to be used
in conditional assembly, for example:
      .if ..asm.arch.cris.v32
      CODE FOR CRIS V32
      .elseif ..asm.arch.cris.common_v10_v32
      CODE COMMON TO CRIS V32 AND CRIS V10
      .elseif ..asm.arch.cris.v10 | ..asm.arch.cris.any_v0_v10
      CODE FOR V10
      .else
      .error "Code needs to be added here."
      .endif

   These symbols are defined in the assembler, reflecting command-line
options, either when specified or the default.  They are always
defined, to 0 or 1.
`..asm.arch.cris.any_v0_v10'
     This symbol is non-zero when `--march=v0_v10' is specified or the
     default.

`..asm.arch.cris.common_v10_v32'
     Set according to the option `--march=common_v10_v32'.

`..asm.arch.cris.v10'
     Reflects the option `--march=v10'.

`..asm.arch.cris.v32'
     Corresponds to `--march=v10'.

   Speaking of symbols, when a symbol is used in code, it can have a
suffix modifying its value for use in position-independent code. *Note
CRIS-Pic::.

9.8.4.1 Special Characters
..........................

The character `#' is a line comment character.  It starts a comment if
and only if it is placed at the beginning of a line.

   A `;' character starts a comment anywhere on the line, causing all
characters up to the end of the line to be ignored.

   A `@' character is handled as a line separator equivalent to a
logical new-line character (except in a comment), so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.

9.8.4.2 Symbols in position-independent code
............................................

When generating position-independent code (SVR4 PIC) for use in
cris-axis-linux-gnu or crisv32-axis-linux-gnu shared libraries, symbol
suffixes are used to specify what kind of run-time symbol lookup will
be used, expressed in the object as different _relocation types_.
Usually, all absolute symbol values must be located in a table, the
_global offset table_, leaving the code position-independent;
independent of values of global symbols and independent of the address
of the code.  The suffix modifies the value of the symbol, into for
example an index into the global offset table where the real symbol
value is entered, or a PC-relative value, or a value relative to the
start of the global offset table.  All symbol suffixes start with the
character `:' (omitted in the list below).  Every symbol use in code or
a read-only section must therefore have a PIC suffix to enable a useful
shared library to be created.  Usually, these constructs must not be
used with an additive constant offset as is usually allowed, i.e. no 4
as in `symbol + 4' is allowed.  This restriction is checked at
link-time, not at assembly-time.

`GOT'
     Attaching this suffix to a symbol in an instruction causes the
     symbol to be entered into the global offset table.  The value is a
     32-bit index for that symbol into the global offset table.  The
     name of the corresponding relocation is `R_CRIS_32_GOT'.  Example:
     `move.d [$r0+extsym:GOT],$r9'

`GOT16'
     Same as for `GOT', but the value is a 16-bit index into the global
     offset table.  The corresponding relocation is `R_CRIS_16_GOT'.
     Example: `move.d [$r0+asymbol:GOT16],$r10'

`PLT'
     This suffix is used for function symbols.  It causes a _procedure
     linkage table_, an array of code stubs, to be created at the time
     the shared object is created or linked against, together with a
     global offset table entry.  The value is a pc-relative offset to
     the corresponding stub code in the procedure linkage table.  This
     arrangement causes the run-time symbol resolver to be called to
     look up and set the value of the symbol the first time the
     function is called (at latest; depending environment variables).
     It is only safe to leave the symbol unresolved this way if all
     references are function calls.  The name of the relocation is
     `R_CRIS_32_PLT_PCREL'.  Example: `add.d fnname:PLT,$pc'

`PLTG'
     Like PLT, but the value is relative to the beginning of the global
     offset table.  The relocation is `R_CRIS_32_PLT_GOTREL'.  Example:
     `move.d fnname:PLTG,$r3'

`GOTPLT'
     Similar to `PLT', but the value of the symbol is a 32-bit index
     into the global offset table.  This is somewhat of a mix between
     the effect of the `GOT' and the `PLT' suffix; the difference to
     `GOT' is that there will be a procedure linkage table entry
     created, and that the symbol is assumed to be a function entry and
     will be resolved by the run-time resolver as with `PLT'.  The
     relocation is `R_CRIS_32_GOTPLT'.  Example: `jsr
     [$r0+fnname:GOTPLT]'

`GOTPLT16'
     A variant of `GOTPLT' giving a 16-bit value.  Its relocation name
     is `R_CRIS_16_GOTPLT'.  Example: `jsr [$r0+fnname:GOTPLT16]'

`GOTOFF'
     This suffix must only be attached to a local symbol, but may be
     used in an expression adding an offset.  The value is the address
     of the symbol relative to the start of the global offset table.
     The relocation name is `R_CRIS_32_GOTREL'.  Example: `move.d
     [$r0+localsym:GOTOFF],r3'

9.8.4.3 Register names
......................

A `$' character may always prefix a general or special register name in
an instruction operand but is mandatory when the option
`--no-underscore' is specified or when the `.syntax register_prefix'
directive is in effect (*note crisnous::).  Register names are
case-insensitive.


File: as.info,  Node: CRIS-Pseudos,  Prev: CRIS-Regs,  Up: CRIS-Syntax

9.8.4.4 Assembler Directives
............................

There are a few CRIS-specific pseudo-directives in addition to the
generic ones.  *Note Pseudo Ops::.  Constants emitted by
pseudo-directives are in little-endian order for CRIS.  There is no
support for floating-point-specific directives for CRIS.

`.dword EXPRESSIONS'
     The `.dword' directive is a synonym for `.int', expecting zero or
     more EXPRESSIONS, separated by commas.  For each expression, a
     32-bit little-endian constant is emitted.

`.syntax ARGUMENT'
     The `.syntax' directive takes as ARGUMENT one of the following
     case-sensitive choices.

    `no_register_prefix'
          The `.syntax no_register_prefix' directive makes a `$'
          character prefix on all registers optional.  It overrides a
          previous setting, including the corresponding effect of the
          option `--no-underscore'.  If this directive is used when
          ordinary symbols do not have a `_' character prefix, care
          must be taken to avoid ambiguities whether an operand is a
          register or a symbol; using symbols with names the same as
          general or special registers then invoke undefined behavior.

    `register_prefix'
          This directive makes a `$' character prefix on all registers
          mandatory.  It overrides a previous setting, including the
          corresponding effect of the option `--underscore'.

    `leading_underscore'
          This is an assertion directive, emitting an error if the
          `--no-underscore' option is in effect.

    `no_leading_underscore'
          This is the opposite of the `.syntax leading_underscore'
          directive and emits an error if the option `--underscore' is
          in effect.

`.arch ARGUMENT'
     This is an assertion directive, giving an error if the specified
     ARGUMENT is not the same as the specified or default value for the
     `--march=ARCHITECTURE' option (*note march-option::).

9.9.1 D10V Options
------------------

The Mitsubishi D10V version of `as' has a few machine dependent options.

`-O'
     The D10V can often execute two sub-instructions in parallel. When
     this option is used, `as' will attempt to optimize its output by
     detecting when instructions can be executed in parallel.

`--nowarnswap'
     To optimize execution performance, `as' will sometimes swap the
     order of instructions. Normally this generates a warning. When
     this option is used, no warning will be generated when
     instructions are swapped.

`--gstabs-packing'
`--no-gstabs-packing'
     `as' packs adjacent short instructions into a single packed
     instruction. `--no-gstabs-packing' turns instruction packing off if
     `--gstabs' is specified as well; `--gstabs-packing' (the default)
     turns instruction packing on even when `--gstabs' is specified.

9.9.2.1 Size Modifiers
......................

The D10V version of `as' uses the instruction names in the D10V
Architecture Manual.  However, the names in the manual are sometimes
ambiguous.  There are instruction names that can assemble to a short or
long form opcode.  How does the assembler pick the correct form?  `as'
will always pick the smallest form if it can.  When dealing with a
symbol that is not defined yet when a line is being assembled, it will
always use the long form.  If you need to force the assembler to use
either the short or long form of the instruction, you can append either
`.s' (short) or `.l' (long) to it.  For example, if you are writing an
assembly program and you want to do a branch to a symbol that is
defined later in your program, you can write `bra.s   foo'.  Objdump
and GDB will always append `.s' or `.l' to instructions which have both
short and long forms.

9.9.2.2 Sub-Instructions
........................

The D10V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either
one-per-line, or in the special two-per-line format described in the
next section.  Some of these instructions will be short-form or
sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed into a single
instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also
detect when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label
is defined, the next instruction will never be packaged with the
previous one.  Whenever a branch and link instruction is called, it
will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return address
will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

   If you do not want the assembler automatically making these
decisions, you can control the packaging and execution type (parallel
or sequential) with the special execution symbols described in the next
section.


File: as.info,  Node: D10V-Chars,  Next: D10V-Regs,  Prev: D10V-Subs,  Up: D10V-Syntax

9.9.2.3 Special Characters
..........................

A semicolon (`;') can be used anywhere on a line to start a comment
that extends to the end of the line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Sub-instructions may be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in
parallel.  Instructions listed in the standard one-per-line format will
be executed sequentially.  To specify the executing order, use the
following symbols:
`->'
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

`<-'
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

`||'
     Parallel
   The D10V syntax allows either one instruction per line, one
instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions per
line.  For example
`abs       a1      ->      abs     r0'
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

`abs       r0      <-      abs     a1'
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+         ||      mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Execute these in parallel.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+         ||'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially.  Assembler will put
     them in the proper containers.

`ld2w    r2,@r8+         ->'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially.  Same as above but
     second instruction will always go into right container.
   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.9.2.4 Register Names
......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r15' to refer to the
D10V registers.  You can also use `sp' as an alias for `r15'.  The
accumulators are `a0' and `a1'.  There are special register-pair names
that may optionally be used in opcodes that require even-numbered
registers. Register names are not case sensitive.

   Register Pairs
`r0-r1'

`r2-r3'

`r4-r5'

`r6-r7'

`r8-r9'

`r10-r11'

the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.
`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@RN-'
     Register indirect with post-decrement

`@-SP'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@(DISP, RN)'

9.9.2.6 @WORD Modifier
......................

Any symbol followed by `@word' will be replaced by the symbol's value
shifted right by 2.  This is used in situations such as loading a
register with the address of a function (or any other code fragment).
For example, if you want to load a register with the location of the
function `main' then jump to that function, you could do it as follows:
     ldi     r2, main@word
     jmp     r2

9.10.1 D30V Options
-------------------

The Mitsubishi D30V version of `as' has a few machine dependent options.

`-O'
     The D30V can often execute two sub-instructions in parallel. When
     this option is used, `as' will attempt to optimize its output by
     detecting when instructions can be executed in parallel.

`-n'
     When this option is used, `as' will issue a warning every time it
     adds a nop instruction.

`-N'
     When this option is used, `as' will issue a warning if it needs to
     insert a nop after a 32-bit multiply before a load or 16-bit
     multiply instruction.

9.10.2.1 Size Modifiers
.......................

The D30V version of `as' uses the instruction names in the D30V
Architecture Manual.  However, the names in the manual are sometimes
ambiguous.  There are instruction names that can assemble to a short or
long form opcode.  How does the assembler pick the correct form?  `as'
will always pick the smallest form if it can.  When dealing with a
symbol that is not defined yet when a line is being assembled, it will
always use the long form.  If you need to force the assembler to use
either the short or long form of the instruction, you can append either
`.s' (short) or `.l' (long) to it.  For example, if you are writing an
assembly program and you want to do a branch to a symbol that is
defined later in your program, you can write `bra.s foo'.  Objdump and
GDB will always append `.s' or `.l' to instructions which have both
short and long forms.

9.10.2.2 Sub-Instructions
.........................

The D30V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either
one-per-line, or in the special two-per-line format described in the
next section.  Some of these instructions will be short-form or
sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed into a single
instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also
detect when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label
is defined, the next instruction will never be packaged with the
previous one.  Whenever a branch and link instruction is called, it
will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return address
will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

   If you do not want the assembler automatically making these
decisions, you can control the packaging and execution type (parallel
or sequential) with the special execution symbols described in the next
section.

9.10.2.3 Special Characters
...........................

A semicolon (`;') can be used anywhere on a line to start a comment
that extends to the end of the line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Sub-instructions may be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in
parallel.  Instructions listed in the standard one-per-line format will
be executed sequentially unless you use the `-O' option.

   To specify the executing order, use the following symbols:
`->'
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

`<-'
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

`||'
     Parallel

   The D30V syntax allows either one instruction per line, one
instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions per
line.  For example
`abs r2,r3 -> abs r4,r5'
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

`abs r2,r3 <- abs r4,r5'
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

`abs r2,r3 || abs r4,r5'
     Execute these in parallel.

`ldw r2,@(r3,r4) ||'
`mulx r6,r8,r9'
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

`mulx a0,r8,r9'
`stw r2,@(r3,r4)'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially unless `-O' option is
     used.  If the `-O' option is used, the assembler will determine if
     the instructions could be done in parallel (the above two
     instructions can be done in parallel), and if so, emit them as
     parallel instructions.  The assembler will put them in the proper
     containers.  In the above example, the assembler will put the
     `stw' instruction in left container and the `mulx' instruction in
     the right container.

`stw r2,@(r3,r4) ->'
`mulx a0,r8,r9'
     Two-line format.  Execute the `stw' instruction followed by the
     `mulx' instruction sequentially.  The first instruction goes in the
     left container and the second instruction goes into right
     container.  The assembler will give an error if the machine
     ordering constraints are violated.

`stw r2,@(r3,r4) <-'
`mulx a0,r8,r9'
     Same as previous example, except that the `mulx' instruction is
     executed before the `stw' instruction.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.10.2.4 Guarded Execution
..........................

`as' supports the full range of guarded execution directives for each
instruction.  Just append the directive after the instruction proper.
The directives are:

`/tx'
     Execute the instruction if flag f0 is true.

`/fx'
     Execute the instruction if flag f0 is false.

`/xt'
     Execute the instruction if flag f1 is true.

`/xf'
     Execute the instruction if flag f1 is false.

`/tt'
     Execute the instruction if both flags f0 and f1 are true.

`/tf'
     Execute the instruction if flag f0 is true and flag f1 is false.

.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to the
D30V registers.  You can also use `sp' as an alias for `r63' and `link'
as an alias for `r62'.  The accumulators are `a0' and `a1'.

   The D30V also has predefined symbols for these control registers and
status bits:

9.12.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use predefined symbols of the form `rNh' and `rNl' to refer to
the H8/300 registers as sixteen 8-bit general-purpose registers.  N is
a digit from `0' to `7'); for instance, both `r0h' and `r7l' are valid
register names.

   You can also use the eight predefined symbols `rN' to refer to the
H8/300 registers as 16-bit registers (you must use this form for
addressing).

   On the H8/300H, you can also use the eight predefined symbols `erN'
(`er0' ... `er7') to refer to the 32-bit general purpose registers.

   The two control registers are called `pc' (program counter; a 16-bit
register, except on the H8/300H where it is 24 bits) and `ccr'
(condition code register; an 8-bit register).  `r7' is used as the
stack pointer, and can also be called `sp'.

`@(D, rN)'
`@(D:16, rN)'
`@(D:24, rN)'
     Register indirect: 16-bit or 24-bit displacement D from register
     N.  (24-bit displacements are only meaningful on the H8/300H.)

`@rN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@-rN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

``@'AA'
``@'AA:8'
``@'AA:16'
``@'AA:24'
     Absolute address `aa'.  (The address size `:24' only makes sense
     on the H8/300H.)

`#XX'
`#XX:8'
`#XX:16'
`#XX:32'
     Immediate data XX.  You may specify the `:8', `:16', or `:32' for
     clarity, if you wish; but `as' neither requires this nor uses
     it--the data size required is taken from context.

``@'`@'AA'
``@'`@'AA:8'
     Memory indirect.  You may specify the `:8' for clarity, if you

`.h8300s'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8S variant, and
     also make `.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than the usual (16-bit)
     for the H8/300 family.

`.h8300hn'

   Four H8/300 instructions (`add', `cmp', `mov', `sub') are defined
with variants using the suffixes `.b', `.w', and `.l' to specify the
size of a memory operand.  `as' supports these suffixes, but does not
require them; since one of the operands is always a register, `as' can
deduce the correct size.

   For example, since `r0' refers to a 16-bit register,
     mov    r0,@foo
is equivalent to
     mov.w  r0,@foo

   If you use the size suffixes, `as' issues a warning when the suffix
and the register size do not match.

9.13.1 Notes
------------

As a back end for GNU CC `as' has been throughly tested and should work
extremely well.  We have tested it only minimally on hand written
assembly code and no one has tested it much on the assembly output from
the HP compilers.

   The format of the debugging sections has changed since the original
`as' port (version 1.3X) was released; therefore, you must rebuild all
HPPA objects and libraries with the new assembler so that you can debug
the final executable.

   The HPPA `as' port generates a small subset of the relocations
available in the SOM and ELF object file formats.  Additional relocation
support will be added as it becomes necessary.

9.13.2 Options
--------------

`as' has no machine-dependent command-line options for the HPPA.


File: as.info,  Node: HPPA Syntax,  Next: HPPA Floating Point,  Prev: HPPA Options,  Up: HPPA-Dependent

9.13.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the HPPA instruction set reference
manual; assembler directives and general syntax closely follow the HPPA
assembly language reference manual, with a few noteworthy differences.

   First, a colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.

   Some obscure expression parsing problems may affect hand written
code which uses the `spop' instructions, or code which makes significant
use of the `!' line separator.

   `as' is much less forgiving about missing arguments and other
similar oversights than the HP assembler.  `as' notifies you of missing
arguments as syntax errors; this is regarded as a feature, not a bug.

   Finally, `as' allows you to use an external symbol without
explicitly importing the symbol.  _Warning:_ in the future this will be
an error for HPPA targets.

   Special characters for HPPA targets include:

   `;' is the line comment character.

   `!' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.13.5 HPPA Assembler Directives
--------------------------------

`as' for the HPPA supports many additional directives for compatibility
with the native assembler.  This section describes them only briefly.
For detailed information on HPPA-specific assembler directives, see
`HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001).

   `as' does _not_ support the following assembler directives described
in the HP manual:

     .endm           .liston
     .enter          .locct
     .leave          .macro
     .listoff

   Beyond those implemented for compatibility, `as' supports one
additional assembler directive for the HPPA: `.param'.  It conveys
register argument locations for static functions.  Its syntax closely
follows the `.export' directive.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the HPPA:

`.block N'
`.blockz N'
     Reserve N bytes of storage, and initialize them to zero.

`.call'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure call.  Only the special case
     with _no arguments_ is allowed.

`.callinfo [ PARAM=VALUE, ... ]  [ FLAG, ... ]'
     Specify a number of parameters and flags that define the
     environment for a procedure.

     PARAM may be any of `frame' (frame size), `entry_gr' (end of
     general register range), `entry_fr' (end of float register range),
     `entry_sr' (end of space register range).

     The values for FLAG are `calls' or `caller' (proc has
     subroutines), `no_calls' (proc does not call subroutines),
     `save_rp' (preserve return pointer), `save_sp' (proc preserves
     stack pointer), `no_unwind' (do not unwind this proc), `hpux_int'
     (proc is interrupt routine).

`.code'
     Assemble into the standard section called `$TEXT$', subsection
     `$CODE$'.

`.copyright "STRING"'
     In the SOM object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a copyright string.

`.copyright "STRING"'
     In the ELF object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a version string.

`.enter'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

`.entry'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure.

`.exit'
     Mark the end of a procedure.

`.export NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Make a procedure NAME available to callers.  TYP, if present, must
     be one of `absolute', `code' (ELF only, not SOM), `data', `entry',
     `data', `entry', `millicode', `plabel', `pri_prog', or `sec_prog'.

     PARAM, if present, provides either relocation information for the
     procedure arguments and result, or a privilege level.  PARAM may be
     `argwN' (where N ranges from `0' to `3', and indicates one of four
     one-word arguments); `rtnval' (the procedure's result); or
     `priv_lev' (privilege level).  For arguments or the result, R
     specifies how to relocate, and must be one of `no' (not
     relocatable), `gr' (argument is in general register), `fr' (in
     floating point register), or `fu' (upper half of float register).
     For `priv_lev', R is an integer.

`.half N'
     Define a two-byte integer constant N; synonym for the portable
     `as' directive `.short'.

`.import NAME [ ,TYP ]'
     Converse of `.export'; make a procedure available to call.  The
     arguments use the same conventions as the first two arguments for
     `.export'.

`.label NAME'
     Define NAME as a label for the current assembly location.

`.leave'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

`.origin LC'
     Advance location counter to LC. Synonym for the `as' portable
     directive `.org'.

`.param NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Similar to `.export', but used for static procedures.

`.proc'
     Use preceding the first statement of a procedure.

`.procend'
     Use following the last statement of a procedure.

`LABEL .reg EXPR'
     Synonym for `.equ'; define LABEL with the absolute expression EXPR
     as its value.

`.space SECNAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Switch to section SECNAME, creating a new section by that name if
     necessary.  You may only use PARAMS when creating a new section,
     not when switching to an existing one.  SECNAME may identify a
     section by number rather than by name.

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the section,
     identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are `spnum=EXP'
     (identify this section by the number EXP, an absolute expression),
     `sort=EXP' (order sections according to this sort key when linking;
     EXP is an absolute expression), `unloadable' (section contains no
     loadable data), `notdefined' (this section defined elsewhere), and
     `private' (data in this section not available to other programs).

`.spnum SECNAM'
     Allocate four bytes of storage, and initialize them with the
     section number of the section named SECNAM.  (You can define the
     section number with the HPPA `.space' directive.)

`.string "STR"'
     Copy the characters in the string STR to the object file.  *Note
     Strings: Strings, for information on escape sequences you can use
     in `as' strings.

     _Warning!_ The HPPA version of `.string' differs from the usual
     `as' definition: it does _not_ write a zero byte after copying STR.

`.stringz "STR"'
     Like `.string', but appends a zero byte after copying STR to object
     file.

`.subspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
`.nsubspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Similar to `.space', but selects a subsection NAME within the
     current section.  You may only specify PARAMS when you create a
     subsection (in the first instance of `.subspa' for this NAME).

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the
     subsection, identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are
     `quad=EXPR' ("quadrant" for this subsection), `align=EXPR'
     (alignment for beginning of this subsection; a power of two),
     `access=EXPR' (value for "access rights" field), `sort=EXPR'
     (sorting order for this subspace in link), `code_only' (subsection
     contains only code), `unloadable' (subsection cannot be loaded
     into memory), `comdat' (subsection is comdat), `common'
     (subsection is common block), `dup_comm' (subsection may have
     duplicate names), or `zero' (subsection is all zeros, do not write
     in object file).

     `.nsubspa' always creates a new subspace with the given name, even
     if one with the same name already exists.

     `comdat', `common' and `dup_comm' can be used to implement various
     flavors of one-only support when using the SOM linker.  The SOM
     linker only supports specific combinations of these flags.  The
     details are not documented.  A brief description is provided here.

     `comdat' provides a form of linkonce support.  It is useful for
     both code and data subspaces.  A `comdat' subspace has a key symbol
     marked by the `is_comdat' flag or `ST_COMDAT'.  Only the first
     subspace for any given key is selected.  The key symbol becomes
     universal in shared links.  This is similar to the behavior of
     `secondary_def' symbols.

     `common' provides Fortran named common support.  It is only useful
     for data subspaces.  Symbols with the flag `is_common' retain this
     flag in shared links.  Referencing a `is_common' symbol in a shared
     library from outside the library doesn't work.  Thus, `is_common'
     symbols must be output whenever they are needed.

     `common' and `dup_comm' together provide Cobol common support.
     The subspaces in this case must all be the same length.
     Otherwise, this support is similar to the Fortran common support.

     `dup_comm' by itself provides a type of one-only support for code.
     Only the first `dup_comm' subspace is selected.  There is a rather
     complex algorithm to compare subspaces.  Code symbols marked with
     the `dup_common' flag are hidden.  This support was intended for
     "C++ duplicate inlines".

     A simplified technique is used to mark the flags of symbols based
     on the flags of their subspace.  A symbol with the scope
     SS_UNIVERSAL and type ST_ENTRY, ST_CODE or ST_DATA is marked with
     the corresponding settings of `comdat', `common' and `dup_comm'
     from the subspace, respectively.  This avoids having to introduce
     additional directives to mark these symbols.  The HP assembler
     sets `is_common' from `common'.  However, it doesn't set the
     `dup_common' from `dup_comm'.  It doesn't have `comdat' support.

`.version "STR"'
     Write STR as version identifier in object code.

9.14.1 Notes
------------

The ESA/390 `as' port is currently intended to be a back-end for the
GNU CC compiler.  It is not HLASM compatible, although it does support
a subset of some of the HLASM directives.  The only supported binary
file format is ELF; none of the usual MVS/VM/OE/USS object file
formats, such as ESD or XSD, are supported.

   When used with the GNU CC compiler, the ESA/390 `as' will produce
correct, fully relocated, functional binaries, and has been used to
compile and execute large projects.  However, many aspects should still
be considered experimental; these include shared library support,
dynamically loadable objects, and any relocation other than the 31-bit
relocation.

9.14.3 Syntax
-------------

The opcode/operand syntax follows the ESA/390 Principles of Operation
manual; assembler directives and general syntax are loosely based on the
prevailing AT&T/SVR4/ELF/Solaris style notation.  HLASM-style directives
are _not_ supported for the most part, with the exception of those
described herein.

   A leading dot in front of directives is optional, and the case of
directives is ignored; thus for example, .using and USING have the same
effect.

   A colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is simply
for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers write
code.

   `#' is the line comment character.

   `;' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

   Registers can be given the symbolic names r0..r15, fp0, fp2, fp4,
fp6.  By using thesse symbolic names, `as' can detect simple syntax
errors. The name rarg or r.arg is a synonym for r11, rtca or r.tca for
r12, sp, r.sp, dsa r.dsa for r13, lr or r.lr for r14, rbase or r.base
for r3 and rpgt or r.pgt for r4.

   `*' is the current location counter.  Unlike `.' it is always
relative to the last USING directive.  Note that this means that
expressions cannot use multiplication, as any occurrence of `*' will be
interpreted as a location counter.

   All labels are relative to the last USING.  Thus, branches to a label
always imply the use of base+displacement.

   Many of the usual forms of address constants / address literals are
supported.  Thus,
     	.using	*,r3
     	L	r15,=A(some_routine)
     	LM	r6,r7,=V(some_longlong_extern)
     	A	r1,=F'12'
     	AH	r0,=H'42'
     	ME	r6,=E'3.1416'
     	MD	r6,=D'3.14159265358979'
     	O	r6,=XL4'cacad0d0'
     	.ltorg
   should all behave as expected: that is, an entry in the literal pool
will be created (or reused if it already exists), and the instruction
operands will be the displacement into the literal pool using the
current base register (as last declared with the `.using' directive).

9.14.4 Floating Point
---------------------

The assembler generates only IEEE floating-point numbers.  The older
floating point formats are not supported.

9.14.5 ESA/390 Assembler Directives
-----------------------------------

`as' for the ESA/390 supports all of the standard ELF/SVR4 assembler
directives that are documented in the main part of this documentation.
Several additional directives are supported in order to implement the
ESA/390 addressing model.  The most important of these are `.using' and
`.ltorg'

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the ESA/390:

`.dc'
     A small subset of the usual DC directive is supported.

`.drop REGNO'
     Stop using REGNO as the base register.  The REGNO must have been
     previously declared with a `.using' directive in the same section
     as the current section.

`.ebcdic STRING'
     Emit the EBCDIC equivalent of the indicated string.  The emitted
     string will be null terminated.  Note that the directives
     `.string' etc. emit ascii strings by default.

`EQU'
     The standard HLASM-style EQU directive is not supported; however,
     the standard `as' directive .equ can be used to the same effect.

`.ltorg'
     Dump the literal pool accumulated so far; begin a new literal pool.
     The literal pool will be written in the current section; in order
     to generate correct assembly, a `.using' must have been previously
     specified in the same section.

`.using EXPR,REGNO'
     Use REGNO as the base register for all subsequent RX, RS, and SS
     form instructions. The EXPR will be evaluated to obtain the base
     address; usually, EXPR will merely be `*'.

     This assembler allows two `.using' directives to be simultaneously
     outstanding, one in the `.text' section, and one in another section
     (typically, the `.data' section).  This feature allows dynamically
     loaded objects to be implemented in a relatively straightforward
     way.  A `.using' directive must always be specified in the `.text'
     section; this will specify the base register that will be used for
     branches in the `.text' section.  A second `.using' may be
     specified in another section; this will specify the base register
     that is used for non-label address literals.  When a second
     `.using' is specified, then the subsequent `.ltorg' must be put in
     the same section; otherwise an error will result.

     Thus, for example, the following code uses `r3' to address branch
     targets and `r4' to address the literal pool, which has been
     written to the `.data' section.  The is, the constants
     `=A(some_routine)', `=H'42'' and `=E'3.1416'' will all appear in
     the `.data' section.

          .data
          	.using  LITPOOL,r4
          .text
          	BASR	r3,0
          	.using	*,r3
                  B       START
          	.long	LITPOOL
          START:
          	L	r4,4(,r3)
          	L	r15,=A(some_routine)
          	LTR	r15,r15
          	BNE	LABEL
          	AH	r0,=H'42'
          LABEL:
          	ME	r6,=E'3.1416'
          .data
          LITPOOL:
          	.ltorg

     Note that this dual-`.using' directive semantics extends and is
     not compatible with HLASM semantics.  Note that this assembler
     directive does not support the full range of HLASM semantics.

9.15.1 Options
--------------

The i386 version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`--32 | --x32 | --64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  `--32' implies
     Intel i386 architecture, while `--x32' and `--64' imply AMD x86-64
     architecture with 32-bit or 64-bit word-size respectively.

     These options are only available with the ELF object file format,
     and require that the necessary BFD support has been included (on a
     32-bit platform you have to add -enable-64-bit-bfd to configure
     enable 64-bit usage and use x86-64 as target platform).

`-n'
     By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for
     alignment within code sections with multi-byte nop instructions
     such as leal 0(%esi,1),%esi.  This switch disables the
     optimization.

`--divide'
     On SVR4-derived platforms, the character `/' is treated as a
     comment character, which means that it cannot be used in
     expressions.  The `--divide' option turns `/' into a normal
     character.  This does not disable `/' at the beginning of a line
     starting a comment, or affect using `#' for starting a comment.

`-march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
     instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The
     following processor names are recognized: `i8086', `i186', `i286',
     `i386', `i486', `i586', `i686', `pentium', `pentiumpro',
     `pentiumii', `pentiumiii', `pentium4', `prescott', `nocona',
     `core', `core2', `corei7', `l1om', `k1om', `k6', `k6_2', `athlon',
     `opteron', `k8', `amdfam10', `bdver1', `bdver2', `bdver3',
     `bdver4', `btver1', `btver2', `generic32' and `generic64'.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be
     told to accept various extension mnemonics.  For example,
     `-march=i686+sse4+vmx' extends I686 with SSE4 and VMX.  The
     following extensions are currently supported: `8087', `287', `387',
     `no87', `mmx', `nommx', `sse', `sse2', `sse3', `ssse3', `sse4.1',
     `sse4.2', `sse4', `nosse', `avx', `avx2', `adx', `rdseed',
     `prfchw', `smap', `mpx', `sha', `avx512f', `avx512cd', `avx512er',
     `avx512pf', `noavx', `vmx', `vmfunc', `smx', `xsave', `xsaveopt',
     `aes', `pclmul', `fsgsbase', `rdrnd', `f16c', `bmi2', `fma',
     `movbe', `ept', `lzcnt', `hle', `rtm', `invpcid', `clflush', `lwp',
     `fma4', `xop', `cx16', `syscall', `rdtscp', `3dnow', `3dnowa',
     `sse4a', `sse5', `svme', `abm' and `padlock'.  Note that rather
     than extending a basic instruction set, the extension mnemonics
     starting with `no' revoke the respective functionality.

     When the `.arch' directive is used with `-march', the `.arch'
     directive will take precedent.

`-mtune=CPU'
     This option specifies a processor to optimize for. When used in
     conjunction with the `-march' option, only instructions of the
     processor specified by the `-march' option will be generated.

     Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of
     `-march=CPU'.

`-msse2avx'
     This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE
     instructions with VEX prefix.

`-msse-check=NONE'
`-msse-check=WARNING'
`-msse-check=ERROR'
     These options control if the assembler should check SSE
     instructions.  `-msse-check=NONE' will make the assembler not to
     check SSE instructions,  which is the default.
     `-msse-check=WARNING' will make the assembler issue a warning for
     any SSE instruction.  `-msse-check=ERROR' will make the assembler
     issue an error for any SSE instruction.

`-mavxscalar=128'
`-mavxscalar=256'
     These options control how the assembler should encode scalar AVX
     instructions.  `-mavxscalar=128' will encode scalar AVX
     instructions with 128bit vector length, which is the default.
     `-mavxscalar=256' will encode scalar AVX instructions with 256bit
     vector length.

`-mevexlig=128'
`-mevexlig=256'
`-mevexlig=512'
     These options control how the assembler should encode
     length-ignored (LIG) EVEX instructions.  `-mevexlig=128' will
     encode LIG EVEX instructions with 128bit vector length, which is
     the default.  `-mevexlig=256' and `-mevexlig=512' will encode LIG
     EVEX instructions with 256bit and 512bit vector length,
     respectively.

`-mevexwig=0'
`-mevexwig=1'
     These options control how the assembler should encode w-ignored
     (WIG) EVEX instructions.  `-mevexwig=0' will encode WIG EVEX
     instructions with evex.w = 0, which is the default.  `-mevexwig=1'
     will encode WIG EVEX instructions with evex.w = 1.

`-mmnemonic=ATT'
`-mmnemonic=INTEL'
     This option specifies instruction mnemonic for matching
     instructions.  The `.att_mnemonic' and `.intel_mnemonic'
     directives will take precedent.

`-msyntax=ATT'
`-msyntax=INTEL'
     This option specifies instruction syntax when processing
     instructions.  The `.att_syntax' and `.intel_syntax' directives
     will take precedent.

`-mnaked-reg'
     This opetion specifies that registers don't require a `%' prefix.
     The `.att_syntax' and `.intel_syntax' directives will take
     precedent.

`-madd-bnd-prefix'
     This option forces the assembler to add BND prefix to all
     branches, even if such prefix was not explicitly specified in the
     source code.

`-mbig-obj'
     On x86-64 PE/COFF target this option forces the use of big object
     file format, which allows more than 32768 sections.

9.15.2 x86 specific Directives
------------------------------

`.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH[, ALIGNMENT]'
     Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
     denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of
     the new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss
     section, so that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  Since
     SYMBOL is not declared global, it is normally not visible to `ld'.
     The optional third parameter, ALIGNMENT, specifies the desired
     alignment of the symbol in the bss section.

     This directive is only available for COFF based x86 targets.

9.15.3.1 AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
........................................

`as' now supports assembly using Intel assembler syntax.
`.intel_syntax' selects Intel mode, and `.att_syntax' switches back to
the usual AT&T mode for compatibility with the output of `gcc'.  Either
of these directives may have an optional argument, `prefix', or
`noprefix' specifying whether registers require a `%' prefix.  AT&T
System V/386 assembler syntax is quite different from Intel syntax.  We
mention these differences because almost all 80386 documents use Intel
syntax.  Notable differences between the two syntaxes are:

   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by `$'; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel `push 4' is AT&T `pushl $4').
     AT&T register operands are preceded by `%'; Intel register operands
     are undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative)
     jump/call operands are prefixed by `*'; they are undelimited in
     Intel syntax.

   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel `add eax, 4' is `addl $4, %eax'.  The
     `source, dest' convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.  Note that `bound', `invlpga', and
     instructions with 2 immediate operands, such as the `enter'
     instruction, do _not_ have reversed order.  *note i386-Bugs::.

   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the instruction mnemonic.  Mnemonic suffixes of
     `b', `w', `l' and `q' specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), long
     (32-bit) and quadruple word (64-bit) memory references.  Intel
     syntax accomplishes this by prefixing memory operands (_not_ the
     instruction mnemonics) with `byte ptr', `word ptr', `dword ptr'
     and `qword ptr'.  Thus, Intel `mov al, byte ptr FOO' is `movb FOO,
     %al' in AT&T syntax.

     In 64-bit code, `movabs' can be used to encode the `mov'
     instruction with the 64-bit displacement or immediate operand.

   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are `lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET' in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is `call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET'.  Also, the far return instruction is `lret
     $STACK-ADJUST' in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is `ret far
     STACK-ADJUST'.

   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

9.15.3.2 Special Characters
...........................

The presence of a `#' appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   If the `--divide' command line option has not been specified then
the `/' character appearing anywhere on a line also introduces a line
comment.

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.15.4 Instruction Naming
-------------------------

Instruction mnemonics are suffixed with one character modifiers which
specify the size of operands.  The letters `b', `w', `l' and `q'
specify byte, word, long and quadruple word operands.  If no suffix is
specified by an instruction then `as' tries to fill in the missing
suffix based on the destination register operand (the last one by
convention).  Thus, `mov %ax, %bx' is equivalent to `movw %ax, %bx';
also, `mov $1, %bx' is equivalent to `movw $1, bx'.  Note that this is
incompatible with the AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing
mnemonic suffix implies long operand size.  (This incompatibility does
not affect compiler output since compilers always explicitly specify
the mnemonic suffix.)

   Almost all instructions have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend _from_ and a size to zero extend _to_.  This is
accomplished by using two instruction mnemonic suffixes in AT&T syntax.
Base names for sign extend and zero extend are `movs...' and `movz...'
in AT&T syntax (`movsx' and `movzx' in Intel syntax).  The instruction
mnemonic suffixes are tacked on to this base name, the _from_ suffix
before the _to_ suffix.  Thus, `movsbl %al, %edx' is AT&T syntax for
"move sign extend _from_ %al _to_ %edx."  Possible suffixes, thus, are
`bl' (from byte to long), `bw' (from byte to word), `wl' (from word to
long), `bq' (from byte to quadruple word), `wq' (from word to quadruple
word), and `lq' (from long to quadruple word).

   Different encoding options can be specified via optional mnemonic
suffix.  `.s' suffix swaps 2 register operands in encoding when moving
from one register to another.  `.d8' or `.d32' suffix prefers 8bit or
32bit displacement in encoding.

   The Intel-syntax conversion instructions

   * `cbw' -- sign-extend byte in `%al' to word in `%ax',

   * `cwde' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%eax',

   * `cwd' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%dx:%ax',

   * `cdq' -- sign-extend dword in `%eax' to quad in `%edx:%eax',

   * `cdqe' -- sign-extend dword in `%eax' to quad in `%rax' (x86-64
     only),

   * `cqo' -- sign-extend quad in `%rax' to octuple in `%rdx:%rax'
     (x86-64 only),

are called `cbtw', `cwtl', `cwtd', `cltd', `cltq', and `cqto' in AT&T
naming.  `as' accepts either naming for these instructions.

   Far call/jump instructions are `lcall' and `ljmp' in AT&T syntax,
but are `call far' and `jump far' in Intel convention.

9.15.5 AT&T Mnemonic versus Intel Mnemonic
------------------------------------------

`as' supports assembly using Intel mnemonic.  `.intel_mnemonic' selects
Intel mnemonic with Intel syntax, and `.att_mnemonic' switches back to
the usual AT&T mnemonic with AT&T syntax for compatibility with the
output of `gcc'.  Several x87 instructions, `fadd', `fdiv', `fdivp',
`fdivr', `fdivrp', `fmul', `fsub', `fsubp', `fsubr' and `fsubrp',  are
implemented in AT&T System V/386 assembler with different mnemonics
from those in Intel IA32 specification.  `gcc' generates those
instructions with AT&T mnemonic.

9.15.6 Register Naming
----------------------

Register operands are always prefixed with `%'.  The 80386 registers
consist of

   * the 8 32-bit registers `%eax' (the accumulator), `%ebx', `%ecx',
     `%edx', `%edi', `%esi', `%ebp' (the frame pointer), and `%esp'

     `%bx', `%cx', and `%dx')

   * the 6 section registers `%cs' (code section), `%ds' (data

9.15.7 Instruction Prefixes
---------------------------

Instruction prefixes are used to modify the following instruction.  They
are used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to change operand and address sizes.
(Most instructions that normally operate on 32-bit operands will use
16-bit operands if the instruction has an "operand size" prefix.)
Instruction prefixes are best written on the same line as the
instruction they act upon. For example, the `scas' (scan string)
instruction is repeated with:

             repne scas %es:(%edi),%al

   You may also place prefixes on the lines immediately preceding the
instruction, but this circumvents checks that `as' does with prefixes,
and will not work with all prefixes.

   Here is a list of instruction prefixes:

   * Section override prefixes `cs', `ds', `ss', `es', `fs', `gs'.
     These are automatically added by specifying using the
     SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND form for memory references.

   * Operand/Address size prefixes `data16' and `addr16' change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses, while `data32'
     and `addr32' change 16-bit ones (in a `.code16' section) into
     32-bit operands/addresses.  These prefixes _must_ appear on the
     same line of code as the instruction they modify. For example, in
     a 16-bit `.code16' section, you might write:

                  addr32 jmpl *(%ebx)

   * The bus lock prefix `lock' inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).

   * The wait for coprocessor prefix `wait' waits for the coprocessor to
     complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed for
     the 80386/80387 combination.

   * The `rep', `repe', and `repne' prefixes are added to string
     instructions to make them repeat `%ecx' times (`%cx' times if the
     current address size is 16-bits).  

   * The `rex' family of prefixes is used by x86-64 to encode
     extensions to i386 instruction set.  The `rex' prefix has four
     bits -- an operand size overwrite (`64') used to change operand
     size from 32-bit to 64-bit and X, Y and Z extensions bits used to
     extend the register set.

     You may write the `rex' prefixes directly. The `rex64xyz'
     instruction emits `rex' prefix with all the bits set.  By omitting
     the `64', `x', `y' or `z' you may write other prefixes as well.
     Normally, there is no need to write the prefixes explicitly, since
     gas will automatically generate them based on the instruction
     operands.

9.15.8 Memory References
------------------------

An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax _must_ be
preceded by a `%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, `as' does _not_ output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: `-4(%ebp)', Intel:  `[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is `%ebp'; DISP is `-4'. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (`%ss' for addressing with `%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: `foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: `[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is `%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is `foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to `%ds'.

AT&T: `foo(,1)'; Intel `[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by `foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only _one_ `,'.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: `%gs:foo'; Intel `gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable `foo' with section
     register SECTION being `%gs'.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with `*'.  If no `*' is specified, `as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand, but no register operand,
_must_ specify its size (byte, word, long, or quadruple) with an
instruction mnemonic suffix (`b', `w', `l' or `q', respectively).

   The x86-64 architecture adds an RIP (instruction pointer relative)
addressing.  This addressing mode is specified by using `rip' as a base
register.  Only constant offsets are valid. For example:

AT&T: `1234(%rip)', Intel: `[rip + 1234]'
     Points to the address 1234 bytes past the end of the current
     instruction.

AT&T: `symbol(%rip)', Intel: `[rip + symbol]'
     Points to the `symbol' in RIP relative way, this is shorter than
     the default absolute addressing.

   Other addressing modes remain unchanged in x86-64 architecture,
except registers used are 64-bit instead of 32-bit.

9.15.9 Handling of Jump Instructions
------------------------------------

Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long displacement is used.  We do not support word
(16-bit) displacement jumps in 32-bit mode (i.e. prefixing the jump
instruction with the `data16' instruction prefix), since the 80386
insists upon masking `%eip' to 16 bits after the word displacement is
added. (See also *note i386-Arch::)

   Note that the `jcxz', `jecxz', `loop', `loopz', `loope', `loopnz'
and `loopne' instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if
you use these instructions (`gcc' does not use them) you may get an
error message (and incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to
get around this problem by expanding `jcxz foo' to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

9.15.10 Floating Point
----------------------

All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.  (BCD
support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types are
16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double (64-bit),
and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each supported type
has an instruction mnemonic suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Instruction mnemonic suffixes specify the operand's data type.
Constructors build these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are `.float' or `.single', `.double',
     and `.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to instruction mnemonic suffixes `s', `l', and `t'. `t' stands for
     80-bit (ten byte) real.  The 80387 only supports this format via
     the `fldt' (load 80-bit real to stack top) and `fstpt' (store
     80-bit real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are `.word', `.long' or `.int', and `.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     instruction mnemonic suffixes are `s' (single), `l' (long), and
     `q' (quad).  As with the 80-bit real format, the 64-bit `q' format
     is only present in the `fildq' (load quad integer to stack top)
     and `fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations should not use instruction mnemonic
suffixes.  `fstl %st, %st(1)' will give a warning, and be assembled as
if you wrote `fst %st, %st(1)', since all register to register
operations use 80-bit floating point operands. (Contrast this with
`fstl %st, mem', which converts `%st' from 80-bit to 64-bit floating
point format, then stores the result in the 4 byte location `mem')

9.15.11 Intel's MMX and AMD's 3DNow! SIMD Operations
----------------------------------------------------

`as' supports Intel's MMX instruction set (SIMD instructions for
integer data), available on Intel's Pentium MMX processors and Pentium
II processors, AMD's K6 and K6-2 processors, Cyrix' M2 processor, and
probably others.  It also supports AMD's 3DNow!  instruction set (SIMD
instructions for 32-bit floating point data) available on AMD's K6-2
processor and possibly others in the future.

   Currently, `as' does not support Intel's floating point SIMD, Katmai
(KNI).

   The eight 64-bit MMX operands, also used by 3DNow!, are called
`%mm0', `%mm1', ... `%mm7'.  They contain eight 8-bit integers, four
16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, one 64-bit integer, or two 32-bit
floating point values.  The MMX registers cannot be used at the same
time as the floating point stack.

   See Intel and AMD documentation, keeping in mind that the operand
order in instructions is reversed from the Intel syntax.

9.15.12 AMD's Lightweight Profiling Instructions
------------------------------------------------

`as' supports AMD's Lightweight Profiling (LWP) instruction set,
available on AMD's Family 15h (Orochi) processors.

   LWP enables applications to collect and manage performance data, and
react to performance events.  The collection of performance data
requires no context switches.  LWP runs in the context of a thread and
so several counters can be used independently across multiple threads.
LWP can be used in both 64-bit and legacy 32-bit modes.

   For detailed information on the LWP instruction set, see the `AMD
Lightweight Profiling Specification' available at Lightweight Profiling
Specification (http://developer.amd.com/cpu/LWP).

9.15.13 Bit Manipulation Instructions

`as' supports the Bit Manipulation (BMI) instruction set.

   BMI instructions provide several instructions implementing individual
bit manipulation operations such as isolation, masking, setting, or
resetting.

9.15.14 AMD's Trailing Bit Manipulation Instructions
----------------------------------------------------

`as' supports AMD's Trailing Bit Manipulation (TBM) instruction set,
available on AMD's BDVER2 processors (Trinity and Viperfish).

   TBM instructions provide instructions implementing individual bit
manipulation operations such as isolating, masking, setting, resetting,
complementing, and operations on trailing zeros and ones.

9.15.15 Writing 16-bit Code
---------------------------

While `as' normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code or 64-bit
x86-64 code depending on the default configuration, it also supports
writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit protected mode code
segments.  To do this, put a `.code16' or `.code16gcc' directive before
the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.  You can
switch `as' to writing 32-bit code with the `.code32' directive or
64-bit code with the `.code64' directive.

   `.code16gcc' provides experimental support for generating 16-bit
code from gcc, and differs from `.code16' in that `call', `ret',
`enter', `leave', `push', `pop', `pusha', `popa', `pushf', and `popf'
instructions default to 32-bit size.  This is so that the stack pointer
is manipulated in the same way over function calls, allowing access to
function parameters at the same stack offsets as in 32-bit mode.
`.code16gcc' also automatically adds address size prefixes where
necessary to use the 32-bit addressing modes that gcc generates.

   The code which `as' generates in 16-bit mode will not necessarily
run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write code that runs on such a
processor, you must refrain from using _any_ 32-bit constructs which
require `as' to output address or operand size prefixes.

   Note that writing 16-bit code instructions by explicitly specifying a
prefix or an instruction mnemonic suffix within a 32-bit code section
generates different machine instructions than those generated for a
16-bit code segment.  In a 32-bit code section, the following code
generates the machine opcode bytes `66 6a 04', which pushes the value
`4' onto the stack, decrementing `%esp' by 2.

             pushw $4

   The same code in a 16-bit code section would generate the machine
opcode bytes `6a 04' (i.e., without the operand size prefix), which is
correct since the processor default operand size is assumed to be 16
bits in a 16-bit code section.

9.15.16 AT&T Syntax bugs
------------------------

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&T derived ix86 Unix
assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source
and destination registers in certain cases.  Unfortunately, gcc and
possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck
with it.

   For example

             fsub %st,%st(3)
   results in `%st(3)' being updated to `%st - %st(3)' rather than the
expected `%st(3) - %st'.  This happens with all the non-commutative
arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where
the source register is `%st' and the destination register is `%st(i)'.

9.15.17 Specifying CPU Architecture
-----------------------------------

`as' may be told to assemble for a particular CPU (sub-)architecture
with the `.arch CPU_TYPE' directive.  This directive enables a warning
when gas detects an instruction that is not supported on the CPU
specified.  The choices for CPU_TYPE are:

`i8086'        `i186'         `i286'         `i386'

`corei7'       `l1om'         `k1om'         
`k6'           `k6_2'         `athlon'       `k8'
`amdfam10'     `bdver1'       `bdver2'       `bdver3'

`.syscall'     `.rdtscp'      `.svme'        `.abm'
`.lwp'         `.fma4'        `.xop'         `.cx16'
`.padlock'

`.cx16'        `.padlock'                    

   Apart from the warning, there are only two other effects on `as'
operation;  Firstly, if you specify a CPU other than `i486', then shift
by one instructions such as `sarl $1, %eax' will automatically use a
two byte opcode sequence.  The larger three byte opcode sequence is
used on the 486 (and when no architecture is specified) because it
executes faster on the 486.  Note that you can explicitly request the
two byte opcode by writing `sarl %eax'.  Secondly, if you specify
`i8086', `i186', or `i286', _and_ `.code16' or `.code16gcc' then byte
offset conditional jumps will be promoted when necessary to a two
instruction sequence consisting of a conditional jump of the opposite
sense around an unconditional jump to the target.

   Following the CPU architecture (but not a sub-architecture, which
are those starting with a dot), you may specify `jumps' or `nojumps' to
control automatic promotion of conditional jumps. `jumps' is the
default, and enables jump promotion;  All external jumps will be of the
long variety, and file-local jumps will be promoted as necessary.
(*note i386-Jumps::)  `nojumps' leaves external conditional jumps as
byte offset jumps, and warns about file-local conditional jumps that
`as' promotes.  Unconditional jumps are treated as for `jumps'.

   For example

      .arch i8086,nojumps

9.15.18 Notes
-------------

There is some trickery concerning the `mul' and `imul' instructions
that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, 64- and 128-bit expanding
multiplies (base opcode `0xf6'; extension 4 for `mul' and 5 for `imul')
can be output only in the one operand form.  Thus, `imul %ebx, %eax'
does _not_ select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would
clobber the `%edx' register, and this would confuse `gcc' output.  Use
`imul %ebx' to get the 64-bit product in `%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of `imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying `%eax' by 69, for
example, can be done with `imul $69, %eax' rather than `imul $69, %eax,
%eax'.

9.16.1 i860 Notes
-----------------

This is a fairly complete i860 assembler which is compatible with the
UNIX System V/860 Release 4 assembler. However, it does not currently
support SVR4 PIC (i.e., `@GOT, @GOTOFF, @PLT').

   Like the SVR4/860 assembler, the output object format is ELF32.
Currently, this is the only supported object format. If there is
sufficient interest, other formats such as COFF may be implemented.

   Both the Intel and AT&T/SVR4 syntaxes are supported, with the latter
being the default.  One difference is that AT&T syntax requires the '%'
prefix on register names while Intel syntax does not.  Another
difference is in the specification of relocatable expressions.  The
Intel syntax is `ha%expression' whereas the SVR4 syntax is
`[expression]@ha' (and similarly for the "l" and "h" selectors).

     larger than 16-bits will be expanded into two instructions. This
     is a very undesirable feature to rely on, so this flag can help
     detect any code where it happens. One use of it, for instance, has
     been to find and eliminate any place where `gcc' may emit these
     pseudo-instructions.

`-mxp'
     Enable support for the i860XP instructions and control registers.
     By default, this option is disabled so that only the base
     instruction set (i.e., i860XR) is supported.

`-mintel-syntax'
     The i860 assembler defaults to AT&T/SVR4 syntax.  This option
     enables the Intel syntax.

9.16.3 i860 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.dual'
     Enter dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.enddual'
     Exit dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.atmp'
     Change the temporary register used when expanding pseudo
     operations. The default register is `r31'.

   The `.dual', `.enddual', and `.atmp' directives are available only
in the Intel syntax mode.

   Both syntaxes allow for the standard `.align' directive.  However,
the Intel syntax additionally allows keywords for the alignment
parameter: "`.align type'", where `type' is one of `.short', `.long',
`.quad', `.single', `.double' representing alignments of 2, 4, 16, 4,
and 8, respectively.

9.16.4.1 Other instruction support (pseudo-instructions)
........................................................

For compatibility with some other i860 assemblers, a number of
pseudo-instructions are supported. While these are supported, they are
a very undesirable feature that should be avoided - in particular, when
they result in an expansion to multiple actual i860 instructions. Below
are the pseudo-instructions that result in expansions.
   * Load large immediate into general register:

     The pseudo-instruction `mov imm,%rn' (where the immediate does not
     fit within a signed 16-bit field) will be expanded into:
          orh large_imm@h,%r0,%rn
          or large_imm@l,%rn,%rn

   * Load/store with relocatable address expression:

     For example, the pseudo-instruction `ld.b addr_exp(%rx),%rn' will
     be expanded into:
          orh addr_exp@ha,%rx,%r31
          ld.l addr_exp@l(%r31),%rn

     The analogous expansions apply to `ld.x, st.x, fld.x, pfld.x,
     fst.x', and `pst.x' as well.

   * Signed large immediate with add/subtract:

     If any of the arithmetic operations `adds, addu, subs, subu' are
     used with an immediate larger than 16-bits (signed), then they
     will be expanded.  For instance, the pseudo-instruction `adds
     large_imm,%rx,%rn' expands to:
          orh large_imm@h,%r0,%r31
          or large_imm@l,%r31,%r31
          adds %r31,%rx,%rn

   * Unsigned large immediate with logical operations:

     Logical operations (`or, andnot, or, xor') also result in
     expansions.  The pseudo-instruction `or large_imm,%rx,%rn' results
     in:
          orh large_imm@h,%rx,%r31
          or large_imm@l,%r31,%rn

     Similarly for the others, except for `and' which expands to:
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@h,%rx,%r31
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@l,%r31,%rn

9.17.1 i960 Command-line Options
--------------------------------

`-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC'
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

     `-ACA' is equivalent to `-ACA_A'; `-AKC' is equivalent to `-AMC'.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, `as' generates code
     for any instruction or feature that is supported by _some_ version
     of the 960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In
     principle, `as' attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient
     processor type if none is specified; depending on the object code
     format, the processor type may be recorded in the object file.  If
     it is critical that the `as' output match a specific architecture,
     specify that architecture explicitly.

`-b'
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when `-b' is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was _not_ taken; the difference between the two counters is
     the number of times the branch _was_ taken.

     A table of every such `Label' is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor `gbr960' (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labeled `__BRANCH_TABLE__';
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           |  *NEXT     |  COUNT: N  | *BRLAB 1   |     | *BRLAB N   |
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+

                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a `-b' option.
     For further details, see the documentation of `gbr960'.

`-no-relax'
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or `chkbit') and
     branch instructions.  You can use the `-no-relax' option to
     specify that `as' should generate errors instead, if the target
     displacement is larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is _always_ adjusted when necessary
     (depending on displacement size), regardless of whether you use
     `-no-relax'.

9.17.3 i960 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

`.extended FLONUMS'
     `.extended' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, `.extended' emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

`.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB'
     You can use the `.leafproc' directive in conjunction with the
     optimized `callj' instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using `.leafproc'.  If the procedure
     also has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you
     can specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A `.leafproc' declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction `callj'; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the `callj' into a `bal'
     or a `call'.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the `bal' entry point.

`.sysproc NAME, INDEX'
     The `.sysproc' directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using `.sysproc', you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction `callj'.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

9.17.4.1 `callj'
................

You can write `callj' to have the assembler or the linker determine the
most appropriate form of subroutine call: `call', `bal', or `calls'.
If the assembly source contains enough information--a `.leafproc' or
`.sysproc' directive defining the operand--then `as' translates the
`callj'; if not, it simply emits the `callj', leaving it for the linker
to resolve.

9.17.4.2 Compare-and-Branch
...........................

The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch instructions
that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13 bits of the
instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch target far
enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the assembler can
either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch instruction
into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether `as' gives an error or expands the instruction depends on
two choices you can make: whether you use the `-no-relax' option, and
whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and
Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are _always_ expanded if
necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary
_unless_ you specify `-no-relax'--in which case `as' gives an error
instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

             Compare and
          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

9.18.1 Options
--------------

`-mconstant-gp'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP" model.  With this model, it is
     assumed that the entire program uses a single global pointer (GP)
     value.  Note that this option does not in any fashion affect the
     machine code emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-mauto-pic'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP without function descriptor" data
     model.  This model is like the "constant GP" model, except that it
     additionally does away with function descriptors.  What this means
     is that the address of a function refers directly to the
     function's code entry-point.  Normally, such an address would
     refer to a function descriptor, which contains both the code
     entry-point and the GP-value needed by the function.  Note that
     this option does not in any fashion affect the machine code
     emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_NOFUNCDESC_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-milp32'
`-milp64'
`-mlp64'
`-mp64'
     These options select the data model.  The assembler defaults to
     `-mlp64' (LP64 data model).

`-mle'
`-mbe'
     These options select the byte order.  The `-mle' option selects
     little-endian byte order (default) and `-mbe' selects big-endian
     byte order.  Note that IA-64 machine code always uses
     little-endian byte order.

`-mtune=itanium1'
`-mtune=itanium2'
     Tune for a particular IA-64 CPU, ITANIUM1 or ITANIUM2. The default
     is ITANIUM2.

`-munwind-check=warning'
`-munwind-check=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when performing
     consistency checks on unwind directives.  `-munwind-check=warning'
     will make the assembler issue a warning when an unwind directive
     check fails.  This is the default.  `-munwind-check=error' will
     make the assembler issue an error when an unwind directive check
     fails.

`-mhint.b=ok'
`-mhint.b=warning'
`-mhint.b=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when the `hint.b'
     instruction is used.  `-mhint.b=ok' will make the assembler accept
     `hint.b'.  `-mint.b=warning' will make the assembler issue a
     warning when `hint.b' is used.  `-mhint.b=error' will make the
     assembler treat `hint.b' as an error, which is the default.

`-x'
`-xexplicit'
     These options turn on dependency violation checking.

`-xauto'
     This option instructs the assembler to automatically insert stop
     bits where necessary to remove dependency violations.  This is the
     default mode.

`-xnone'
     This option turns off dependency violation checking.

`-xdebug'
     This turns on debug output intended to help tracking down bugs in
     the dependency violation checker.

`-xdebugn'
     This is a shortcut for -xnone -xdebug.

`-xdebugx'
     This is a shortcut for -xexplicit -xdebug.

referred to as `crN'.  The 64 one-bit predicate registers are referred
to as `pN'.  The 8 branch registers are referred to as `bN'.  In
addition, the assembler defines a number of aliases: `gp' (`r1'), `sp'
(`r12'), `rp' (`b0'), `ret0' (`r8'), `ret1' (`r9'), `ret2' (`r10'),
`ret3' (`r9'), `fargN' (`f8+N'), and `fretN' (`f8+N').

   For convenience, the assembler also defines aliases for all named
application and control registers.  For example, `ar.bsp' refers to the
register backing store pointer (`ar17').  Similarly, `cr.eoi' refers to
the end-of-interrupt register (`cr67').

9.20.2.2 Relocatable Expression Modifiers
.........................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using relocatable
addresses in LM32 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     modifier(relocatable-expression)

`lo'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 15 of an address
     expression as 16 bit relocatable expression.

`hi'
     This modifier allows you to use bits 16 through 23 of an address
     expression as 16 bit relocatable expression.

     For example

          ori  r4, r4, lo(sym+10)
          orhi r4, r4, hi(sym+10)

`gp'
     This modified creates a 16-bit relocatable expression that is the
     offset of the symbol from the global pointer.

          mva r4, gp(sym)

`got'
     This modifier places a symbol in the GOT and creates a 16-bit
     relocatable expression that is the offset into the GOT of this
     symbol.

          lw r4, (gp+got(sym))

`gotofflo16'
     This modifier allows you to use the bits 0 through 15 of an
     address which is an offset from the GOT.

`gotoffhi16'
     This modifier allows you to use the bits 16 through 31 of an
     address which is an offset from the GOT.

          orhi r4, r4, gotoffhi16(lsym)
          addi r4, r4, gotofflo16(lsym)

9.21.2.1 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
...................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
M32C instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%dsp8'
`%dsp16'
     These modifiers override the assembler's assumptions about how big
     a symbol's address is.  Normally, when it sees an operand like
     `sym[a0]' it assumes `sym' may require the widest displacement
     field (16 bits for `-m16c', 24 bits for `-m32c').  These modifiers
     tell it to assume the address will fit in an 8 or 16 bit
     (respectively) unsigned displacement.  Note that, of course, if it
     doesn't actually fit you will get linker errors.  Example:

          mov.w %dsp8(sym)[a0],r1
          mov.b #0,%dsp8(sym)[a0]

`%hi8'
     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 23 of a 24 bit
     address into an 8 bit register.  This is useful with, for example,
     the M16C `smovf' instruction, which expects a 20 bit address in
     `r1h' and `a0'.  Example:

          mov.b #%hi8(sym),r1h
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          smovf.b

`%lo16'
     Likewise, this modifier allows you to load bits 0 through 15 of a
     24 bit address into a 16 bit register.

`%hi16'
     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 31 of a 32 bit
     address into a 16 bit register.  While the M32C family only has 24
     bits of address space, it does support addresses in pairs of 16 bit
     registers (like `a1a0' for the `lde' instruction).  This modifier
     is for loading the upper half in such cases.  Example:

          mov.w #%hi16(sym),a1
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          ...
          lde.w [a1a0],r1

9.21.2.2 Special Characters
...........................

The presence of a `;' character on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `|' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.22.1 M32R Options
-------------------

The Renease M32R version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-m32rx'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Renesas M32R family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for
     the M32R microprocessor.  This option may be used to change the
     default to the M32RX microprocessor, which adds some more
     instructions to the basic M32R instruction set, and some
     additional parameters to some of the original instructions.

`-m32r2'
     This option changes the target processor to the M32R2
     microprocessor.

`-m32r'
     This option can be used to restore the assembler's default
     behaviour of assembling for the M32R microprocessor.  This can be
     useful if the default has been changed by a previous command line
     option.

`-little'
     This option tells the assembler to produce little-endian code and
     data.  The default is dependent upon how the toolchain was
     configured.

`-EL'
     This is a synonym for _-little_.

`-big'
     This option tells the assembler to produce big-endian code and
     data.

`-EB'
     This is a synonum for _-big_.

`-KPIC'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

`-parallel'
     This option tells the assembler to attempts to combine two
     sequential instructions into a single, parallel instruction, where
     it is legal to do so.

`-no-parallel'
     This option disables a previously enabled _-parallel_ option.

`-no-bitinst'
     This option disables the support for the extended bit-field
     instructions provided by the M32R2.  If this support needs to be
     re-enabled the _-bitinst_ switch can be used to restore it.

`-O'
     This option tells the assembler to attempt to optimize the
     instructions that it produces.  This includes filling delay slots
     and converting sequential instructions into parallel ones.  This
     option implies _-parallel_.

`-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.  This option is enabled by
     default, but `gcc' disables it when it invokes `as' directly.
     Questionable instructions are those whose behaviour would be
     different if they were executed sequentially.  For example the
     code fragment `mv r1, r2 || mv r3, r1' produces a different result
     from `mv r1, r2 \n mv r3, r1' since the former moves r1 into r3
     and then r2 into r1, whereas the later moves r2 into r1 and r3.

`-Wp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' not to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.

`-Wnp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option tells the assembler's to stop checking parallel
     instructions for constraint violations.  This ability is provided
     for hardware vendors testing chip designs and should not be used
     under normal circumstances.

`-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option restores the assembler's default behaviour of checking
     parallel instructions to detect constraint violations.

`-Ip'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-nIp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-warn-unmatched-high'
     This option tells the assembler to produce a warning message if a
     `.high' pseudo op is encountered without a matching `.low' pseudo
     op.  The presence of such an unmatched pseudo op usually indicates
     a programming error.

`-no-warn-unmatched-high'
     Disables a previously enabled _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wnuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

9.22.2 M32R Directives
----------------------

The Renease M32R version of `as' has a few architecture specific
directives:

`low EXPRESSION'
     The `low' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the lower 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = r0 | 0x5678
             add3, r0, r0, #low(fred)   ; compute r0 = r0 + low 16-bits of address of fred

`high EXPRESSION'
     The `high' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the upper 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             seth  r0, #high(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth, r0, #high(fred)       ; compute r0 = upper 16-bits of address of fred

`shigh EXPRESSION'
     The `shigh' directive is very similar to the `high' directive.  It
     also computes the value of its expression and places the upper
     16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of the instruction.
     The difference is that `shigh' also checks to see if the lower
     16-bits could be interpreted as a signed number, and if so it
     assumes that a borrow will occur from the upper-16 bits.  To
     compensate for this the `shigh' directive pre-biases the upper 16
     bit value by adding one to it.  For example:

     For example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000) ; compute r0 = 0x00010000

     In the second example the lower 16-bits are 0x8000.  If these are
     treated as a signed value and sign extended to 32-bits then the
     value becomes 0xffff8000.  If this value is then added to
     0x00010000 then the result is 0x00008000.

     This behaviour is to allow for the different semantics of the
     `or3' and `add3' instructions.  The `or3' instruction treats its
     16-bit immediate argument as unsigned whereas the `add3' treats
     its 16-bit immediate as a signed value.  So for example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             add3  r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Produces the correct result in r0, whereas:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Stores 0xffff8000 into r0.

     Note - the `shigh' directive does not know where in the assembly
     source code the lower 16-bits of the value are going set, so it
     cannot check to make sure that an `or3' instruction is being used
     rather than an `add3' instruction.  It is up to the programmer to
     make sure that correct directives are used.

`.m32r'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to only accept M32R instructions
     from now on.  An instructions from later M32R architectures are
     refused.

`.m32rx'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32rx_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32RX ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.m32r2'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r2_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32R2 ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.little'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-little_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start producing
     little-endian code and data.  This option should be used with care
     as producing mixed-endian binary files is fraught with danger.

`.big'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-big_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start producing big-endian code
     and data.  This option should be used with care as producing
     mixed-endian binary files is fraught with danger.

9.22.3 M32R Warnings
--------------------

There are several warning and error messages that can be produced by
`as' which are specific to the M32R:

`output of 1st instruction is the same as an input to 2nd instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the left hand instruction is used as an input register
     in the right hand instruction.  For example in this code fragment
     `mv r1, r2 || neg r3, r1' register r1 is the destination of the
     move instruction and the input to the neg instruction.

`output of 2nd instruction is the same as an input to 1st instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the right hand instruction is used as an input
     register in the left hand instruction.  For example in this code
     fragment `mv r1, r2 || neg r2, r3' register r2 is the destination
     of the neg instruction and the input to the move instruction.

`instruction `...' is for the M32RX only'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which is only supported by the M32Rx processor, and
     the `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified to allow
     assembly of such instructions.

`unknown instruction `...''
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which it does not recognize.

`only the NOP instruction can be issued in parallel on the m32r'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which does not involve a NOP instruction and the
     `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified.  Only the M32Rx
     processor is able to execute two instructions in parallel.

`instruction `...' cannot be executed in parallel.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which is made up of one or two instructions which
     cannot be executed in parallel.

`Instructions share the same execution pipeline'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction whoes components both use the same execution pipeline.

`Instructions write to the same destination register.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction where both components attempt to modify the same
     register.  For example these code fragments will produce this
     message: `mv r1, r2 || neg r1, r3' `jl r0 || mv r14, r1' `st r2,
     @-r1 || mv r1, r3' `mv r1, r2 || ld r0, @r1+' `cmp r1, r2 || addx
     r3, r4' (Both write to the condition bit)

9.23.1 M680x0 Options
---------------------

The Motorola 680x0 version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-march=ARCHITECTURE'
     This option specifies a target architecture.  The following
     architectures are recognized: `68000', `68010', `68020', `68030',
     `68040', `68060', `cpu32', `isaa', `isaaplus', `isab', `isac' and
     `cfv4e'.

`-mcpu=CPU'
     This option specifies a target cpu.  When used in conjunction with
     the `-march' option, the cpu must be within the specified
     architecture.  Also, the generic features of the architecture are
     used for instruction generation, rather than those of the specific
     chip.

`-m[no-]68851'
`-m[no-]68881'
`-m[no-]div'
`-m[no-]usp'
`-m[no-]float'
`-m[no-]mac'
`-m[no-]emac'
     Enable or disable various architecture specific features.  If a
     chip or architecture by default supports an option (for instance
     `-march=isaaplus' includes the `-mdiv' option), explicitly
     disabling the option will override the default.

`-l'
     You can use the `-l' option to shorten the size of references to
     undefined symbols.  If you do not use the `-l' option, references
     to undefined symbols are wide enough for a full `long' (32 bits).
     (Since `as' cannot know where these symbols end up, `as' can only
     allocate space for the linker to fill in later.  Since `as' does
     not know how far away these symbols are, it allocates as much
     space as it can.)  If you use this option, the references are only
     one word wide (16 bits).  This may be useful if you want the
     object file to be as small as possible, and you know that the
     relevant symbols are always less than 17 bits away.

`--register-prefix-optional'
     For some configurations, especially those where the compiler
     normally does not prepend an underscore to the names of user
     variables, the assembler requires a `%' before any use of a
     register name.  This is intended to let the assembler distinguish
     between C variables and functions named `a0' through `a7', and so
     on.  The `%' is always accepted, but is not required for certain
     configurations, notably `sun3'.  The `--register-prefix-optional'
     option may be used to permit omitting the `%' even for
     configurations for which it is normally required.  If this is
     done, it will generally be impossible to refer to C variables and
     functions with the same names as register names.

`--bitwise-or'
     Normally the character `|' is treated as a comment character, which
     means that it can not be used in expressions.  The `--bitwise-or'
     option turns `|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
     either use C style comments, or start comments with a `#' character
     at the beginning of a line.

`--base-size-default-16  --base-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a base register without
     specifying the size, `as' will normally use the full 32 bit value.
     For example, the addressing mode `%a0@(%d0)' is equivalent to
     `%a0@(%d0:l)'.  You may use the `--base-size-default-16' option to
     tell `as' to default to using the 16 bit value.  In this case,
     `%a0@(%d0)' is equivalent to `%a0@(%d0:w)'.  You may use the
     `--base-size-default-32' option to restore the default behaviour.

`--disp-size-default-16  --disp-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value
     of the displacement is not known, `as' will normally assume that
     the value is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol `disp' has not
     been defined, `as' will assemble the addressing mode
     `%a0@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 32 bit value.  You may use
     the `--disp-size-default-16' option to tell `as' to instead assume
     that the displacement is 16 bits.  In this case, `as' will
     assemble `%a0@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 16 bit value.  You
     may use the `--disp-size-default-32' option to restore the default
     behaviour.

`--pcrel'
     Always keep branches PC-relative.  In the M680x0 architecture all
     branches are defined as PC-relative.  However, on some processors
     they are limited to word displacements maximum.  When `as' needs a
     long branch that is not available, it normally emits an absolute
     jump instead.  This option disables this substitution.  When this
     option is given and no long branches are available, only word
     branches will be emitted.  An error message will be generated if a
     word branch cannot reach its target.  This option has no effect on
     68020 and other processors that have long branches.  *note Branch
     Improvement: M68K-Branch.

`-m68000'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Motorola 680x0 family.  The default depends upon how `as' was
     configured when it was built; normally, the default is to assemble
     code for the 68020 microprocessor.  The following options may be
     used to change the default.  These options control which
     instructions and addressing modes are permitted.  The members of
     the 680x0 family are very similar.  For detailed information about
     the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

    `-m68000'
    `-m68ec000'
    `-m68hc000'
    `-m68hc001'
    `-m68008'

    `-m68306'
    `-m68307'
    `-m68322'
    `-m68356'
          Assemble for the 68000. `-m68008', `-m68302', and so on are
          synonyms for `-m68000', since the chips are the same from the
          point of view of the assembler.

    `-m68010'
          Assemble for the 68010.

    `-m68020'
    `-m68ec020'
          Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

    `-m68030'
    `-m68ec030'
          Assemble for the 68030.

    `-m68881'
    `-m68882'
          Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the
          default for the 68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and
          68060 always support floating point instructions.

    `-mno-68881'
          Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is
          the default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060
          always support floating point instructions, even if this
          option is used.

    `-m68851'
          Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
          68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
          different set of MMU instructions; `-m68851' and `-m68040'
          should not be used together.

    `-mno-68851'
          Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default
          for the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a
          somewhat different set of MMU instructions.

9.23.2 Syntax
-------------

This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of `as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, `movl' is equivalent to `mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), a suppressed address register
(`%za0' through `%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of
SIZE means one of `w' or `l', and it may be omitted, along with the
leading colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE
means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be omitted along
with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     `%d0' through `%d7'

"Address Register"
     `%a0' through `%a7'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e., the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     `%a0@' through `%a7@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `%a0@+' through `%a7@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `%a0@-' through `%a7@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `APC@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     `APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     `APC@(NUMBER)@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     `APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS', optionally followed by `:b', `:w', or `:l'.

9.23.3 Motorola Syntax
----------------------

The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  `as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register (`%za0' through `%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of `w' or
`l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     `(%a0)' through `(%a7)'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e., the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `(%a0)+' through `(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `-(%a0)' through `-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `NUMBER(%A0)' through `NUMBER(%A7)', or `NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     `(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     `NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

"Postindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'

`.extend'
`.ldouble'
     `Extended' precision (`long double') floating point constants.

9.23.5 680x0 Machine Directives
-------------------------------

In order to be compatible with the Sun assembler the 680x0 assembler
understands the following directives.

`.data1'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 1' directive.

`.data2'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 2' directive.

`.even'
     This directive is a special case of the `.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

`.skip'
     This directive is identical to a `.space' directive.

`.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture and extension features.  Valid
     values for NAME are the same as for the `-march' command line
     option.  This directive cannot be specified after any instructions
     have been assembled.  If it is given multiple times, or in
     conjunction with the `-march' option, all uses must be for the
     same architecture and extension set.

`.cpu NAME'
     Select the target cpu.  Valid valuse for NAME are the same as for
     the `-mcpu' command line option.  This directive cannot be
     specified after any instructions have been assembled.  If it is
     given multiple times, or in conjunction with the `-mopt' option,
     all uses must be for the same cpu.

9.23.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting `j' for `b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A `*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +------------------------------------------------------------
               |                68020           68000/10, not PC-relative OK
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG            ABSOLUTE LONG JUMP    **
               +------------------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsrw    bsrl            jsr
           jra |bras    braw    bral            jmp
     *     jXX |bXXs    bXXw    bXXl            bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX | N/A    dbXXw   dbXX;bras;bral  dbXX;bras;jmp
          fjXX | N/A    fbXXw   fbXXl            N/A

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX
                       `*'--see full description below
         `**'--this expansion mode is disallowed by `--pcrel'

`jbsr'
`jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.  This instruction will be a byte or word
     branch is that is sufficient.  Otherwise, a long branch will be
     emitted if available.  If no long branches are available and the
     `--pcrel' option is not given, an absolute long jump will be
     emitted instead.  If no long branches are available, the `--pcrel'
     option is given, and a word branch cannot reach the target, an
     error message is generated.

     In addition to standard branch operands, `as' allows these
     pseudo-operations to have all operands that are allowed for jsr
     and jmp, substituting these instructions if the operand given is
     not valid for a branch instruction.

`jXX'
     Here, `jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     Usually, each of these pseudo-operations expands to a single branch
     instruction.  However, if a word branch is not sufficient, no long
     branches are available, and the `--pcrel' option is not given, `as'
     issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX, the opposite
     condition to XX.  For example, under these conditions:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

`dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Motorola `dbXX' instructions allow word displacements only.  When
     a word displacement is sufficient, each of these pseudo-operations
     expands to the corresponding Motorola instruction.  When a word
     displacement is not sufficient and long branches are available,
     when the source reads `dbXX foo', `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:bral foo
           oo2:

     If, however, long branches are not available and the `--pcrel'
     option is not given, `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:jmp foo
           oo2:

`fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt
           fjnle  fjnlt  fjoge  fjogl  fjogt  fjole  fjolt
           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     Each of these pseudo-operations always expands to a single Motorola
     coprocessor branch instruction, word or long.  All Motorola
     coprocessor branch instructions allow both word and long
     displacements.

9.23.6.2 Special Characters
...........................

Line comments are introduced by the `|' character appearing anywhere on
a line, unless the `--bitwise-or' command line option has been
specified.

   An asterisk (`*') as the first character on a line marks the start
of a line comment as well.

   A hash character (`#') as the first character on a line also marks
the start of a line comment, but in this case it could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).  If the hash character appears
elsewhere on a line it is used to introduce an immediate value.  (This
is for compatibility with Sun's assembler).

   Multiple statements on the same line can appear if they are separated
by the `;' character.

9.24.1 M68HC11 and M68HC12 Options
----------------------------------

The Motorola 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.

`-m68hc11'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HC11 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler only accepts 68HC11 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC11.

`-m68hc12'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HC12 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler also accepts 68HC12 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC12. A few 68HC11 instructions are
     replaced by some 68HC12 instructions as recommended by Motorola
     specifications.

`-m68hcs12'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HCS12 mode.  This
     mode is similar to `-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     68HCS12 series.  The only difference is on the assembling of the
     `movb' and `movw' instruction when a PC-relative operand is used.

`-mm9s12x'
     This option switches the assembler into the M9S12X mode.  This
     mode is similar to `-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     S12X series which is a superset of the HCS12.

`-mm9s12xg'
     This option switches the assembler into the XGATE mode for the RISC
     co-processor featured on some S12X-family chips.

`--xgate-ramoffset'
     This option instructs the linker to offset RAM addresses from S12X
     address space into XGATE address space.

`-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

`-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

`-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  This is the default.

`-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

`--strict-direct-mode'
     You can use the `--strict-direct-mode' option to disable the
     automatic translation of direct page mode addressing into extended
     mode when the instruction does not support direct mode.  For
     example, the `clr' instruction does not support direct page mode
     addressing. When it is used with the direct page mode, `as' will
     ignore it and generate an absolute addressing.  This option
     prevents `as' from doing this, and the wrong usage of the direct
     page mode will raise an error.

`--short-branches'
     The `--short-branches' option turns off the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches when the branch offset is
     out of range. By default `as' transforms the relative branch
     (`bsr', `bgt', `bge', `beq', `bne', `ble', `blt', `bhi', `bcc',
     `bls', `bcs', `bmi', `bvs', `bvs', `bra') into an absolute branch
     when the offset is out of the -128 .. 127 range.  In that case,
     the `bsr' instruction is translated into a `jsr', the `bra'
     instruction is translated into a `jmp' and the conditional
     branches instructions are inverted and followed by a `jmp'. This
     option disables these translations and `as' will generate an error
     if a relative branch is out of range. This option does not affect
     the optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and `jbXX'
     pseudo opcodes.

`--force-long-branches'
     The `--force-long-branches' option forces the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches. This option does not
     affect the optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and
     `jbXX' pseudo opcodes.

`--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the `--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

`--print-opcodes'
     The `--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax. The first item of each line
     represents the instruction name and the rest of the line indicates
     the possible operands for that instruction. The list is printed in
     alphabetical order. Once the list is printed `as' exits.

`--generate-example'
     The `--generate-example' option is similar to `--print-opcodes'
     but it generates an example for each instruction instead.

9.24.2 Syntax
-------------

In the M68HC11 syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by one or several operands (up to three). Operands are
separated by comma (`,'). In the normal mode, `as' will complain if too
many operands are specified for a given instruction. In the MRI mode
(turned on with `-M' option), it will treat them as comments. Example:

     inx
     lda  #23
     bset 2,x #4
     brclr *bot #8 foo

   The presence of a `;' character or a `!' character anywhere on a
line indicates the start of a comment that extends to the end of that
line.

   A `*' or a `#' character at the start of a line also introduces a
line comment, but these characters do not work elsewhere on the line.
If the first character of the line is a `#' then as well as starting a
comment, the line could also be logical line number directive (*note
Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The M68HC11 assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

   The following addressing modes are understood for 68HC11 and 68HC12:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Address Register"
     `NUMBER,X', `NUMBER,Y'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.

"Direct Addressing mode"
     `*SYMBOL', or `*DIGITS'

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS'

   The M68HC12 has other more complex addressing modes. All of them are
supported and they are represented below:

"Constant Offset Indexed Addressing Mode"
     `NUMBER,REG'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.  The assembler will
     use the smaller post-byte definition according to the constant
     value (5-bit constant offset, 9-bit constant offset or 16-bit
     constant offset).  If the constant is not known by the assembler
     it will use the 16-bit constant offset post-byte and the value
     will be resolved at link time.

"Offset Indexed Indirect"
     `[NUMBER,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Auto Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement/Post-Increment/Post-Decrement"
     `NUMBER,-REG' `NUMBER,+REG' `NUMBER,REG-' `NUMBER,REG+'

     The number must be in the range `-8'..`+8' and must not be 0.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator Offset"
     `ACC,REG'

     The accumulator register can be either `A', `B' or `D'.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator D offset indexed-indirect"
     `[D,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.


   For example:

     ldab 1024,sp
     ldd [10,x]
     orab 3,+x
     stab -2,y-
     ldx a,pc
     sty [d,sp]

9.24.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%addr'
     This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use the
     16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is
     intended to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in
     the memory bank window.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion
     part, the physical address corresponds to the symbol address
     within the memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory
     expansion part, this is the symbol address (using or not using the
     %addr modifier has no effect in that case).

`%page'
     This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
     to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its
     page number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the
     page containing the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the
     symbol is not in a memory expansion part, the page number is 0.

`%hi'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
     address of the symbol.

`%lo'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
     address of the symbol.


   For example a 68HC12 call to a function `foo_example' stored in
memory expansion part could be written as follows:

     call %addr(foo_example),%page(foo_example)

   and this is equivalent to

     call foo_example

   And for 68HC11 it could be written as follows:

     ldab #%page(foo_example)
     stab _page_switch
     jsr  %addr(foo_example)

9.24.4 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have the following specific
assembler directives:

`.relax'
     The relax directive is used by the `GNU Compiler' to emit a
     specific relocation to mark a group of instructions for linker
     relaxation.  The sequence of instructions within the group must be
     known to the linker so that relaxation can be performed.

`.mode [mshort|mlong|mshort-double|mlong-double]'
     This directive specifies the ABI.  It overrides the `-mshort',
     `-mlong', `-mshort-double' and `-mlong-double' options.

`.far SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as a `far' symbol meaning that it
     uses a `call/rtc' calling convention as opposed to `jsr/rts'.
     During a final link, the linker will identify references to the
     `far' symbol and will verify the proper calling convention.

`.interrupt SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as an interrupt entry point.  This
     information is then used by the debugger to correctly unwind the
     frame across interrupts.

`.xrefb SYMBOL'
     This directive is defined for compatibility with the
     `Specification for Motorola 8 and 16-Bit Assembly Language Input
     Standard' and is ignored.

9.24.5 Floating Point
---------------------

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

`.extend'
`.ldouble'
     `Extended' precision (`long double') floating point constants.

9.24.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by prepending `j' to the start of
Motorola mnemonic. These pseudo opcodes are not affected by the
`--short-branches' or `--force-long-branches' options.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.

          +--------------------------+----------------------------------+
     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

`jbsr'
`jbra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

`jbXX'
     Here, `jbXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jbcc   jbeq   jbge   jbgt   jbhi   jbvs   jbpl  jblo
           jbcs   jbne   jblt   jble   jbls   jbvc   jbmi

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements, `as' issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX,
     the opposite condition to XX.  For example, for the non-PC
     relative case:
              jbXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

9.27.1 Assembler options
------------------------

The MIPS configurations of GNU `as' support these special options:

`-G NUM'
     Set the "small data" limit to N bytes.  The default limit is 8
     bytes.  *Note Controlling the use of small data accesses: MIPS
     Small Data.

`-EB'
`-EL'
     Any MIPS configuration of `as' can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use `-EB'
     to select big-endian output, and `-EL' for little-endian.

`-KPIC'
     Generate SVR4-style PIC.  This option tells the assembler to
     generate SVR4-style position-independent macro expansions.  It
     also tells the assembler to mark the output file as PIC.

`-mvxworks-pic'
     Generate VxWorks PIC.  This option tells the assembler to generate
     VxWorks-style position-independent macro expansions.

`-mips1'
`-mips2'
`-mips3'
`-mips4'
`-mips5'
`-mips32'
`-mips32r2'
`-mips32r3'
`-mips32r5'
`-mips64'
`-mips64r2'
`-mips64r3'
`-mips64r5'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  `-mips1' corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     `-mips2' to the R6000 processor, `-mips3' to the R4000 processor,
     and `-mips4' to the R8000 and R10000 processors.  `-mips5',
     `-mips32', `-mips32r2', `-mips32r3', `-mips32r5', `-mips64',
     `-mips64r2', `-mips64r3', and `-mips64r5' correspond to generic
     MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 Release 2, MIPS32 Release 3, MIPS32 Release
     5, MIPS64, and MIPS64 Release 2, MIPS64 Release 3, and MIPS64
     Release 5 ISA processors, respectively.  You can also switch
     instruction sets during the assembly; see *note Directives to
     override the ISA level: MIPS ISA.

`-mgp32'
`-mfp32'
     Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit
     registers.  The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA
     and ABI, but these flags force a certain group of registers to be
     treated as 32 bits wide at all times.  `-mgp32' controls the size
     of general-purpose registers and `-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

     The `.set gp=32' and `.set fp=32' directives allow the size of
     registers to be changed for parts of an object. The default value
     is restored by `.set gp=default' and `.set fp=default'.

     On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag
     is set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit
     OSes only save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is
     essential never to use the 64-bit registers.

`-mgp64'
`-mfp64'
     Assume that 64-bit registers are available.  This is provided in
     the interests of symmetry with `-mgp32' and `-mfp32'.

     The `.set gp=64' and `.set fp=64' directives allow the size of
     registers to be changed for parts of an object. The default value
     is restored by `.set gp=default' and `.set fp=default'.

`-mips16'
`-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.set mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-no-mips16' turns off this option.

`-mmicromips'
`-mno-micromips'
     Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.set micromips' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-mno-micromips' turns off this option.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.set nomicromips' at the start of the assembly file.

`-msmartmips'
`-mno-smartmips'
     Enables the SmartMIPS extensions to the MIPS32 instruction set,
     which provides a number of new instructions which target smartcard
     and cryptographic applications.  This is equivalent to putting
     `.set smartmips' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-mno-smartmips' turns off this option.

`-mips3d'
`-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.
     `-no-mips3d' turns off this option.

`-mdmx'
`-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  `-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

`-mdsp'
`-mno-dsp'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.
     `-mno-dsp' turns off this option.

`-mdspr2'
`-mno-dspr2'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies -mdsp.  This tells the assembler to accept DSP
     Release 2 instructions.  `-mno-dspr2' turns off this option.

`-mmt'
`-mno-mt'
     Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  `-mno-mt' turns
     off this option.

`-mmcu'
`-mno-mcu'
     Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  `-mno-mcu' turns
     off this option.

`-mmsa'
`-mno-msa'
     Generate code for the MIPS SIMD Architecture Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MSA instructions.  `-mno-msa' turns
     off this option.

`-mxpa'
`-mno-xpa'
     Generate code for the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA)
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept XPA instructions.
     `-mno-xpa' turns off this option.

`-mvirt'
`-mno-virt'
     Generate code for the Virtualization Application Specific
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept Virtualization
     instructions.  `-mno-virt' turns off this option.

`-minsn32'
`-mno-insn32'
     Only use 32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the
     microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits the use of any 16-bit
     instructions.  This is equivalent to putting `.set insn32' at the
     start of the assembly file.  `-mno-insn32' turns off this option.
     This is equivalent to putting `.set noinsn32' at the start of the
     assembly file.  By default `-mno-insn32' is selected, allowing all
     instructions to be used.

`-mfix7000'
`-mno-fix7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register
     of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two
     instructions.

`-mfix-rm7000'
`-mno-fix-rm7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if a dmult or dmultu instruction is
     followed by a load instruction.

`-mfix-loongson2f-jump'
`-mno-fix-loongson2f-jump'
     Eliminate instruction fetch from outside 256M region to work
     around the Loongson2F `jump' instructions.  Without it, under
     extreme cases, the kernel may crash.  The issue has been solved in
     latest processor batches, but this fix has no side effect to them.

`-mfix-loongson2f-nop'
`-mno-fix-loongson2f-nop'
     Replace nops by `or at,at,zero' to work around the Loongson2F
     `nop' errata.  Without it, under extreme cases, the CPU might
     deadlock.  The issue has been solved in later Loongson2F batches,
     but this fix has no side effect to them.

`-mfix-vr4120'
`-mno-fix-vr4120'
     Insert nops to work around certain VR4120 errata.  This option is
     intended to be used on GCC-generated code: it is not designed to
     catch all problems in hand-written assembler code.

`-mfix-vr4130'
`-mno-fix-vr4130'
     Insert nops to work around the VR4130 `mflo'/`mfhi' errata.

`-mfix-24k'
`-mno-fix-24k'
     Insert nops to work around the 24K `eret'/`deret' errata.

`-mfix-cn63xxp1'
`-mno-fix-cn63xxp1'
     Replace `pref' hints 0 - 4 and 6 - 24 with hint 28 to work around
     certain CN63XXP1 errata.

`-m4010'
`-no-m4010'
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010-specific instructions (`addciu', `ffc', etc.),
     and to not schedule `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI'
     and `LO' registers.  `-no-m4010' turns off this option.

`-m4650'
`-no-m4650'
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the `mad' and `madu' instruction, and to not schedule
     `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI' and `LO' registers.
     `-no-m4650' turns off this option.

`-m3900'
`-no-m3900'
`-m4100'
`-no-m4100'
     For each option `-mNNNN', generate code for the MIPS RNNNN chip.
     This tells the assembler to accept instructions specific to that
     chip, and to schedule for that chip's hazards.

`-march=CPU'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS CPU.  It is exactly equivalent
     to `-mCPU', except that there are more value of CPU understood.
     Valid CPU value are:

          2000, 3000, 3900, 4000, 4010, 4100, 4111, vr4120, vr4130,
          vr4181, 4300, 4400, 4600, 4650, 5000, rm5200, rm5230, rm5231,
          rm5261, rm5721, vr5400, vr5500, 6000, rm7000, 8000, rm9000,
          10000, 12000, 14000, 16000, 4kc, 4km, 4kp, 4ksc, 4kec, 4kem,
          4kep, 4ksd, m4k, m4kp, m14k, m14kc, m14ke, m14kec, 24kc,
          24kf2_1, 24kf, 24kf1_1, 24kec, 24kef2_1, 24kef, 24kef1_1,
          34kc, 34kf2_1, 34kf, 34kf1_1, 34kn, 74kc, 74kf2_1, 74kf,
          74kf1_1, 74kf3_2, 1004kc, 1004kf2_1, 1004kf, 1004kf1_1, p5600,
          5kc, 5kf, 20kc, 25kf, sb1, sb1a, loongson2e, loongson2f,
          loongson3a, octeon, octeon+, octeon2, xlr, xlp

     For compatibility reasons, `Nx' and `Bfx' are accepted as synonyms
     for `Nf1_1'.  These values are deprecated.

`-mtune=CPU'
     Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS CPU.  Valid CPU values are
     identical to `-march=CPU'.

`-mabi=ABI'
     Record which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: `32', `n32', `o64', `64' and `eabi'.

`-msym32'
`-mno-sym32'
     Equivalent to adding `.set sym32' or `.set nosym32' to the
     beginning of the assembler input.  *Note MIPS Symbol Sizes::.

`-nocpp'
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU `as', there is no need for
     `-nocpp', because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C
     preprocessor.

`-msoft-float'
`-mhard-float'
     Disable or enable floating-point instructions.  Note that by
     default floating-point instructions are always allowed even with
     CPU targets that don't have support for these instructions.

`-msingle-float'
`-mdouble-float'
     Disable or enable double-precision floating-point operations.  Note
     that by default double-precision floating-point operations are
     always allowed even with CPU targets that don't have support for
     these operations.

`--construct-floats'
`--no-construct-floats'
     The `--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  This feature is useful if the
     processor support the FR bit in its status  register, and this bit
     is known (by the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the
     aliasing of the double width register by the single width
     registers.

     By default `--construct-floats' is selected, allowing construction
     of these floating point constants.

`--relax-branch'
`--no-relax-branch'
     The `--relax-branch' option enables the relaxation of out-of-range
     branches.  Any branches whose target cannot be reached directly are
     converted to a small instruction sequence including an
     inverse-condition branch to the physically next instruction, and a
     jump to the original target is inserted between the two
     instructions.  In PIC code the jump will involve further
     instructions for address calculation.

     The `BC1ANY2F', `BC1ANY2T', `BC1ANY4F', `BC1ANY4T', `BPOSGE32' and
     `BPOSGE64' instructions are excluded from relaxation, because they
     have no complementing counterparts.  They could be relaxed with
     the use of a longer sequence involving another branch, however
     this has not been implemented and if their target turns out of
     reach, they produce an error even if branch relaxation is enabled.

     Also no MIPS16 branches are ever relaxed.

     By default `--no-relax-branch' is selected, causing any
     out-of-range branches to produce an error.

`-mnan=ENCODING'
     This option indicates whether the source code uses the IEEE 2008
     NaN encoding (`-mnan=2008') or the original MIPS encoding
     (`-mnan=legacy').  It is equivalent to adding a `.nan' directive
     to the beginning of the source file.  *Note MIPS NaN Encodings::.

     `-mnan=legacy' is the default if no `-mnan' option or `.nan'
     directive is used.

`--trap'
`--no-break'
     `as' automatically macro expands certain division and
     multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by
     zero.  This option causes `as' to generate code to take a trap
     exception rather than a break exception when an error is detected.
     The trap instructions are only supported at Instruction Set
     Architecture level 2 and higher.

`--break'
`--no-trap'
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.

`-mpdr'
`-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of `.pdr' sections.  Off by default on IRIX, on
     elsewhere.

`-mshared'
`-mno-shared'
     When generating code using the Unix calling conventions (selected
     by `-KPIC' or `-mcall_shared'), gas will normally generate code
     which can go into a shared library.  The `-mno-shared' option
     tells gas to generate code which uses the calling convention, but
     can not go into a shared library.  The resulting code is slightly
     more efficient.  This option only affects the handling of the
     `.cpload' and `.cpsetup' pseudo-ops.

9.27.2 High-level assembly macros
---------------------------------

MIPS assemblers have traditionally provided a wider range of
instructions than the MIPS architecture itself.  These extra
instructions are usually referred to as "macro" instructions (1).

   Some MIPS macro instructions extend an underlying architectural
instruction while others are entirely new.  An example of the former
type is `and', which allows the third operand to be either a register
or an arbitrary immediate value.  Examples of the latter type include
`bgt', which branches to the third operand when the first operand is
greater than the second operand, and `ulh', which implements an
unaligned 2-byte load.

   One of the most common extensions provided by macros is to expand
memory offsets to the full address range (32 or 64 bits) and to allow
symbolic offsets such as `my_data + 4' to be used in place of integer
constants.  For example, the architectural instruction `lbu' allows
only a signed 16-bit offset, whereas the macro `lbu' allows code such
as `lbu $4,array+32769($5)'.  The implementation of these symbolic
offsets depends on several factors, such as whether the assembler is
generating SVR4-style PIC (selected by `-KPIC', *note Assembler
options: MIPS Options.), the size of symbols (*note Directives to
override the size of symbols: MIPS Symbol Sizes.), and the small data
limit (*note Controlling the use of small data accesses: MIPS Small
Data.).

   Sometimes it is undesirable to have one assembly instruction expand
to several machine instructions.  The directive `.set nomacro' tells
the assembler to warn when this happens.  `.set macro' restores the
default behavior.

   Some macro instructions need a temporary register to store
intermediate results.  This register is usually `$1', also known as
`$at', but it can be changed to any core register REG using `.set
at=REG'.  Note that `$at' always refers to `$1' regardless of which
register is being used as the temporary register.

   Implicit uses of the temporary register in macros could interfere
with explicit uses in the assembly code.  The assembler therefore warns
whenever it sees an explicit use of the temporary register.  The
directive `.set noat' silences this warning while `.set at' restores
the default behavior.  It is safe to use `.set noat' while `.set
nomacro' is in effect since single-instruction macros never need a
temporary register.

   Note that while the GNU assembler provides these macros for
compatibility, it does not make any attempt to optimize them with the
surrounding code.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The term "macro" is somewhat overloaded here, since these macros
have no relation to those defined by `.macro', *note `.macro': Macro.

9.27.3 Directives to override the size of symbols
-------------------------------------------------

The n64 ABI allows symbols to have any 64-bit value.  Although this
provides a great deal of flexibility, it means that some macros have
much longer expansions than their 32-bit counterparts.  For example,
the non-PIC expansion of `dla $4,sym' is usually:

     lui     $4,%highest(sym)
     lui     $1,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%higher(sym)
     daddiu  $1,$1,%lo(sym)
     dsll32  $4,$4,0
     daddu   $4,$4,$1

   whereas the 32-bit expansion is simply:

     lui     $4,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(sym)

   n64 code is sometimes constructed in such a way that all symbolic
constants are known to have 32-bit values, and in such cases, it's
preferable to use the 32-bit expansion instead of the 64-bit expansion.

   You can use the `.set sym32' directive to tell the assembler that,
from this point on, all expressions of the form `SYMBOL' or `SYMBOL +
OFFSET' have 32-bit values.  For example:

     .set sym32
     dla     $4,sym
     lw      $4,sym+16
     sw      $4,sym+0x8000($4)

   will cause the assembler to treat `sym', `sym+16' and `sym+0x8000'
as 32-bit values.  The handling of non-symbolic addresses is not
affected.

   The directive `.set nosym32' ends a `.set sym32' block and reverts
to the normal behavior.  It is also possible to change the symbol size
using the command-line options `-msym32' and `-mno-sym32'.

   These options and directives are always accepted, but at present,
they have no effect for anything other than n64.

9.27.4 Controlling the use of small data accesses
-------------------------------------------------

It often takes several instructions to load the address of a symbol.
For example, when `addr' is a 32-bit symbol, the non-PIC expansion of
`dla $4,addr' is usually:

     lui     $4,%hi(addr)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(addr)

   The sequence is much longer when `addr' is a 64-bit symbol.  *Note
Directives to override the size of symbols: MIPS Symbol Sizes.

   In order to cut down on this overhead, most embedded MIPS systems
set aside a 64-kilobyte "small data" area and guarantee that all data
of size N and smaller will be placed in that area.  The limit N is
passed to both the assembler and the linker using the command-line
option `-G N', *note Assembler options: MIPS Options.  Note that the
same value of N must be used when linking and when assembling all input
files to the link; any inconsistency could cause a relocation overflow
error.

   The size of an object in the `.bss' section is set by the `.comm' or
`.lcomm' directive that defines it.  The size of an external object may
be set with the `.extern' directive.  For example, `.extern sym,4'
declares that the object at `sym' is 4 bytes in length, while leaving
`sym' otherwise undefined.

   When no `-G' option is given, the default limit is 8 bytes.  The
option `-G 0' prevents any data from being automatically classified as
small.

   It is also possible to mark specific objects as small by putting them
in the special sections `.sdata' and `.sbss', which are "small"
counterparts of `.data' and `.bss' respectively.  The toolchain will
treat such data as small regardless of the `-G' setting.

   On startup, systems that support a small data area are expected to
initialize register `$28', also known as `$gp', in such a way that
small data can be accessed using a 16-bit offset from that register.
For example, when `addr' is small data, the `dla $4,addr' instruction
above is equivalent to:

     daddiu  $4,$28,%gp_rel(addr)

   Small data is not supported for SVR4-style PIC.

9.27.5 Directives to override the ISA level
-------------------------------------------

GNU `as' supports an additional directive to change the MIPS
Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: `.set mipsN'.  N should
be a number from 0 to 5, or 32, 32r2, 32r3, 32r5, 64, 64r2, 64r3 or
64r5.  The values other than 0 make the assembler accept instructions
for the corresponding ISA level, from that point on in the assembly.
`.set mipsN' affects not only which instructions are permitted, but
also how certain macros are expanded.  `.set mips0' restores the ISA
level to its original level: either the level you selected with command
line options, or the default for your configuration.  You can use this
feature to permit specific MIPS III instructions while assembling in 32
bit mode.  Use this directive with care!

   The `.set arch=CPU' directive provides even finer control.  It
changes the effective CPU target and allows the assembler to use
instructions specific to a particular CPU.  All CPUs supported by the
`-march' command line option are also selectable by this directive.
The original value is restored by `.set arch=default'.

   The directive `.set mips16' puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode, in
which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
`.set nomips16' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

   The directive `.set micromips' puts the assembler into microMIPS
mode, in which it will assemble instructions for the microMIPS
processor.  Use `.set nomicromips' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

9.27.6 Directives to control code generation
--------------------------------------------

The `.module' directive allows command line options to be set directly
from assembly.  The format of the directive matches the `.set'
directive but only those options which are relevant to a whole module
are supported.  The effect of a `.module' directive is the same as the
corresponding command line option.  Where `.set' directives support
returning to a default then the `.module' directives do not as they
define the defaults.

   These module-level directives must appear first in assembly.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

   The directive `.set insn32' makes the assembler only use 32-bit
instruction encodings when generating code for the microMIPS processor.
This directive inhibits the use of any 16-bit instructions from that
point on in the assembly.  The `.set noinsn32' directive allows 16-bit
instructions to be accepted.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS autoextend,  Next: MIPS insn,  Prev: MIPS assembly options,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

9.27.7 Directives for extending MIPS 16 bit instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, MIPS 16 instructions are automatically extended to 32 bits
when necessary.  The directive `.set noautoextend' will turn this off.
When `.set noautoextend' is in effect, any 32 bit instruction must be
explicitly extended with the `.e' modifier (e.g., `li.e $4,1000').  The
directive `.set autoextend' may be used to once again automatically
extend instructions when necessary.

   This directive is only meaningful when in MIPS 16 mode.  Traditional
MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS insn,  Next: MIPS NaN Encodings,  Prev: MIPS autoextend,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

9.27.8 Directive to mark data as an instruction
-----------------------------------------------

The `.insn' directive tells `as' that the following data is actually
instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 and microMIPS modes:
when loading the address of a label which precedes instructions, `as'
automatically adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to the loaded
address will do the right thing.

   The `.global' and `.globl' directives supported by `as' will by
default mark the symbol as pointing to a region of data not code.  This
means that, for example, any instructions following such a symbol will
not be disassembled by `objdump' as it will regard them as data.  To
change this behaviour an optional section name can be placed after the
symbol name in the `.global' directive.  If this section exists and is
known to be a code section, then the symbol will be marked as poiting at
code not data.  Ie the syntax for the directive is:

   `.global SYMBOL[ SECTION][, SYMBOL[ SECTION]] ...',

   Here is a short example:

             .global foo .text, bar, baz .data
     foo:
             nop
     bar:
             .word 0x0
     baz:
             .word 0x1

9.27.9 Directives to record which NaN encoding is being used
------------------------------------------------------------

The IEEE 754 floating-point standard defines two types of not-a-number
(NaN) data: "signalling" NaNs and "quiet" NaNs.  The original version
of the standard did not specify how these two types should be
distinguished.  Most implementations followed the i387 model, in which
the first bit of the significand is set for quiet NaNs and clear for
signalling NaNs.  However, the original MIPS implementation assigned the
opposite meaning to the bit, so that it was set for signalling NaNs and
clear for quiet NaNs.

   The 2008 revision of the standard formally suggested the i387 choice
and as from Sep 2012 the current release of the MIPS architecture
therefore optionally supports that form.  Code that uses one NaN
encoding would usually be incompatible with code that uses the other
NaN encoding, so MIPS ELF objects have a flag (`EF_MIPS_NAN2008') to
record which encoding is being used.

   Assembly files can use the `.nan' directive to select between the
two encodings.  `.nan 2008' says that the assembly file uses the IEEE
754-2008 encoding while `.nan legacy' says that the file uses the
original MIPS encoding.  If several `.nan' directives are given, the
final setting is the one that is used.

   The command-line options `-mnan=legacy' and `-mnan=2008' can be used
instead of `.nan legacy' and `.nan 2008' respectively.  However, any
`.nan' directive overrides the command-line setting.

   `.nan legacy' is the default if no `.nan' directive or `-mnan'
option is given.

   Note that GNU `as' does not produce NaNs itself and therefore these
directives do not affect code generation.  They simply control the
setting of the `EF_MIPS_NAN2008' flag.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

9.27.10 Directives to save and restore options
----------------------------------------------

The directives `.set push' and `.set pop' may be used to save and
restore the current settings for all the options which are controlled
by `.set'.  The `.set push' directive saves the current settings on a
stack.  The `.set pop' directive pops the stack and restores the
settings.

   These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

nodspr2' directive prevents DSP Release 2 instructions from being
accepted.

   The directive `.set mt' makes the assembler accept instructions from
the MT Application Specific Extension from that point on in the
assembly.  The `.set nomt' directive prevents MT instructions from

The presence of a `#' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.28.1 Command-line Options
---------------------------

The MMIX version of `as' has some machine-dependent options.

   When `--fixed-special-register-names' is specified, only the register
names specified in *note MMIX-Regs:: are recognized in the instructions
`PUT' and `GET'.

   You can use the `--globalize-symbols' to make all symbols global.
This option is useful when splitting up a `mmixal' program into several
files.

   The `--gnu-syntax' turns off most syntax compatibility with
`mmixal'.  Its usability is currently doubtful.

   The `--relax' option is not fully supported, but will eventually make
the object file prepared for linker relaxation.

   If you want to avoid inadvertently calling a predefined symbol and
would rather get an error, for example when using `as' with a compiler
or other machine-generated code, specify `--no-predefined-syms'.  This
turns off built-in predefined definitions of all such symbols,
including rounding-mode symbols, segment symbols, `BIT' symbols, and
`TRAP' symbols used in `mmix' "system calls".  It also turns off
predefined special-register names, except when used in `PUT' and `GET'
instructions.

   By default, some instructions are expanded to fit the size of the
operand or an external symbol (*note MMIX-Expand::).  By passing
`--no-expand', no such expansion will be done, instead causing errors
at link time if the operand does not fit.

   The `mmixal' documentation (*note mmixsite::) specifies that global
registers allocated with the `GREG' directive (*note MMIX-greg::) and
initialized to the same non-zero value, will refer to the same global
register.  This isn't strictly enforceable in `as' since the final
addresses aren't known until link-time, but it will do an effort unless
the `--no-merge-gregs' option is specified.  (Register merging isn't
yet implemented in `ld'.)

   `as' will warn every time it expands an instruction to fit an
operand unless the option `-x' is specified.  It is believed that this
behaviour is more useful than just mimicking `mmixal''s behaviour, in
which instructions are only expanded if the `-x' option is specified,
and assembly fails otherwise, when an instruction needs to be expanded.
It needs to be kept in mind that `mmixal' is both an assembler and
linker, while `as' will expand instructions that at link stage can be
contracted.  (Though linker relaxation isn't yet implemented in `ld'.)
The option `-x' also imples `--linker-allocated-gregs'.

   If instruction expansion is enabled, `as' can expand a `PUSHJ'
instruction into a series of instructions.  The shortest expansion is
to not expand it, but just mark the call as redirectable to a stub,
which `ld' creates at link-time, but only if the original `PUSHJ'
instruction is found not to reach the target.  The stub consists of the
necessary instructions to form a jump to the target.  This happens if
`as' can assert that the `PUSHJ' instruction can reach such a stub.
The option `--no-pushj-stubs' disables this shorter expansion, and the
longer series of instructions is then created at assembly-time.  The
option `--no-stubs' is a synonym, intended for compatibility with
future releases, where generation of stubs for other instructions may
be implemented.

   Usually a two-operand-expression (*note GREG-base::) without a
matching `GREG' directive is treated as an error by `as'.  When the
option `--linker-allocated-gregs' is in effect, they are instead passed
through to the linker, which will allocate as many global registers as
is needed.

9.28.2 Instruction expansion
----------------------------

When `as' encounters an instruction with an operand that is either not
known or does not fit the operand size of the instruction, `as' (and
`ld') will expand the instruction into a sequence of instructions
semantically equivalent to the operand fitting the instruction.
Expansion will take place for the following instructions:

`GETA'
     Expands to a sequence of four instructions: `SETL', `INCML',
     `INCMH' and `INCH'.  The operand must be a multiple of four.

Conditional branches
     A branch instruction is turned into a branch with the complemented
     condition and prediction bit over five instructions; four
     instructions setting `$255' to the operand value, which like with
     `GETA' must be a multiple of four, and a final `GO $255,$255,0'.

`PUSHJ'
     Similar to expansion for conditional branches; four instructions
     set `$255' to the operand value, followed by a `PUSHGO
     $255,$255,0'.

`JMP'
     Similar to conditional branches and `PUSHJ'.  The final instruction
     is `GO $255,$255,0'.

   The linker `ld' is expected to shrink these expansions for code
assembled with `--relax' (though not currently implemented).

9.28.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembly syntax is supposed to be upward compatible with that
described in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of `The Art of Computer Programming,
Volume 1'.  Draft versions of those chapters as well as other MMIX
information is located at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html'.  Most code
examples from the mmixal package located there should work unmodified
when assembled and linked as single files, with a few noteworthy
exceptions (*note MMIX-mmixal::).

   Before an instruction is emitted, the current location is aligned to
the next four-byte boundary.  If a label is defined at the beginning of
the line, its value will be the aligned value.

   In addition to the traditional hex-prefix `0x', a hexadecimal number
can also be specified by the prefix character `#'.

   After all operands to an MMIX instruction or directive have been
specified, the rest of the line is ignored, treated as a comment.

9.28.3.1 Special Characters
...........................

The characters `*' and `#' are line comment characters; each start a
comment at the beginning of a line, but only at the beginning of a
line.  A `#' prefixes a hexadecimal number if found elsewhere on a
line.  If a `#' appears at the start of a line the whole line is
treated as a comment, but the line can also act as a logical line
number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command
(*note Preprocessing::).

   Two other characters, `%' and `!', each start a comment anywhere on
the line.  Thus you can't use the `modulus' and `not' operators in
expressions normally associated with these two characters.

   A `;' is a line separator, treated as a new-line, so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.


File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Symbols,  Next: MMIX-Regs,  Prev: MMIX-Chars,  Up: MMIX-Syntax

9.28.3.2 Symbols
................

The character `:' is permitted in identifiers.  There are two
exceptions to it being treated as any other symbol character: if a
symbol begins with `:', it means that the symbol is in the global
namespace and that the current prefix should not be prepended to that
symbol (*note MMIX-prefix::).  The `:' is then not considered part of
the symbol.  For a symbol in the label position (first on a line), a `:'
at the end of a symbol is silently stripped off.  A label is permitted,
but not required, to be followed by a `:', as with many other assembly
formats.

   The character `@' in an expression, is a synonym for `.', the
current location.

   In addition to the common forward and backward local symbol formats
(*note Symbol Names::), they can be specified with upper-case `B' and
`F', as in `8B' and `9F'.  A local label defined for the current
position is written with a `H' appended to the number:
     3H LDB $0,$1,2
   This and traditional local-label formats cannot be mixed: a label
must be defined and referred to using the same format.

   There's a minor caveat: just as for the ordinary local symbols, the
local symbols are translated into ordinary symbols using control
characters are to hide the ordinal number of the symbol.
Unfortunately, these symbols are not translated back in error messages.
Thus you may see confusing error messages when local symbols are used.
Control characters `\003' (control-C) and `\004' (control-D) are used
for the MMIX-specific local-symbol syntax.

   The symbol `Main' is handled specially; it is always global.

   By defining the symbols `__.MMIX.start..text' and
`__.MMIX.start..data', the address of respectively the `.text' and
`.data' segments of the final program can be defined, though when
linking more than one object file, the code or data in the object file
containing the symbol is not guaranteed to be start at that position;
just the final executable.  *Note MMIX-loc::.

9.28.3.3 Register names
.......................

Local and global registers are specified as `$0' to `$255'.  The
recognized special register names are `rJ', `rA', `rB', `rC', `rD',
`rE', `rF', `rG', `rH', `rI', `rK', `rL', `rM', `rN', `rO', `rP', `rQ',
`rR', `rS', `rT', `rU', `rV', `rW', `rX', `rY', `rZ', `rBB', `rTT',
`rWW', `rXX', `rYY' and `rZZ'.  A leading `:' is optional for special
register names.

   Local and global symbols can be equated to register names and used in
place of ordinary registers.

   Similarly for special registers, local and global symbols can be
used.  Also, symbols equated from numbers and constant expressions are
allowed in place of a special register, except when either of the
options `--no-predefined-syms' and `--fixed-special-register-names' are
specified.  Then only the special register names above are allowed for
the instructions having a special register operand; `GET' and `PUT'.


File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Pseudos,  Prev: MMIX-Regs,  Up: MMIX-Syntax

9.28.3.4 Assembler Directives
.............................

`LOC'
     The `LOC' directive sets the current location to the value of the
     operand field, which may include changing sections.  If the
     operand is a constant, the section is set to either `.data' if the
     value is `0x2000000000000000' or larger, else it is set to `.text'.
     Within a section, the current location may only be changed to
     monotonically higher addresses.  A LOC expression must be a
     previously defined symbol or a "pure" constant.

     An example, which sets the label PREV to the current location, and
     updates the current location to eight bytes forward:
          prev LOC @+8

     When a LOC has a constant as its operand, a symbol
     `__.MMIX.start..text' or `__.MMIX.start..data' is defined
     depending on the address as mentioned above.  Each such symbol is
     interpreted as special by the linker, locating the section at that
     address.  Note that if multiple files are linked, the first object
     file with that section will be mapped to that address (not
     necessarily the file with the LOC definition).

`LOCAL'
     Example:
           LOCAL external_symbol
           LOCAL 42
           .local asymbol

     This directive-operation generates a link-time assertion that the
     operand does not correspond to a global register.  The operand is
     an expression that at link-time resolves to a register symbol or a
     number.  A number is treated as the register having that number.
     There is one restriction on the use of this directive: the
     pseudo-directive must be placed in a section with contents, code
     or data.

`IS'
     The `IS' directive:
          asymbol IS an_expression
     sets the symbol `asymbol' to `an_expression'.  A symbol may not be
     set more than once using this directive.  Local labels may be set
     using this directive, for example:
          5H IS @+4

`GREG'
     This directive reserves a global register, gives it an initial
     value and optionally gives it a symbolic name.  Some examples:

          areg GREG
          breg GREG data_value
               GREG data_buffer
               .greg creg, another_data_value

     The symbolic register name can be used in place of a (non-special)
     register.  If a value isn't provided, it defaults to zero.  Unless
     the option `--no-merge-gregs' is specified, non-zero registers
     allocated with this directive may be eliminated by `as'; another
     register with the same value used in its place.  Any of the
     instructions `CSWAP', `GO', `LDA', `LDBU', `LDB', `LDHT', `LDOU',
     `LDO', `LDSF', `LDTU', `LDT', `LDUNC', `LDVTS', `LDWU', `LDW',
     `PREGO', `PRELD', `PREST', `PUSHGO', `STBU', `STB', `STCO', `STHT',
     `STOU', `STSF', `STTU', `STT', `STUNC', `SYNCD', `SYNCID', can
     have a value nearby an initial value in place of its second and
     third operands.  Here, "nearby" is defined as within the range
     0...255 from the initial value of such an allocated register.

          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
           GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,buffer2
     In the example above, the `Y' field of the `LDOUI' instruction
     (LDOU with a constant Z) will be replaced with the global register
     allocated for `buffer1', and the `Z' field will have the value 5,
     the offset from `buffer1' to `buffer2'.  The result is equivalent
     to this code:
          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
          tmpreg GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,tmpreg,(buffer2-buffer1)

     Global registers allocated with this directive are allocated in
     order higher-to-lower within a file.  Other than that, the exact
     order of register allocation and elimination is undefined.  For
     example, the order is undefined when more than one file with such
     directives are linked together.  With the options `-x' and
     `--linker-allocated-gregs', `GREG' directives for two-operand
     cases like the one mentioned above can be omitted.  Sufficient
     global registers will then be allocated by the linker.

`BYTE'
     The `BYTE' directive takes a series of operands separated by a
     comma.  If an operand is a string (*note Strings::), each
     character of that string is emitted as a byte.  Other operands
     must be constant expressions without forward references, in the
     range 0...255.  If you need operands having expressions with
     forward references, use `.byte' (*note Byte::).  An operand can be
     omitted, defaulting to a zero value.

`WYDE'
`TETRA'
`OCTA'
     The directives `WYDE', `TETRA' and `OCTA' emit constants of two,
     four and eight bytes size respectively.  Before anything else
     happens for the directive, the current location is aligned to the
     respective constant-size boundary.  If a label is defined at the
     beginning of the line, its value will be that after the alignment.
     A single operand can be omitted, defaulting to a zero value
     emitted for the directive.  Operands can be expressed as strings
     (*note Strings::), in which case each character in the string is
     emitted as a separate constant of the size indicated by the
     directive.

`PREFIX'
     The `PREFIX' directive sets a symbol name prefix to be prepended to
     all symbols (except local symbols, *note MMIX-Symbols::), that are
     not prefixed with `:', until the next `PREFIX' directive.  Such
     prefixes accumulate.  For example,
           PREFIX a
           PREFIX b
          c IS 0
     defines a symbol `abc' with the value 0.

`BSPEC'
`ESPEC'
     A pair of `BSPEC' and `ESPEC' directives delimit a section of
     special contents (without specified semantics).  Example:
           BSPEC 42
           TETRA 1,2,3
           ESPEC
     The single operand to `BSPEC' must be number in the range 0...255.
     The `BSPEC' number 80 is used by the GNU binutils implementation.

9.28.4 Differences to `mmixal'
------------------------------

The binutils `as' and `ld' combination has a few differences in
function compared to `mmixal' (*note mmixsite::).

   The replacement of a symbol with a GREG-allocated register (*note
GREG-base::) is not handled the exactly same way in `as' as in
`mmixal'.  This is apparent in the `mmixal' example file `inout.mms',
where different registers with different offsets, eventually yielding
the same address, are used in the first instruction.  This type of
difference should however not affect the function of any program unless
it has specific assumptions about the allocated register number.

   Line numbers (in the `mmo' object format) are currently not
supported.

   Expression operator precedence is not that of mmixal: operator
precedence is that of the C programming language.  It's recommended to
use parentheses to explicitly specify wanted operator precedence
whenever more than one type of operators are used.

   The serialize unary operator `&', the fractional division operator
`//', the logical not operator `!' and the modulus operator `%' are not
available.

   Symbols are not global by default, unless the option
`--globalize-symbols' is passed.  Use the `.global' directive to
globalize symbols (*note Global::).

   Operand syntax is a bit stricter with `as' than `mmixal'.  For
example, you can't say `addu 1,2,3', instead you must write `addu
$1,$2,3'.

   You can't LOC to a lower address than those already visited (i.e.,
"backwards").

   A LOC directive must come before any emitted code.

   Predefined symbols are visible as file-local symbols after use.  (In
the ELF file, that is--the linked mmo file has no notion of a file-local
symbol.)

   Some mapping of constant expressions to sections in LOC expressions
is attempted, but that functionality is easily confused and should be
avoided unless compatibility with `mmixal' is required.  A LOC
expression to `0x2000000000000000' or higher, maps to the `.data'
section and lower addresses map to the `.text' section (*note
MMIX-loc::).

   The code and data areas are each contiguous.  Sparse programs with
far-away LOC directives will take up the same amount of space as a
contiguous program with zeros filled in the gaps between the LOC
directives.  If you need sparse programs, you might try and get the
wanted effect with a linker script and splitting up the code parts into
sections (*note Section::).  Assembly code for this, to be compatible
with `mmixal', would look something like:
      .if 0
      LOC away_expression
      .else
      .section away,"ax"
      .fi
   `as' will not execute the LOC directive and `mmixal' ignores the
lines with `.'.  This construct can be used generally to help
compatibility.

   Symbols can't be defined twice-not even to the same value.

   Instruction mnemonics are recognized case-insensitive, though the
`IS' and `GREG' pseudo-operations must be specified in upper-case
characters.

   There's no unicode support.

   The following is a list of programs in `mmix.tar.gz', available at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html', last
checked with the version dated 2001-08-25 (md5sum
c393470cfc86fac040487d22d2bf0172) that assemble with `mmixal' but do
not assemble with `as':

`silly.mms'
     LOC to a previous address.

`sim.mms'
     Redefines symbol `Done'.

`test.mms'
     Uses the serial operator `&'.

`-mmcu'
     selects the mcu architecture.  If the architecture is 430Xv2 then
     this also enables NOP generation unless the `-mN' is also
     specified.

`-mcpu'
     selects the cpu architecture.  If the architecture is 430Xv2 then

`-mP'

`-mQ'
     enables relaxation at assembly time. DANGEROUS!

`-ml'
     indicates that the input uses the large code model.

`-mn'
     enables the generation of a NOP instruction following any
     instruction that might change the interrupts enabled/disabled
     state.  The pipelined nature of the MSP430 core means that any
     instruction that changes the interrupt state (`EINT', `DINT', `BIC
     #8, SR', `BIS #8, SR' or `MOV.W <>, SR') must be followed by a NOP
     instruction in order to ensure the correct processing of
     interrupts.  By default it is up to the programmer to supply these
     NOP instructions, but this command line option enables the
     automatic insertion by the assembler, if they are missing.

`-mN'
     disables the generation of a NOP instruction following any
     instruction that might change the interrupts enabled/disabled
     state.  This is the default behaviour.

`-my'
     tells the assembler to generate a warning message if a NOP does not
     immediately forllow an instruction that enables or disables
     interrupts.  This is the default.

     Note that this option can be stacked with the `-mn' option so that
     the assembler will both warn about missing NOP instructions and
     then insert them automatically.

`-mY'
     disables warnings about missing NOP instructions.

`-md'
     mark the object file as one that requires data to copied from ROM
     to RAM at execution startup.  Disabled by default.

form `rN' (for global registers), where N represents a number between
`0' and `15'.  The leading letters may be in either upper or lower
case; for example, `r13' and `R7' are both valid register names.

   Register names `PC', `SP' and `SR' cannot be used as register names
and will be treated as variables. Use `r0', `r1', and `r2' instead.

9.29.2.4 Assembler Extensions
.............................

`@rN'
     As destination operand being treated as `0(rn)'

`0(rN)'
     As source operand being treated as `@rn'

`jCOND +N'
     Skips next N bytes followed by jump instruction and equivalent to
     `jCOND $+N+2'


   Also, there are some instructions, which cannot be found in other
assemblers.  These are branch instructions, which has different opcodes
upon jump distance.  They all got PC relative addressing mode.

`beq label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jeq label' in case if jump
     distance within allowed range for cpu's jump instruction. If not,
     this unrolls into a sequence of
            jne $+6
            br  label

`bne label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jne label' or `jeq +4; br label'

`blt label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jl label' or `jge +4; br label'

`bltn label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jn label' or `jn +2; jmp +4; br
     label'

`bltu label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jlo label' or `jhs +2; br label'

`bge label'

9.29.4 MSP 430 Machine Directives
---------------------------------

`.file'
     This directive is ignored; it is accepted for compatibility with
     other MSP 430 assemblers.

          _Warning:_ in other versions of the GNU assembler, `.file' is
          used for the directive called `.app-file' in the MSP 430
          support.

`.line'
     This directive is ignored; it is accepted for compatibility with
     other MSP 430 assemblers.

`.arch'
     Sets the target microcontroller in the same way as the `-mmcu'
     command line option.

`.cpu'
     Sets the target architecture in the same way as the `-mcpu'
     command line option.

`.profiler'
     This directive instructs assembler to add new profile entry to the
     object file.

`.refsym'
     This directive instructs assembler to add an undefined reference to
     the symbol following the directive.  The maximum symbol name
     length is 1023 characters.  No relocation is created for this
     symbol; it will exist purely for pulling in object files from
     archives.  Note that this reloc is not sufficient to prevent
     garbage collection; use a KEEP() directive in the linker file to
     preserve such objects.

9.29.6 Profiling Capability
---------------------------

It is a performance hit to use gcc's profiling approach for this tiny
target.  Even more - jtag hardware facility does not perform any
profiling functions.  However we've got gdb's built-in simulator where
we can do anything.

   We define new section `.profiler' which holds all profiling
information.  We define new pseudo operation `.profiler' which will
instruct assembler to add new profile entry to the object file. Profile
should take place at the present address.

   Pseudo operation format:

   `.profiler flags,function_to_profile [, cycle_corrector, extra]'

   where:

          `flags' is a combination of the following characters:

    `s'
          function entry

    `x'
          function exit

    `i'
          function is in init section

    `f'
          function is in fini section

    `l'
          library call

    `c'
          libc standard call

    `d'
          stack value demand

    `I'
          interrupt service routine

    `P'
          prologue start

    `p'
          prologue end

    `E'
          epilogue start

    `e'
          epilogue end

    `j'
          long jump / sjlj unwind

    `a'
          an arbitrary code fragment

    `t'
          extra parameter saved (a constant value like frame size)

`function_to_profile'
     a function address

`cycle_corrector'
     a value which should be added to the cycle counter, zero if
     omitted.

`extra'
     any extra parameter, zero if omitted.


   For example:
     .global fxx
     .type fxx,@function
     fxx:
     .LFrameOffset_fxx=0x08
     .profiler "scdP", fxx     ; function entry.
     			  ; we also demand stack value to be saved
       push r11
       push r10
       push r9
       push r8
     .profiler "cdpt",fxx,0, .LFrameOffset_fxx  ; check stack value at this point
     					  ; (this is a prologue end)
     					  ; note, that spare var filled with
     					  ; the farme size
       mov r15,r8
     ...
     .profiler cdE,fxx         ; check stack
       pop r8
       pop r9
       pop r10
       pop r11
     .profiler xcde,fxx,3      ; exit adds 3 to the cycle counter
       ret                     ; cause 'ret' insn takes 3 cycles

`-relax-section'
     Replace identified out-of-range branches with PC-relative `jmp'
     sequences when possible.  The generated code sequences are suitable
     for use in position-independent code, but there is a practical
     limit on the extended branch range because of the length of the
     sequences.  This option is the default.

`-relax-all'
     Replace branch instructions not determinable to be in range and
     all call instructions with `jmp' and `callr' sequences
     (respectively).  This option generates absolute relocations
     against the target symbols and is not appropriate for
     position-independent code.

`-no-relax'
     Do not replace any branches or calls.

`-EB'
     Generate big-endian output.

`%hiadj(EXPRESSION)'
     Extract the upper 16 bits of EXPRESSION and add one if the 15th

     The value of `%hiadj(EXPRESSION)' is:
          ((EXPRESSION >> 16) & 0xffff) + ((EXPRESSION >> 15) & 0x01)

     The `%hiadj' relocation is intended to be used with the `addi',
     `ld' or `st' instructions along with a `%lo', in order to load a
     32-bit constant.

          movhi r2, %hiadj(symbol)
          addi r2, r2, %lo(symbol)

`%hi(EXPRESSION)'
     Extract the upper 16 bits of EXPRESSION.

`%lo(EXPRESSION)'
     Extract the lower 16 bits of EXPRESSION.

`%gprel(EXPRESSION)'
     Subtract the value of the symbol `_gp' from EXPRESSION.

     The intention of the `%gprel' relocation is to have a fast small
     area of memory which only takes a 16-bit immediate to access.

          	.section .sdata
          fastint:

`.8byte EXPRESSION'
     Create an unaligned constant 8 bytes in size.

`.16byte EXPRESSION'
     Create an unaligned constant 16 bytes in size.

`.set noat'
     Allows assembly code to use `at' register without warning.  Macro
     or relaxation expansions generate warnings.

`.set at'
     Assembly code using `at' register generates warnings, and macro
     expansion and relaxation are enabled.

`.set nobreak'
     Allows assembly code to use `ba' and `bt' registers without
     warning.

`.set break'
     Turns warnings back on for using `ba' and `bt' registers.

`.set norelax'
     Do not replace any branches or calls.

`.set relaxsection'
     Replace identified out-of-range branches with `jmp' sequences
     (default).

`.set relaxsection'
     Replace all branch and call instructions with `jmp' and `callr'
     sequences.

`.set ...'

The presence of a `#' appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   If Sequent compatibility has been configured into the assembler then
the `|' character appearing as the first character on a line will also
indicate the start of a line comment.

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.33.2 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The PDP-11 version of `as' has a few machine dependent assembler
directives.

`.bss'
     Switch to the `bss' section.

`.even'
     Align the location counter to an even number.

9.33.3 PDP-11 Assembly Language Syntax
--------------------------------------

`as' supports both DEC syntax and BSD syntax.  The only difference is
that in DEC syntax, a `#' character is used to denote an immediate
constants, while in BSD syntax the character for this purpose is `$'.

   general-purpose registers are named `r0' through `r7'.  Mnemonic
alternatives for `r6' and `r7' are `sp' and `pc', respectively.

   Floating-point registers are named `ac0' through `ac3', or
alternatively `fr0' through `fr3'.

   Comments are started with a `#' or a `/' character, and extend to
the end of the line.  (FIXME: clash with immediates?)

   Multiple statements on the same line can be separated by the `;'
character.

A number of assembler directives are available for PowerPC.  The
following table is far from complete.

`.machine "string"'
     This directive allows you to change the machine for which code is
     generated.  `"string"' may be any of the -m cpu selection options

9.37.1 RX Options
-----------------

The Renesas RX port of `as' has a few target specfic command line
options:

`-m32bit-doubles'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions, but it does
     influence the behaviour of the `.double' pseudo-op.  This is the
     default.

`-m64bit-doubles'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions, but it does
     influence the behaviour of the `.double' pseudo-op.

`-mbig-endian'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a big-endian data
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions, but it does
     influence the behaviour of the `.short', `.hword', `.int',
     `.word', `.long', `.quad' and `.octa' pseudo-ops.

`-mlittle-endian'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a little-endian
     data ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions, but it
     does influence the behaviour of the `.short', `.hword', `.int',
     `.word', `.long', `.quad' and `.octa' pseudo-ops.  This is the
     default.

`-muse-conventional-section-names'
     This option controls the default names given to the code (.text),
     initialised data (.data) and uninitialised data sections (.bss).

`-muse-renesas-section-names'
     This option controls the default names given to the code (.P),
     initialised data (.D_1) and uninitialised data sections (.B_1).
     This is the default.

`-msmall-data-limit'
     This option tells the assembler that the small data limit feature
     of the RX port of GCC is being used.  This results in the assembler
     generating an undefined reference to a symbol called `__gp' for
     use by the relocations that are needed to support the small data
     limit feature.   This option is not enabled by default as it would
     otherwise pollute the symbol table.

`-mpid'
     This option tells the assembler that the position independent data
     of the RX port of GCC is being used.  This results in the assembler
     generating an undefined reference to a symbol called `__pid_base',
     and also setting the RX_PID flag bit in the e_flags field of the
     ELF header of the object file.

`-mint-register=NUM'
     This option tells the assembler how many registers have been
     reserved for use by interrupt handlers.  This is needed in order
     to compute the correct values for the `%gpreg' and `%pidreg' meta
     registers.

`-mgcc-abi'
     This option tells the assembler that the old GCC ABI is being used
     by the assembled code.  With this version of the ABI function
     arguments that are passed on the stack are aligned to a 32-bit
     boundary.

`-mrx-abi'
     This option tells the assembler that the official RX ABI is being
     used by the assembled code.  With this version of the ABI function
     arguments that are passed on the stack are aligned to their natural
     alignments.  This option is the default.

`-mcpu=NAME'
     This option tells the assembler the target CPU type.  Currently the
     `rx200', `rx600' and `rx610' are recognised as valid cpu names.
     Attempting to assemble an instruction not supported by the
     indicated cpu type will result in an error message being generated.



File: as.info,  Node: RX-Modifiers,  Next: RX-Directives,  Prev: RX-Opts,  Up: RX-Dependent

9.37.2 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports one modifier when using symbol addresses in RX
instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     %gp(symbol)

   The modifier returns the offset from the __GP symbol to the
specified symbol as a 16-bit value.  The intent is that this offset
should be used in a register+offset move instruction when generating
references to small data.  Ie, like this:

       mov.W	 %gp(_foo)[%gpreg], r1

   The assembler also supports two meta register names which can be used
to refer to registers whose values may not be known to the programmer.
These meta register names are:

`%gpreg'
     The small data address register.

`%pidreg'
     The PID base address register.


   Both registers normally have the value r13, but this can change if
some registers have been reserved for use by interrupt handlers or if
both the small data limit and position independent data features are
being used at the same time.

9.37.3 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The RX version of `as' has the following specific assembler directives:

`.3byte'
     Inserts a 3-byte value into the output file at the current
     location.

`.fetchalign'
     If the next opcode following this directive spans a fetch line
     boundary (8 byte boundary), the opcode is aligned to that boundary.
     If the next opcode does not span a fetch line, this directive has
     no effect.  Note that one or more labels may be between this
     directive and the opcode; those labels are aligned as well.  Any
     inserted bytes due to alignment will form a NOP opcode.

9.37.4 Floating Point
---------------------

The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision (32-bit) floating point constants.

`.double'
     If the `-m64bit-doubles' command line option has been specified
     then then `double' directive generates `double' precision (64-bit)
     floating point constants, otherwise it generates `single'
     precision (32-bit) floating point constants.  To force the
     generation of 64-bit floating point constants used the `dc.d'
     directive instead.

The presence of a `;' appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `!' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.38 IBM S/390 Dependent Features
=================================

   The s390 version of `as' supports two architectures modes and seven
chip levels. The architecture modes are the Enterprise System
Architecture (ESA) and the newer z/Architecture mode. The chip levels
are g5, g6, z900, z990, z9-109, z9-ec, z10, z196, and zEC12.

9.38.1 Options
--------------

The following table lists all available s390 specific options:

`-m31 | -m64'
     Select 31- or 64-bit ABI implying a word size of 32- or 64-bit.

     These options are only available with the ELF object file format,
     and require that the necessary BFD support has been included (on a
     31-bit platform you must add -enable-64-bit-bfd on the call to the
     configure script to enable 64-bit usage and use s390x as target
     platform).

`-mesa | -mzarch'
     Select the architecture mode, either the Enterprise System
     Architecture (esa) mode or the z/Architecture mode (zarch).

     The 64-bit instructions are only available with the z/Architecture
     mode.  The combination of `-m64' and `-mesa' results in a warning
     message.

`-march=CPU'
     This option specifies the target processor. The following
     processor names are recognized: `g5', `g6', `z900', `z990',
     `z9-109', `z9-ec', `z10' and `z196'.  Assembling an instruction
     that is not supported on the target processor results in an error
     message. Do not specify `g5' or `g6' with `-mzarch'.

`-mregnames'
     Allow symbolic names for registers.

`-mno-regnames'
     Do not allow symbolic names for registers.

`-mwarn-areg-zero'
     Warn whenever the operand for a base or index register has been
     specified but evaluates to zero. This can indicate the misuse of
     general purpose register 0 as an address register.

9.38.2 Special Characters
-------------------------

`#' is the line comment character.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

9.38.3 Instruction syntax
-------------------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the syntax outlined in Enterprise
Systems Architecture/390 Principles of Operation (SA22-7201) and the
z/Architecture Principles of Operation (SA22-7832).

   Each instruction has two major parts, the instruction mnemonic and
the instruction operands. The instruction format varies.

9.38.3.1 Register naming
........................

The `as' recognizes a number of predefined symbols for the various
processor registers. A register specification in one of the instruction
formats is an unsigned integer between 0 and 15. The specific
instruction and the position of the register in the instruction format
denotes the type of the register. The register symbols are prefixed with
`%':

     %rN   the 16 general purpose registers, 0 <= N <= 15
     %fN   the 16 floating point registers, 0 <= N <= 15
     %aN   the 16 access registers, 0 <= N <= 15
     %cN   the 16 control registers, 0 <= N <= 15
     %lit  an alias for the general purpose register %r13
     %sp   an alias for the general purpose register %r15

9.38.3.2 Instruction Mnemonics
..............................

All instructions documented in the Principles of Operation are supported
with the mnemonic and order of operands as described.  The instruction
mnemonic identifies the instruction format (*note s390 Formats::) and
the specific operation code for the instruction.  For example, the `lr'
mnemonic denotes the instruction format `RR' with the operation code
`0x18'.

   The definition of the various mnemonics follows a scheme, where the
first character usually hint at the type of the instruction:

     a          add instruction, for example `al' for add logical 32-bit
     b          branch instruction, for example `bc' for branch on condition
     c          compare or convert instruction, for example `cr' for compare
                register 32-bit
     d          divide instruction, for example `dlr' devide logical register
                64-bit to 32-bit
     i          insert instruction, for example `ic' insert character
     l          load instruction, for example `ltr' load and test register
     mv         move instruction, for example `mvc' move character
     m          multiply instruction, for example `mh' multiply halfword
     n          and instruction, for example `ni' and immediate
     o          or instruction, for example `oc' or character
     sla, sll   shift left single instruction
     sra, srl   shift right single instruction
     st         store instruction, for example `stm' store multiple
     s          subtract instruction, for example `slr' subtract
                logical 32-bit
     t          test or translate instruction, of example `tm' test under mask
     x          exclusive or instruction, for example `xc' exclusive or
                character

   Certain characters at the end of the mnemonic may describe a property
of the instruction:

     c   the instruction uses a 8-bit character operand
     f   the instruction extends a 32-bit operand to 64 bit
     g   the operands are treated as 64-bit values
     h   the operand uses a 16-bit halfword operand
     i   the instruction uses an immediate operand
     l   the instruction uses unsigned, logical operands
     m   the instruction uses a mask or operates on multiple values
     r   if r is the last character, the instruction operates on registers
     y   the instruction uses 20-bit displacements

   There are many exceptions to the scheme outlined in the above lists,
in particular for the priviledged instructions. For non-priviledged
instruction it works quite well, for example the instruction `clgfr' c:
compare instruction, l: unsigned operands, g: 64-bit operands, f: 32-
to 64-bit extension, r: register operands. The instruction compares an
64-bit value in a register with the zero extended 32-bit value from a
second register.  For a complete list of all mnemonics see appendix B
in the Principles of Operation.

9.38.3.3 Instruction Operands
.............................

Instruction operands can be grouped into three classes, operands located
in registers, immediate operands, and operands in storage.

   A register operand can be located in general, floating-point, access,
or control register. The register is identified by a four-bit field.
The field containing the register operand is called the R field.

   Immediate operands are contained within the instruction and can have
8, 16 or 32 bits. The field containing the immediate operand is called
the I field. Dependent on the instruction the I field is either signed
or unsigned.

   A storage operand consists of an address and a length. The address
of a storage operands can be specified in any of these ways:

   * The content of a single general R

   * The sum of the content of a general register called the base
     register B plus the content of a displacement field D

   * The sum of the contents of two general registers called the index
     register X and the base register B plus the content of a
     displacement field

   * The sum of the current instruction address and a 32-bit signed
     immediate field multiplied by two.

   The length of a storage operand can be:

   * Implied by the instruction

   * Specified by a bitmask

   * Specified by a four-bit or eight-bit length field L

   * Specified by the content of a general register

   The notation for storage operand addresses formed from multiple
fields is as follows:

`Dn(Bn)'
     the address for operand number n is formed from the content of
     general register Bn called the base register and the displacement
     field Dn.

`Dn(Xn,Bn)'
     the address for operand number n is formed from the content of
     general register Xn called the index register, general register Bn
     called the base register and the displacement field Dn.

`Dn(Ln,Bn)'
     the address for operand number n is formed from the content of
     general regiser Bn called the base register and the displacement
     field Dn.  The length of the operand n is specified by the field
     Ln.

   The base registers Bn and the index registers Xn of a storage
operand can be skipped. If Bn and Xn are skipped, a zero will be stored
to the operand field. The notation changes as follows:

     full notation        short notation
     ------------------------------------------ 
     Dn(0,Bn)             Dn(Bn)
     Dn(0,0)              Dn
     Dn(0)                Dn
     Dn(Ln,0)             Dn(Ln)

9.38.3.4 Instruction Formats
............................

The Principles of Operation manuals lists 26 instruction formats where
some of the formats have multiple variants. For the `.insn' pseudo
directive the assembler recognizes some of the formats.  Typically, the
most general variant of the instruction format is used by the `.insn'
directive.

   The following table lists the abbreviations used in the table of
instruction formats:

     OpCode / OpCd   Part of the op code.
     Bx              Base register number for operand x.
     Dx              Displacement for operand x.
     DLx             Displacement lower 12 bits for operand x.
     DHx             Displacement higher 8-bits for operand x.
     Rx              Register number for operand x.
     Xx              Index register number for operand x.
     Ix              Signed immediate for operand x.
     Ux              Unsigned immediate for operand x.

   An instruction is two, four, or six bytes in length and must be
aligned on a 2 byte boundary. The first two bits of the instruction
specify the length of the instruction, 00 indicates a two byte
instruction, 01 and 10 indicates a four byte instruction, and 11
indicates a six byte instruction.

   The following table lists the s390 instruction formats that are
available with the `.insn' pseudo directive:

9.38.3.5 Instruction Aliases
............................

A specific bit pattern can have multiple mnemonics, for example the bit
pattern `0xa7000000' has the mnemonics `tmh' and `tmlh'. In addition,
there are a number of mnemonics recognized by `as' that are not present
in the Principles of Operation.  These are the short forms of the
branch instructions, where the condition code mask operand is encoded
in the mnemonic. This is relevant for the branch instructions, the
compare and branch instructions, and the compare and trap instructions.

   For the branch instructions there are 20 condition code strings that
can be used as part of the mnemonic in place of a mask operand in the
instruction format:

     instruction          short form
     ------------------------------------------ 
     bcr   M1,R2          b<m>r  R2
     bc    M1,D2(X2,B2)   b<m>   D2(X2,B2)
     brc   M1,I2          j<m>   I2
     brcl  M1,I2          jg<m>  I2

   In the mnemonic for a branch instruction the condition code string
<m> can be any of the following:

     o     jump on overflow / if ones
     h     jump on A high
     p     jump on plus
     nle   jump on not low or equal
     l     jump on A low
     m     jump on minus
     nhe   jump on not high or equal
     lh    jump on low or high
     ne    jump on A not equal B
     nz    jump on not zero / if not zeros
     e     jump on A equal B
     z     jump on zero / if zeroes
     nlh   jump on not low or high
     he    jump on high or equal
     nl    jump on A not low
     nm    jump on not minus / if not mixed
     le    jump on low or equal
     nh    jump on A not high
     np    jump on not plus
     no    jump on not overflow / if not ones

   For the compare and branch, and compare and trap instructions there
are 12 condition code strings that can be used as part of the mnemonic
in place of a mask operand in the instruction format:

9.38.3.6 Instruction Operand Modifier
.....................................

If a symbol modifier is attached to a symbol in an expression for an
instruction operand field, the symbol term is replaced with a reference
to an object in the global offset table (GOT) or the procedure linkage
table (PLT). The following expressions are allowed: `symbol@modifier +
constant', `symbol@modifier + label + constant', and `symbol@modifier -
label + constant'.  The term `symbol' is the symbol that will be
entered into the GOT or PLT, `label' is a local label, and `constant'
is an arbitrary expression that the assembler can evaluate to a
constant value.

   The term `(symbol + constant1)@modifier +/- label + constant2' is
also accepted but a warning message is printed and the term is
converted to `symbol@modifier +/- label + constant1 + constant2'.

`@got'
`@got12'
     The @got modifier can be used for displacement fields, 16-bit
     immediate fields and 32-bit pc-relative immediate fields. The
     @got12 modifier is synonym to @got. The symbol is added to the
     GOT. For displacement fields and 16-bit immediate fields the
     symbol term is replaced with the offset from the start of the GOT
     to the GOT slot for the symbol.  For a 32-bit pc-relative field
     the pc-relative offset to the GOT slot from the current
     instruction address is used.

`@gotent'
     The @gotent modifier can be used for 32-bit pc-relative immediate
     fields.  The symbol is added to the GOT and the symbol term is
     replaced with the pc-relative offset from the current instruction
     to the GOT slot for the symbol.

`@gotoff'
     The @gotoff modifier can be used for 16-bit immediate fields. The
     symbol term is replaced with the offset from the start of the GOT
     to the address of the symbol.

`@gotplt'
     The @gotplt modifier can be used for displacement fields, 16-bit
     immediate fields, and 32-bit pc-relative immediate fields. A
     procedure linkage table entry is generated for the symbol and a
     jump slot for the symbol is added to the GOT. For displacement
     fields and 16-bit immediate fields the symbol term is replaced
     with the offset from the start of the GOT to the jump slot for the
     symbol. For a 32-bit pc-relative field the pc-relative offset to
     the jump slot from the current instruction address is used.

`@plt'
     The @plt modifier can be used for 16-bit and 32-bit pc-relative
     immediate fields. A procedure linkage table entry is generated for
     the symbol.  The symbol term is replaced with the relative offset
     from the current instruction to the PLT entry for the symbol.

`@pltoff'
     The @pltoff modifier can be used for 16-bit immediate fields. The
     symbol term is replaced with the offset from the start of the PLT
     to the address of the symbol.

`@gotntpoff'
     The @gotntpoff modifier can be used for displacement fields. The
     symbol is added to the static TLS block and the negated offset to
     the symbol in the static TLS block is added to the GOT. The symbol
     term is replaced with the offset to the GOT slot from the start of
     the GOT.

`@indntpoff'
     The @indntpoff modifier can be used for 32-bit pc-relative
     immediate fields. The symbol is added to the static TLS block and
     the negated offset to the symbol in the static TLS block is added
     to the GOT. The symbol term is replaced with the pc-relative
     offset to the GOT slot from the current instruction address.

   For more information about the thread local storage modifiers
`gotntpoff' and `indntpoff' see the ELF extension documentation `ELF
Handling For Thread-Local Storage'.

9.38.3.7 Instruction Marker
...........................

The thread local storage instruction markers are used by the linker to
perform code optimization.

`:tls_load'
     The :tls_load marker is used to flag the load instruction in the
     initial exec TLS model that retrieves the offset from the thread
     pointer to a thread local storage variable from the GOT.

`:tls_gdcall'
     The :tls_gdcall marker is used to flag the branch-and-save
     instruction to the __tls_get_offset function in the global dynamic
     TLS model.

`:tls_ldcall'
     The :tls_ldcall marker is used to flag the branch-and-save
     instruction to the __tls_get_offset function in the local dynamic
     TLS model.

   For more information about the thread local storage instruction
marker and the linker optimizations see the ELF extension documentation
`ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage'.


File: as.info,  Node: s390 Literal Pool Entries,  Prev: s390 Instruction Marker,  Up: s390 Syntax

9.38.3.8 Literal Pool Entries
.............................

A literal pool is a collection of values. To access the values a pointer
to the literal pool is loaded to a register, the literal pool register.
Usually, register %r13 is used as the literal pool register (*note s390
Register::). Literal pool entries are created by adding the suffix
:lit1, :lit2, :lit4, or :lit8 to the end of an expression for an
instruction operand. The expression is added to the literal pool and the
operand is replaced with the offset to the literal in the literal pool.

`:lit1'
     The literal pool entry is created as an 8-bit value. An operand
     modifier must not be used for the original expression.

`:lit2'
     The literal pool entry is created as a 16 bit value. The operand
     modifier @got may be used in the original expression. The term
     `x@got:lit2' will put the got offset for the global symbol x to
     the literal pool as 16 bit value.

`:lit4'
     The literal pool entry is created as a 32-bit value. The operand
     modifier @got and @plt may be used in the original expression. The
     term `x@got:lit4' will put the got offset for the global symbol x
     to the literal pool as a 32-bit value. The term `x@plt:lit4' will
     put the plt offset for the global symbol x to the literal pool as
     a 32-bit value.

`:lit8'
     The literal pool entry is created as a 64-bit value. The operand
     modifier @got and @plt may be used in the original expression. The
     term `x@got:lit8' will put the got offset for the global symbol x
     to the literal pool as a 64-bit value. The term `x@plt:lit8' will
     put the plt offset for the global symbol x to the literal pool as
     a 64-bit value.

   The assembler directive `.ltorg' is used to emit all literal pool
entries to the current position.

9.38.4 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

`as' for s390 supports all of the standard ELF assembler directives as
outlined in the main part of this document.  Some directives have been
extended and there are some additional directives, which are only
available for the s390 `as'.

`.insn'
     This directive permits the numeric representation of an
     instructions and makes the assembler insert the operands according
     to one of the instructions formats for `.insn' (*note s390
     Formats::).  For example, the instruction `l %r1,24(%r15)' could
     be written as `.insn rx,0x58000000,%r1,24(%r15)'.  

`.short'
`.long'
`.quad'
     This directive places one or more 16-bit (.short), 32-bit (.long),
     or 64-bit (.quad) values into the current section. If an ELF or
     TLS modifier is used only the following expressions are allowed:
     `symbol@modifier + constant', `symbol@modifier + label +
     constant', and `symbol@modifier - label + constant'.  The
     following modifiers are available:
    `@got'
    `@got12'
          The @got modifier can be used for .short, .long and .quad.
          The @got12 modifier is synonym to @got. The symbol is added
          to the GOT. The symbol term is replaced with offset from the
          start of the GOT to the GOT slot for the symbol.

    `@gotoff'
          The @gotoff modifier can be used for .short, .long and .quad.
          The symbol term is replaced with the offset from the start of
          the GOT to the address of the symbol.

    `@gotplt'
          The @gotplt modifier can be used for .long and .quad. A
          procedure linkage table entry is generated for the symbol and
          a jump slot for the symbol is added to the GOT. The symbol
          term is replaced with the offset from the start of the GOT to
          the jump slot for the symbol.

    `@plt'
          The @plt modifier can be used for .long and .quad. A
          procedure linkage table entry us generated for the symbol.
          The symbol term is replaced with the address of the PLT entry
          for the symbol.

    `@pltoff'
          The @pltoff modifier can be used for .short, .long and .quad.
          The symbol term is replaced with the offset from the start of
          the PLT to the address of the symbol.

    `@tlsgd'
    `@tlsldm'
          The @tlsgd and @tlsldm modifier can be used for .long and
          .quad. A tls_index structure for the symbol is added to the
          GOT. The symbol term is replaced with the offset from the
          start of the GOT to the tls_index structure.

    `@gotntpoff'
    `@indntpoff'
          The @gotntpoff and @indntpoff modifier can be used for .long
          and .quad.  The symbol is added to the static TLS block and
          the negated offset to the symbol in the static TLS block is
          added to the GOT. For @gotntpoff the symbol term is replaced
          with the offset from the start of the GOT to the GOT slot,
          for @indntpoff the symbol term is replaced with the address
          of the GOT slot.

    `@dtpoff'
          The @dtpoff modifier can be used for .long and .quad. The
          symbol term is replaced with the offset of the symbol
          relative to the start of the TLS block it is contained in.

    `@ntpoff'
          The @ntpoff modifier can be used for .long and .quad. The
          symbol term is replaced with the offset of the symbol
          relative to the TCB pointer.

     For more information about the thread local storage modifiers see
     the ELF extension documentation `ELF Handling For Thread-Local
     Storage'.

`.ltorg'
     This directive causes the current contents of the literal pool to
     be dumped to the current location (*note s390 Literal Pool
     Entries::).

`.machine string'
     This directive allows you to change the machine for which code is
     generated.  `string' may be any of the `-march=' selection options
     (without the -march=), `push', or `pop'.  `.machine push' saves
     the currently selected cpu, which may be restored with `.machine
     pop'.  Be aware that the cpu string has to be put into double
     quotes in case it contains characters not appropriate for
     identifiers.  So you have to write `"z9-109"' instead of just
     `z9-109'.

`.machinemode string'
     This directive allows to change the architecture mode for which
     code is being generated.  `string' may be `esa', `zarch',
     `zarch_nohighgprs', `push', or `pop'.  `.machinemode
     zarch_nohighgprs' can be used to prevent the `highgprs' flag from
     being set in the ELF header of the output file.  This is useful in
     situations where the code is gated with a runtime check which
     makes sure that the code is only executed on kernels providing the
     `highgprs' feature.  `.machinemode push' saves the currently
     selected mode, which may be restored with `.machinemode pop'.

9.38.5 Floating Point
---------------------

The assembler recognizes both the IEEE floating-point instruction and
the hexadecimal floating-point instructions. The floating-point
constructors `.float', `.single', and `.double' always emit the IEEE
format. To assemble hexadecimal floating-point constants the `.long'
and `.quad' directives must be used.

9.40.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`!' is the line comment character.

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.40.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0', `r1', `r2', `r3', `r4', `r5',
`r6', `r7', `r8', `r9', `r10', `r11', `r12', `r13', `r14', and `r15' to
refer to the SH registers.

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

`sr'
     status register

`gbr'
     global base register

`vbr'
     vector base register (for interrupt vectors)

9.40.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

`as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data

9.40.3 Floating Point
---------------------

SH2E, SH3E and SH4 groups have on-chip floating-point unit (FPU). Other
SH groups can use `.float' directive to generate IEEE floating-point
numbers.

   SH2E and SH3E support single-precision floating point calculations as
well as entirely PCAPI compatible emulation of double-precision
floating point calculations. SH2E and SH3E instructions are a subset of
the floating point calculations conforming to the IEEE754 standard.

   In addition to single-precision and double-precision floating-point
operation capability, the on-chip FPU of SH4 has a 128-bit graphic
engine that enables 32-bit floating-point data to be processed 128 bits
at a time. It also supports 4 * 4 array operations and inner product
operations. Also, a superscalar architecture is employed that enables
simultaneous execution of two instructions (including FPU
instructions), providing performance of up to twice that of
conventional architectures at the same frequency.

9.40.4 SH Machine Directives
----------------------------

`uaword'
`ualong'
`uaquad'
     `as' will issue a warning when a misaligned `.word', `.long', or
     `.quad' directive is used.  You may use `.uaword', `.ualong', or
     `.uaquad' to indicate that the value is intentionally misaligned.

9.40.5 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Renesas) or `SH-4 32-bit CPU Core
Architecture' (SuperH) and `SuperH (SH) 64-Bit RISC Series' (SuperH).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:

`-isa=dsp'
     Enable sh-dsp insns, and disable sh3e / sh4 insns.

`-isa=fp'
     Enable sh2e, sh3e, sh4, and sh4a insn sets.

`-isa=all'
     Enable sh1, sh2, sh2e, sh3, sh3e, sh4, sh4a, and sh-dsp insn sets.

`-isa=shmedia | -isa=shcompact'
     Specify the default instruction set.  `SHmedia' specifies the
     32-bit opcodes, and `SHcompact' specifies the 16-bit opcodes
     compatible with previous SH families.  The default depends on the
     ABI selected; the default for the 64-bit ABI is SHmedia, and the
     default for the 32-bit ABI is SHcompact.  If neither the ABI nor
     the ISA is specified, the default is 32-bit SHcompact.

     Note that the `.mode' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ISA is not
     specified on the command line.

`-abi=32 | -abi=64'
     Specify the default ABI.  If the ISA is specified and the ABI is
     not, the default ABI depends on the ISA, with SHmedia defaulting
     to 64-bit and SHcompact defaulting to 32-bit.

     Note that the `.abi' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ABI is not
     specified on the command line.  When the ABI is specified on the
     command line, any `.abi' pseudo-ops in the source must match it.

`-shcompact-const-crange'
     Emit code-range descriptors for constants in SHcompact code
     sections.

`-no-mix'
     Disallow SHmedia code in the same section as constants and
     SHcompact code.

`-no-expand'
     Do not expand MOVI, PT, PTA or PTB instructions.

`-expand-pt32'
     With -abi=64, expand PT, PTA and PTB instructions to 32 bits only.

`-h-tick-hex'
     Support H'00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.

9.41.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to the
SH64 general registers, `cr0' through `cr63' for control registers,
`tr0' through `tr7' for target address registers, `fr0' through `fr63'
for single-precision floating point registers, `dr0' through `dr62'
(even numbered registers only) for double-precision floating point
registers, `fv0' through `fv60' (multiples of four only) for
single-precision floating point vectors, `fp0' through `fp62' (even
numbered registers only) for single-precision floating point pairs,
`mtrx0' through `mtrx48' (multiples of 16 only) for 4x4 matrices of
single-precision floating point registers, `pc' for the program
counter, and `fpscr' for the floating point status and control register.

   You can also refer to the control registers by the mnemonics `sr',
`ssr', `pssr', `intevt', `expevt', `pexpevt', `tra', `spc', `pspc',
`resvec', `vbr', `tea', `dcr', `kcr0', `kcr1', `ctc', and `usr'.


File: as.info,  Node: SH64-Addressing,  Prev: SH64-Regs,  Up: SH64 Syntax

9.41.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

SH64 operands consist of either a register or immediate value.  The
immediate value can be a constant or label reference (or portion of a
label reference), as in this example:

     	movi	4,r2
     	pt	function, tr4
     	movi	(function >> 16) & 65535,r0
     	shori	function & 65535, r0
     	ld.l	r0,4,r0

   Instruction label references can reference labels in either SHmedia
or SHcompact.  To differentiate between the two, labels in SHmedia
sections will always have the least significant bit set (i.e. they will
be odd), which SHcompact labels will have the least significant bit
reset (i.e. they will be even).  If you need to reference the actual
address of a label, you can use the `datalabel' modifier, as in this
example:

     	.long	function
     	.long	datalabel function

   In that example, the first longword may or may not have the least
significant bit set depending on whether the label is an SHmedia label
or an SHcompact label.  The second longword will be the actual address
of the label, regardless of what type of label it is.

9.41.3 SH64 Machine Directives
------------------------------

In addition to the SH directives, the SH64 provides the following
directives:

`.mode [shmedia|shcompact]'
`.isa [shmedia|shcompact]'
     Specify the ISA for the following instructions (the two directives
     are equivalent).  Note that programs such as `objdump' rely on
     symbolic labels to determine when such mode switches occur (by
     checking the least significant bit of the label's address), so
     such mode/isa changes should always be followed by a label (in
     practice, this is true anyway).  Note that you cannot use these
     directives if you didn't specify an ISA on the command line.

`.abi [32|64]'
     Specify the ABI for the following instructions.  Note that you
     cannot use this directive unless you specified an ABI on the
     command line, and the ABIs specified must match.

9.41.4 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH64 machine instruction set, see
`SuperH 64 bit RISC Series Architecture Manual' (SuperH, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH64 opcodes.  In addition, the
following pseudo-opcodes may be expanded into one or more alternate
opcodes:

`movi'
     If the value doesn't fit into a standard `movi' opcode, `as' will
     replace the `movi' with a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcodes.

`pt'
     This expands to a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcode, followed
     by a `ptrel' opcode, or to a `pta' or `ptb' opcode, depending on
     the label referenced.

--------------

The SPARC chip family includes several successive versions, using the
same core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions
at each version.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on
what instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's
architecture reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
past sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Aleon | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
`-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av8plusb | -Av8plusc | -Av8plusd | -Av8plusv'
`-Av9 | -Av9a | -Av9b | -Av9c | -Av9d | -Av9v'
`-Asparc | -Asparcvis | -Asparcvis2 | -Asparcfmaf | -Asparcima'
`-Asparcvis3 | -Asparcvis3r'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring an incompatible or higher level.

     `-Av8plus', `-Av8plusa', `-Av8plusb', `-Av8plusc', `-Av8plusd',
     and `-Av8plusv' select a 32 bit environment.

     `-Av9', `-Av9a', `-Av9b', `-Av9c', `-Av9d', and `-Av9v' select a
     64 bit environment and are not available unless GAS is explicitly
     configured with 64 bit environment support.

     `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC VIS 1.0 extensions.

     `-Av8plusb' and `-Av9b' enable the UltraSPARC VIS 2.0 instructions,
     as well as the instructions enabled by `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a'.

     `-Av8plusc' and `-Av9c' enable the UltraSPARC Niagara instructions,
     as well as the instructions enabled by `-Av8plusb' and `-Av9b'.

     `-Av8plusd' and `-Av9d' enable the floating point fused
     multiply-add, VIS 3.0, and HPC extension instructions, as well as
     the instructions enabled by `-Av8plusc' and `-Av9c'.

     `-Av8plusv' and `-Av9v' enable the 'random', transactional memory,
     floating point unfused multiply-add, integer multiply-add, and
     cache sparing store instructions, as well as the instructions
     enabled by `-Av8plusd' and `-Av9d'.

     `-Asparc' specifies a v9 environment.  It is equivalent to `-Av9'
     if the word size is 64-bit, and `-Av8plus' otherwise.

     `-Asparcvis' specifies a v9a environment.  It is equivalent to
     `-Av9a' if the word size is 64-bit, and `-Av8plusa' otherwise.

     `-Asparcvis2' specifies a v9b environment.  It is equivalent to
     `-Av9b' if the word size is 64-bit, and `-Av8plusb' otherwise.

     `-Asparcfmaf' specifies a v9b environment with the floating point
     fused multiply-add instructions enabled.

     `-Asparcima' specifies a v9b environment with the integer
     multiply-add instructions enabled.

     `-Asparcvis3' specifies a v9b environment with the VIS 3.0, HPC ,
     and floating point fused multiply-add instructions enabled.

     `-Asparcvis3r' specifies a v9b environment with the VIS 3.0, HPC,
     transactional memory, random, and floating point unfused
     multiply-add instructions enabled.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa | -xarch=v8plusb | -xarch=v8plusc'

`-xarch=sparcfmaf | -xarch=sparcima | -xarch=sparcvis3'
`-xarch=sparcvis3r'
     For compatibility with the SunOS v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av8plus, -Av8plusa, -Av8plusb, -Av8plusc, -Av8plusd,
     -Av8plusv, -Av9, -Av9a, -Av9b, -Av9c, -Av9d, -Av9v, -Asparc,
     -Asparcvis, -Asparcvis2, -Asparcfmaf, -Asparcima, -Asparcvis3, and
     -Asparcvis3r, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

`-32 | -64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  These options
     are only available with the ELF object file format, and require
     that the necessary BFD support has been included.

9.42.2 Enforcing aligned data
-----------------------------

SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the `.long' pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS assemblers issue an error when they see misaligned
data.

   You can use the `--enforce-aligned-data' option to make SPARC GAS
also issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS assemblers
do.

   The `--enforce-aligned-data' option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the `packed' attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

9.42.3 Sparc Syntax
-------------------

The assembler syntax closely follows The Sparc Architecture Manual,
versions 8 and 9, as well as most extensions defined by Sun for their
UltraSPARC and Niagara line of processors.

9.42.3.1 Special Characters
...........................

A `!' character appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   `;' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

9.42.3.2 Register Names
.......................

The Sparc integer register file is broken down into global, outgoing,
local, and incoming.

   * The 8 global registers are referred to as `%gN'.

   * The 8 outgoing registers are referred to as `%oN'.

   * The 8 local registers are referred to as `%lN'.

   * The 8 incoming registers are referred to as `%iN'.

   * The frame pointer register `%i6' can be referenced using the alias
     `%fp'.

   * The stack pointer register `%o6' can be referenced using the alias
     `%sp'.

   Floating point registers are simply referred to as `%fN'.  When
assembling for pre-V9, only 32 floating point registers are available.
For V9 and later there are 64, but there are restrictions when
referencing the upper 32 registers.  They can only be accessed as
double or quad, and thus only even or quad numbered accesses are
allowed.  For example, `%f34' is a legal floating point register, but
`%f35' is not.

   Certain V9 instructions allow access to ancillary state registers.
Most simply they can be referred to as `%asrN' where N can be from 16
to 31.  However, there are some aliases defined to reference ASR
registers defined for various UltraSPARC processors:

   * The tick compare register is referred to as `%tick_cmpr'.

   * The system tick register is referred to as `%stick'.  An alias,
     `%sys_tick', exists but is deprecated and should not be used by
     new software.

   * The system tick compare register is referred to as `%stick_cmpr'.
     An alias, `%sys_tick_cmpr', exists but is deprecated and should
     not be used by new software.

   * The software interrupt register is referred to as `%softint'.

   * The set software interrupt register is referred to as
     `%set_softint'.  The mnemonic `%softint_set' is provided as an
     alias.

   * The clear software interrupt register is referred to as
     `%clear_softint'.  The mnemonic `%softint_clear' is provided as an
     alias.

   * The graphics status register is referred to as `%gsr'.

   * The V9 dispatch control register is referred to as `%dcr'.

   Various V9 branch and conditional move instructions allow
specification of which set of integer condition codes to test.  These
are referred to as `%xcc' and `%icc'.

   In V9, there are 4 sets of floating point condition codes which are
referred to as `%fccN'.

   Several special privileged and non-privileged registers exist:

   * The V9 address space identifier register is referred to as `%asi'.

9.42.3.3 Constants
..................

Several Sparc instructions take an immediate operand field for which
mnemonic names exist.  Two such examples are `membar' and `prefetch'.
Another example are the set of V9 memory access instruction that allow
specification of an address space identifier.

   The `membar' instruction specifies a memory barrier that is the
defined by the operand which is a bitmask.  The supported mask
mnemonics are:

   * `#Sync' requests that all operations (including nonmemory
     reference operations) appearing prior to the `membar' must have
     been performed and the effects of any exceptions become visible
     before any instructions after the `membar' may be initiated.  This
     corresponds to `membar' cmask field bit 2.

   * `#MemIssue' requests that all memory reference operations
     appearing prior to the `membar' must have been performed before
     any memory operation after the `membar' may be initiated.  This
     corresponds to `membar' cmask field bit 1.

   * `#Lookaside' requests that a store appearing prior to the `membar'
     must complete before any load following the `membar' referencing
     the same address can be initiated.  This corresponds to `membar'
     cmask field bit 0.

   * `#StoreStore' defines that the effects of all stores appearing
     prior to the `membar' instruction must be visible to all
     processors before the effect of any stores following the `membar'.
     Equivalent to the deprecated `stbar' instruction.  This
     corresponds to `membar' mmask field bit 3.

   * `#LoadStore' defines all loads appearing prior to the `membar'
     instruction must have been performed before the effect of any
     stores following the `membar' is visible to any other processor.
     This corresponds to `membar' mmask field bit 2.

   * `#StoreLoad' defines that the effects of all stores appearing
     prior to the `membar' instruction must be visible to all
     processors before loads following the `membar' may be performed.
     This corresponds to `membar' mmask field bit 1.

   * `#LoadLoad' defines that all loads appearing prior to the `membar'
     instruction must have been performed before any loads following
     the `membar' may be performed.  This corresponds to `membar' mmask
     field bit 0.


   These values can be ored together, for example:

     membar #Sync
     membar #StoreLoad | #LoadLoad
     membar #StoreLoad | #StoreStore

   The `prefetch' and `prefetcha' instructions take a prefetch function
code.  The following prefetch function code constant mnemonics are
available:

   * `#n_reads' requests a prefetch for several reads, and corresponds
     to a prefetch function code of 0.

     `#one_read' requests a prefetch for one read, and corresponds to a
     prefetch function code of 1.

     `#n_writes' requests a prefetch for several writes (and possibly
     reads), and corresponds to a prefetch function code of 2.

     `#one_write' requests a prefetch for one write, and corresponds to
     a prefetch function code of 3.

     `#page' requests a prefetch page, and corresponds to a prefetch
     function code of 4.

     `#invalidate' requests a prefetch invalidate, and corresponds to a
     prefetch function code of 16.

     `#unified' requests a prefetch to the nearest unified cache, and
     corresponds to a prefetch function code of 17.

     `#n_reads_strong' requests a strong prefetch for several reads,
     and corresponds to a prefetch function code of 20.

     `#one_read_strong' requests a strong prefetch for one read, and
     corresponds to a prefetch function code of 21.

     `#n_writes_strong' requests a strong prefetch for several writes,
     and corresponds to a prefetch function code of 22.

     `#one_write_strong' requests a strong prefetch for one write, and
     corresponds to a prefetch function code of 23.

     Onle one prefetch code may be specified.  Here are some examples:

          prefetch  [%l0 + %l2], #one_read
          prefetch  [%g2 + 8], #n_writes
          prefetcha [%g1] 0x8, #unified
          prefetcha [%o0 + 0x10] %asi, #n_reads

     The actual behavior of a given prefetch function code is processor
     specific.  If a processor does not implement a given prefetch
     function code, it will treat the prefetch instruction as a nop.

     For instructions that accept an immediate address space identifier,
     `as' provides many mnemonics corresponding to V9 defined as well
     as UltraSPARC and Niagara extended values.  For example, `#ASI_P'
     and `#ASI_BLK_INIT_QUAD_LDD_AIUS'.  See the V9 and processor
     specific manuals for details.

9.42.3.4 Relocations
....................

ELF relocations are available as defined in the 32-bit and 64-bit Sparc
ELF specifications.

   `R_SPARC_HI22' is obtained using `%hi' and `R_SPARC_LO10' is
obtained using `%lo'.  Likewise `R_SPARC_HIX22' is obtained from `%hix'
and `R_SPARC_LOX10' is obtained using `%lox'.  For example:

     sethi %hi(symbol), %g1
     or    %g1, %lo(symbol), %g1

     sethi %hix(symbol), %g1
     xor   %g1, %lox(symbol), %g1

   These "high" mnemonics extract bits 31:10 of their operand, and the
"low" mnemonics extract bits 9:0 of their operand.

   V9 code model relocations can be requested as follows:

   * `R_SPARC_HH22' is requested using `%hh'.  It can also be generated
     using `%uhi'.

   * `R_SPARC_HM10' is requested using `%hm'.  It can also be generated
     using `%ulo'.

   * `R_SPARC_LM22' is requested using `%lm'.

   * `R_SPARC_H44' is requested using `%h44'.

   * `R_SPARC_M44' is requested using `%m44'.

   * `R_SPARC_L44' is requested using `%l44' or `%l34'.

   * `R_SPARC_H34' is requested using `%h34'.

   The `%l34' generates a `R_SPARC_L44' relocation because it
calculates the necessary value, and therefore no explicit `R_SPARC_L34'
relocation needed to be created for this purpose.

   The `%h34' and `%l34' relocations are used for the abs34 code model.
Here is an example abs34 address generation sequence:

     sethi %h34(symbol), %g1
     sllx  %g1, 2, %g1
     or    %g1, %l34(symbol), %g1

   The PC relative relocation `R_SPARC_PC22' can be obtained by
enclosing an operand inside of `%pc22'.  Likewise, the `R_SPARC_PC10'
relocation can be obtained using `%pc10'.  These are mostly used when
assembling PIC code.  For example, the standard PIC sequence on Sparc
to get the base of the global offset table, PC relative, into a
register, can be performed as:

     sethi %pc22(_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_-4), %l7
     add   %l7, %pc10(_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+4), %l7

   Several relocations exist to allow the link editor to potentially
optimize GOT data references.  The `R_SPARC_GOTDATA_OP_HIX22'
relocation can obtained by enclosing an operand inside of
`%gdop_hix22'.  The `R_SPARC_GOTDATA_OP_LOX10' relocation can obtained
by enclosing an operand inside of `%gdop_lox10'.  Likewise,
`R_SPARC_GOTDATA_OP' can be obtained by enclosing an operand inside of
`%gdop'.  For example, assuming the GOT base is in register `%l7':

     sethi %gdop_hix22(symbol), %l1
     xor   %l1, %gdop_lox10(symbol), %l1
     ld    [%l7 + %l1], %l2, %gdop(symbol)

   There are many relocations that can be requested for access to
thread local storage variables.  All of the Sparc TLS mnemonics are
supported:

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_HI22' is requested using `%tgd_hi22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_LO10' is requested using `%tgd_lo10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_ADD' is requested using `%tgd_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_GD_CALL' is requested using `%tgd_call'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_HI22' is requested using `%tldm_hi22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_LO10' is requested using `%tldm_lo10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_ADD' is requested using `%tldm_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDM_CALL' is requested using `%tldm_call'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDO_HIX22' is requested using `%tldo_hix22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDO_LOX10' is requested using `%tldo_lox10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LDO_ADD' is requested using `%tldo_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_HI22' is requested using `%tie_hi22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_LO10' is requested using `%tie_lo10'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_LD' is requested using `%tie_ld'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_LDX' is requested using `%tie_ldx'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_IE_ADD' is requested using `%tie_add'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LE_HIX22' is requested using `%tle_hix22'.

   * `R_SPARC_TLS_LE_LOX10' is requested using `%tle_lox10'.

   Here are some example TLS model sequences.

   First, General Dynamic:

     sethi  %tgd_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tgd_lo10(symbol), %l1
     add    %l7, %l1, %o0, %tgd_add(symbol)
     call   __tls_get_addr, %tgd_call(symbol)
     nop

   Local Dynamic:

     sethi  %tldm_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tldm_lo10(symbol), %l1
     add    %l7, %l1, %o0, %tldm_add(symbol)
     call   __tls_get_addr, %tldm_call(symbol)
     nop

     sethi  %tldo_hix22(symbol), %l1
     xor    %l1, %tldo_lox10(symbol), %l1
     add    %o0, %l1, %l1, %tldo_add(symbol)

   Initial Exec:

     sethi  %tie_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tie_lo10(symbol), %l1
     ld     [%l7 + %l1], %o0, %tie_ld(symbol)
     add    %g7, %o0, %o0, %tie_add(symbol)

     sethi  %tie_hi22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tie_lo10(symbol), %l1
     ldx    [%l7 + %l1], %o0, %tie_ldx(symbol)
     add    %g7, %o0, %o0, %tie_add(symbol)

   And finally, Local Exec:

     sethi  %tle_hix22(symbol), %l1
     add    %l1, %tle_lox10(symbol), %l1
     add    %g7, %l1, %l1

   When assembling for 64-bit, and a secondary constant addend is
specified in an address expression that would normally generate an
`R_SPARC_LO10' relocation, the assembler will emit an `R_SPARC_OLO10'
instead.

9.42.3.5 Size Translations
..........................

Often it is desirable to write code in an operand size agnostic manner.
`as' provides support for this via operand size opcode translations.
Translations are supported for loads, stores, shifts, compare-and-swap
atomics, and the `clr' synthetic instruction.

   If generating 32-bit code, `as' will generate the 32-bit opcode.
Whereas if 64-bit code is being generated, the 64-bit opcode will be
emitted.  For example `ldn' will be transformed into `ld' for 32-bit
code and `ldx' for 64-bit code.

   Here is an example meant to demonstrate all the supported opcode
translations:

     ldn   [%o0], %o1
     ldna  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     stn   %o1, [%o0]
     stna  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     slln  %o3, 3, %o3
     srln  %o4, 8, %o4
     sran  %o5, 12, %o5
     casn  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casna [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clrn  %g1

   In 32-bit mode `as' will emit:

     ld   [%o0], %o1
     lda  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     st   %o1, [%o0]
     sta  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     sll  %o3, 3, %o3
     srl  %o4, 8, %o4
     sra  %o5, 12, %o5
     cas  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casa [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clr  %g1

   And in 64-bit mode `as' will emit:

     ldx   [%o0], %o1
     ldxa  [%o0] %asi, %o2
     stx   %o1, [%o0]
     stxa  %o2, [%o0] %asi
     sllx  %o3, 3, %o3
     srlx  %o4, 8, %o4
     srax  %o5, 12, %o5
     casx  [%o0], %o1, %o2
     casxa [%o0] %asi, %o1, %o2
     clrx  %g1

   Finally, the `.nword' translating directive is supported as well.
It is documented in the section on Sparc machine directives.

The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

9.42.5 Sparc Machine Directives
-------------------------------

The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just suppresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

9.43.1 Options
--------------

The TMS320C54X version of `as' has a few machine-dependent options.

   You can use the `-mfar-mode' option to enable extended addressing
mode.  All addresses will be assumed to be > 16 bits, and the
appropriate relocation types will be used.  This option is equivalent
to using the `.far_mode' directive in the assembly code.  If you do not
use the `-mfar-mode' option, all references will be assumed to be 16
bits.  This option may be abbreviated to `-mf'.

   You can use the `-mcpu' option to specify a particular CPU.  This
option is equivalent to using the `.version' directive in the assembly
code.  For recognized CPU codes, see *Note `.version':
TIC54X-Directives.  The default CPU version is `542'.

   You can use the `-merrors-to-file' option to redirect error output
to a file (this provided for those deficient environments which don't
provide adequate output redirection).  This option may be abbreviated to
`-me'.

9.43.2 Blocking
---------------

A blocked section or memory block is guaranteed not to cross the
blocking boundary (usually a page, or 128 words) if it is smaller than
the blocking size, or to start on a page boundary if it is larger than
the blocking size.

9.43.3 Environment Settings
---------------------------

`C54XDSP_DIR' and `A_DIR' are semicolon-separated paths which are added
to the list of directories normally searched for source and include
files.  `C54XDSP_DIR' will override `A_DIR'.

9.43.4 Constants Syntax
-----------------------

The TIC54X version of `as' allows the following additional constant
formats, using a suffix to indicate the radix:

     Binary                  `000000B, 011000b'
     Octal                   `10Q, 224q'
     Hexadecimal             `45h, 0FH'

9.43.5 String Substitution
--------------------------

A subset of allowable symbols (which we'll call subsyms) may be assigned
arbitrary string values.  This is roughly equivalent to C preprocessor
#define macros.  When `as' encounters one of these symbols, the symbol
is replaced in the input stream by its string value.  Subsym names
*must* begin with a letter.

   Subsyms may be defined using the `.asg' and `.eval' directives
(*Note `.asg': TIC54X-Directives, *Note `.eval': TIC54X-Directives.

   Expansion is recursive until a previously encountered symbol is
seen, at which point substitution stops.

   In this example, x is replaced with SYM2; SYM2 is replaced with
SYM1, and SYM1 is replaced with x.  At this point, x has already been
encountered and the substitution stops.

      .asg   "x",SYM1
      .asg   "SYM1",SYM2
      .asg   "SYM2",x
      add    x,a             ; final code assembled is "add  x, a"

   Macro parameters are converted to subsyms; a side effect of this is
the normal `as' '\ARG' dereferencing syntax is unnecessary.  Subsyms
defined within a macro will have global scope, unless the `.var'
directive is used to identify the subsym as a local macro variable
*note `.var': TIC54X-Directives.

   Substitution may be forced in situations where replacement might be
ambiguous by placing colons on either side of the subsym.  The following
code:

      .eval  "10",x
     LAB:X:  add     #x, a

   When assembled becomes:

     LAB10  add     #10, a

   Smaller parts of the string assigned to a subsym may be accessed with
the following syntax:

``:SYMBOL(CHAR_INDEX):''
     Evaluates to a single-character string, the character at
     CHAR_INDEX.

``:SYMBOL(START,LENGTH):''
     Evaluates to a substring of SYMBOL beginning at START with length
     LENGTH.

9.43.6 Local Labels
-------------------

Local labels may be defined in two ways:

   * $N, where N is a decimal number between 0 and 9

   * LABEL?, where LABEL is any legal symbol name.

   Local labels thus defined may be redefined or automatically
generated.  The scope of a local label is based on when it may be
undefined or reset.  This happens when one of the following situations
is encountered:

   * .newblock directive *note `.newblock': TIC54X-Directives.

   * The current section is changed (.sect, .text, or .data)

   * Entering or leaving an included file

   * The macro scope where the label was defined is exited

9.43.8 Extended Addressing
--------------------------

The `LDX' pseudo-op is provided for loading the extended addressing bits
of a label or address.  For example, if an address `_label' resides in
extended program memory, the value of `_label' may be loaded as follows:
      ldx     #_label,16,a    ; loads extended bits of _label
      or      #_label,a       ; loads lower 16 bits of _label
      bacc    a               ; full address is in accumulator A

9.43.9 Directives
-----------------

`.align [SIZE]'
`.even'
     Align the section program counter on the next boundary, based on
     SIZE.  SIZE may be any power of 2.  `.even' is equivalent to
     `.align' with a SIZE of 2.
    `1'
          Align SPC to word boundary

    `2'
          Align SPC to longword boundary (same as .even)

    `128'
          Align SPC to page boundary

`.asg STRING, NAME'
     Assign NAME the string STRING.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.eval STRING, NAME'
     Evaluate the contents of string STRING and assign the result as a
     string to the subsym NAME.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.bss SYMBOL, SIZE [, [BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for SYMBOL in the .bss section.  SIZE is in words.
     If present, BLOCKING_FLAG indicates the allocated space should be
     aligned on a page boundary if it would otherwise cross a page
     boundary.  If present, ALIGNMENT_FLAG causes the assembler to
     allocate SIZE on a long word boundary.

`.byte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ubyte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.char VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uchar VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more bytes into consecutive words of the current
     section.  The upper 8 bits of each word is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the word allocated for the first byte
     encountered.

`.clink ["SECTION_NAME"]'
     Set STYP_CLINK flag for this section, which indicates to the
     linker that if no symbols from this section are referenced, the
     section should not be included in the link.  If SECTION_NAME is
     omitted, the current section is used.

`.c_mode'
     TBD.

`.copy "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
`.include "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Read source statements from FILENAME.  The normal include search
     path is used.  Normally .copy will cause statements from the
     included file to be printed in the assembly listing and .include
     will not, but this distinction is not currently implemented.

`.data'
     Begin assembling code into the .data section.

`.double VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ldouble VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.float VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xfloat VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place an IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of
     one or more floating-point values into the current section.  All
     but `.xfloat' align the result on a longword boundary.  Values are
     stored most-significant word first.

`.drlist'
`.drnolist'
     Control printing of directives to the listing file.  Ignored.

`.emsg STRING'
`.mmsg STRING'
`.wmsg STRING'
     Emit a user-defined error, message, or warning, respectively.

`.far_mode'
     Use extended addressing when assembling statements.  This should
     appear only once per file, and is equivalent to the -mfar-mode
     option *note `-mfar-mode': TIC54X-Opts.

`.fclist'
`.fcnolist'
     Control printing of false conditional blocks to the listing file.

`.field VALUE [,SIZE]'
     Initialize a bitfield of SIZE bits in the current section.  If
     VALUE is relocatable, then SIZE must be 16.  SIZE defaults to 16
     bits.  If VALUE does not fit into SIZE bits, the value will be
     truncated.  Successive `.field' directives will pack starting at
     the current word, filling the most significant bits first, and
     aligning to the start of the next word if the field size does not
     fit into the space remaining in the current word.  A `.align'
     directive with an operand of 1 will force the next `.field'
     directive to begin packing into a new word.  If a label is used, it
     points to the word that contains the specified field.

`.global SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.def SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.ref SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
     `.def' nominally identifies a symbol defined in the current file
     and available to other files.  `.ref' identifies a symbol used in
     the current file but defined elsewhere.  Both map to the standard
     `.global' directive.

`.half VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uhalf VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.short VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ushort VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.int VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uint VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.word VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uword VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more values into consecutive words of the current
     section.  If a label is used, it points to the word allocated for
     the first value encountered.

`.label SYMBOL'
     Define a special SYMBOL to refer to the load time address of the
     current section program counter.

`.length'
`.width'
     Set the page length and width of the output listing file.  Ignored.

`.list'
`.nolist'
     Control whether the source listing is printed.  Ignored.

`.long VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ulong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xlong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more 32-bit values into consecutive words in the
     current section.  The most significant word is stored first.
     `.long' and `.ulong' align the result on a longword boundary;
     `xlong' does not.

`.loop [COUNT]'
`.break [CONDITION]'
`.endloop'
     Repeatedly assemble a block of code.  `.loop' begins the block, and
     `.endloop' marks its termination.  COUNT defaults to 1024, and
     indicates the number of times the block should be repeated.
     `.break' terminates the loop so that assembly begins after the
     `.endloop' directive.  The optional CONDITION will cause the loop
     to terminate only if it evaluates to zero.

`MACRO_NAME .macro [PARAM1][,...PARAM_N]'
`[.mexit]'
`.endm'
     See the section on macros for more explanation (*Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.mlib "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Load the macro library FILENAME.  FILENAME must be an archived
     library (BFD ar-compatible) of text files, expected to contain
     only macro definitions.   The standard include search path is used.

`.mlist'
`.mnolist'
     Control whether to include macro and loop block expansions in the
     listing output.  Ignored.

`.mmregs'
     Define global symbolic names for the 'c54x registers.  Supposedly
     equivalent to executing `.set' directives for each register with
     its memory-mapped value, but in reality is provided only for
     compatibility and does nothing.

`.newblock'
     This directive resets any TIC54X local labels currently defined.
     Normal `as' local labels are unaffected.

`.option OPTION_LIST'
     Set listing options.  Ignored.

`.sblock "SECTION_NAME" | SECTION_NAME [,"NAME_N" | NAME_N]'
     Designate SECTION_NAME for blocking.  Blocking guarantees that a
     section will start on a page boundary (128 words) if it would
     otherwise cross a page boundary.  Only initialized sections may be
     designated with this directive.  See also *Note TIC54X-Block::.

`.sect "SECTION_NAME"'
     Define a named initialized section and make it the current section.

`SYMBOL .set "VALUE"'
`SYMBOL .equ "VALUE"'
     Equate a constant VALUE to a SYMBOL, which is placed in the symbol
     table.  SYMBOL may not be previously defined.

`.space SIZE_IN_BITS'
`.bes SIZE_IN_BITS'
     Reserve the given number of bits in the current section and
     zero-fill them.  If a label is used with `.space', it points to the
     *first* word reserved.  With `.bes', the label points to the
     *last* word reserved.

`.sslist'
`.ssnolist'
     Controls the inclusion of subsym replacement in the listing
     output.  Ignored.

`.string "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
`.pstring "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
     Place 8-bit characters from STRING into the current section.
     `.string' zero-fills the upper 8 bits of each word, while
     `.pstring' puts two characters into each word, filling the
     most-significant bits first.  Unused space is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the first word initialized.

`[STAG] .struct [OFFSET]'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag STAGX [TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[SSIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [STAG]'
     Assign symbolic offsets to the elements of a structure.  STAG
     defines a symbol to use to reference the structure.  OFFSET
     indicates a starting value to use for the first element
     encountered; otherwise it defaults to zero.  Each element can have
     a named offset, NAME, which is a symbol assigned the value of the
     element's offset into the structure.  If STAG is missing, these
     become global symbols.  COUNT adjusts the offset that many times,
     as if `element' were an array.  `element' may be one of `.byte',
     `.word', `.long', `.float', or any equivalent of those, and the
     structure offset is adjusted accordingly.  `.field' and `.string'
     are also allowed; the size of `.field' is one bit, and `.string'
     is considered to be one word in size.  Only element descriptors,
     structure/union tags, `.align' and conditional assembly directives
     are allowed within `.struct'/`.endstruct'.  `.align' aligns member
     offsets to word boundaries only.  SSIZE, if provided, will always
     be assigned the size of the structure.

     The `.tag' directive, in addition to being used to define a
     structure/union element within a structure, may be used to apply a
     structure to a symbol.  Once applied to LABEL, the individual
     structure elements may be applied to LABEL to produce the desired
     offsets using LABEL as the structure base.

`.tab'
     Set the tab size in the output listing.  Ignored.

`[UTAG] .union'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag UTAGX[,TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[USIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [UTAG]'
     Similar to `.struct', but the offset after each element is reset to
     zero, and the USIZE is set to the maximum of all defined elements.
     Starting offset for the union is always zero.

`[SYMBOL] .usect "SECTION_NAME", SIZE, [,[BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for variables in a named, uninitialized section
     (similar to .bss).  `.usect' allows definitions sections
     independent of .bss.  SYMBOL points to the first location reserved
     by this allocation.  The symbol may be used as a variable name.
     SIZE is the allocated size in words.  BLOCKING_FLAG indicates
     whether to block this section on a page boundary (128 words)
     (*note TIC54X-Block::).  ALIGNMENT FLAG indicates whether the
     section should be longword-aligned.

`.var SYM[,..., SYM_N]'
     Define a subsym to be a local variable within a macro.  See *Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.version VERSION'
     Set which processor to build instructions for.  Though the
     following values are accepted, the op is ignored.
    `541'
    `542'
    `543'
    `545'
    `545LP'
    `546LP'
    `548'

9.43.10 Macros
--------------

Macros do not require explicit dereferencing of arguments (i.e., \ARG).

   During macro expansion, the macro parameters are converted to
subsyms.  If the number of arguments passed the macro invocation
exceeds the number of parameters defined, the last parameter is
assigned the string equivalent of all remaining arguments.  If fewer
arguments are given than parameters, the missing parameters are
assigned empty strings.  To include a comma in an argument, you must
enclose the argument in quotes.

   The following built-in subsym functions allow examination of the
string value of subsyms (or ordinary strings).  The arguments are
strings unless otherwise indicated (subsyms passed as args will be
replaced by the strings they represent).
``$symlen(STR)''
     Returns the length of STR.

``$symcmp(STR1,STR2)''
     Returns 0 if STR1 == STR2, non-zero otherwise.

``$firstch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the first occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$lastch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the last occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$isdefed(SYMBOL)''
     Returns zero if the symbol SYMBOL is not in the symbol table,
     non-zero otherwise.

``$ismember(SYMBOL,LIST)''
     Assign the first member of comma-separated string LIST to SYMBOL;
     LIST is reassigned the remainder of the list.  Returns zero if
     LIST is a null string.  Both arguments must be subsyms.

``$iscons(EXPR)''
     Returns 1 if string EXPR is binary, 2 if octal, 3 if hexadecimal,
     4 if a character, 5 if decimal, and zero if not an integer.

``$isname(NAME)''
     Returns 1 if NAME is a valid symbol name, zero otherwise.

``$isreg(REG)''
     Returns 1 if REG is a valid predefined register name (AR0-AR7
     only).

``$structsz(STAG)''
     Returns the size of the structure or union represented by STAG.

``$structacc(STAG)''
     Returns the reference point of the structure or union represented
     by STAG.   Always returns zero.

`-march=ARCH'
     Enable (only) instructions from architecture ARCH.  By default,
     all instructions are permitted.

     The following values of ARCH are accepted: `c62x', `c64x',
     `c64x+', `c67x', `c67x+', `c674x'.

`-mdsbt'
`-mno-dsbt'
     The `-mdsbt' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_DSBT' attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
     code is using DSBT addressing.  The `-mno-dsbt' option, the
     default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that the
     code does not use DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit a warning
     if objects of different type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked
     together.

`-mpid=no'
`-mpid=near'
`-mpid=far'
     The `-mpid=' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_PID' attribute with a value indicating the form of data
     addressing used by the code.  `-mpid=no', the default, indicates
     position-dependent data addressing, `-mpid=near' indicates
     position-independent addressing with GOT accesses using near DP
     addressing, and `-mpid=far' indicates position-independent
     addressing with GOT accesses using far DP addressing.  The linker
     will emit a warning if objects built with different settings of
     this option are linked together.

`-mpic'
`-mno-pic'
     The `-mpic' option causes the assembler to generate the
     `Tag_ABI_PIC' attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
     code is using position-independent code addressing,  The
     `-mno-pic' option, the default, causes the tag to have a value of
     0, indicating position-dependent code addressing.  The linker will
     emit a warning if objects of different type (position-dependent and
     position-independent) are linked together.

`-mbig-endian'
`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is
     little-endian.

9.44.2 TIC6X Syntax
-------------------

The presence of a `;' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.  If a `#' or `*' appears as the
first character of a line, the whole line is treated as a comment.
Note that if a line starts with a `#' character then it can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `@' character can be used instead of a newline to separate
statements.

   Instruction, register and functional unit names are case-insensitive.
`as' requires fully-specified functional unit names, such as `.S1',
`.L1X' or `.D1T2', on all instructions using a functional unit.

   For some instructions, there may be syntactic ambiguity between
register or functional unit names and the names of labels or other
symbols.  To avoid this, enclose the ambiguous symbol name in
parentheses; register and functional unit names may not be enclosed in
parentheses.

9.44.3 TIC6X Directives
-----------------------

Directives controlling the set of instructions accepted by the
assembler have effect for instructions between the directive and any
subsequent directive overriding it.

`.arch ARCH'
     This has the same effect as `-march=ARCH'.

`.cantunwind'
     Prevents unwinding through the current function.  No personality
     routine or exception table data is required or permitted.

     If this is not specified then frame unwinding information will be
     constructed from CFI directives. *note CFI directives::.

`.c6xabi_attribute TAG, VALUE'
     Set the C6000 EABI build attribute TAG to VALUE.

     The TAG is either an attribute number or one of `Tag_ISA',
     `Tag_ABI_wchar_t', `Tag_ABI_stack_align_needed',
     `Tag_ABI_stack_align_preserved', `Tag_ABI_DSBT', `Tag_ABI_PID',
     `Tag_ABI_PIC', `TAG_ABI_array_object_alignment',
     `TAG_ABI_array_object_align_expected', `Tag_ABI_compatibility' and
     `Tag_ABI_conformance'.  The VALUE is either a `number',
     `"string"', or `number, "string"' depending on the tag.

`.ehtype SYMBOL'
     Output an exception type table reference to SYMBOL.

`.endp'
     Marks the end of and exception table or function.  If preceeded by
     a `.handlerdata' directive then this also switched back to the
     previous text section.

`.handlerdata'
     Marks the end of the current function, and the start of the
     exception table entry for that function.  Anything between this
     directive and the `.endp' directive will be added to the exception
     table entry.

     Must be preceded by a CFI block containing a `.cfi_lsda' directive.

`.nocmp'
     Disallow use of C64x+ compact instructions in the current text
     section.

`.personalityindex INDEX'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to the ABI
     specified compact routine number INDEX

`.personality NAME'
     Sets the personality routine for the current function to NAME.

`.scomm SYMBOL, SIZE, ALIGN'
     Like `.comm', creating a common symbol SYMBOL with size SIZE and
     alignment ALIGN, but unlike when using `.comm', this symbol will
     be placed into the small BSS section by the linker.

9.45.2 Syntax
-------------

Block comments are delimited by `/*' and `*/'.  End of line comments
may be introduced by `#'.

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon.

   There are two ways to write code: either write naked instructions,
which the assembler is free to combine into VLIW bundles, or specify
the VLIW bundles explicitly.

   Bundles are specified using curly braces:

     { ADD r3,r4,r5 ; ADD r7,r8,r9 ; LW r10,r11 }

   A bundle can span multiple lines. If you want to put multiple
instructions on a line, whether in a bundle or not, you need to
separate them with semicolons as in this example.

   A bundle may contain one or more instructions, up to the limit
specified by the ISA (currently three). If fewer instructions are
specified than the hardware supports in a bundle, the assembler inserts
`fnop' instructions automatically.

   The assembler will prefer to preserve the ordering of instructions
within the bundle, putting the first instruction in a lower-numbered
pipeline than the next one, etc.  This fact, combined with the optional
use of explicit `fnop' or `nop' instructions, allows precise control
over which pipeline executes each instruction.

   If the instructions cannot be bundled in the listed order, the
assembler will automatically try to find a valid pipeline assignment.
If there is no way to bundle the instructions together, the assembler
reports an error.

   The assembler does not yet auto-bundle (automatically combine
multiple instructions into one bundle), but it reserves the right to do
so in the future.  If you want to force an instruction to run by
itself, put it in a bundle explicitly with curly braces and use `nop'
instructions (not `fnop') to fill the remaining pipeline slots in that
bundle.

9.45.2.2 Register Names
.......................

General-purpose registers are represented by predefined symbols of the
form `rN', where N represents a number between `0' and `63'.  However,
the following registers have canonical names that must be used instead:

`r54'
     sp

`r55'
     lr

`r56'
     sn

`r57'
     idn0

`r58'

`r59'
     udn0

`r60'
     udn1

`r61'
     udn2

`r62'
     udn3

`r63'
     zero


   The assembler will emit a warning if a numeric name is used instead
of the non-numeric name.  The `.no_require_canonical_reg_names'
assembler pseudo-op turns off this warning.
`.require_canonical_reg_names' turns it back on.

9.45.2.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
...................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
TILE-Gx instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     modifier(symbol)

   The following modifiers are supported:

`hw0'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the symbol's address.

`hw1'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the symbol's address.

`hw2'
     This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the symbol's address.

`hw3'
     This modifier is used to load bits 48-63 of the symbol's address.

`hw0_last'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0', but it also checks
     that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw1', but it also checks
     that the value does not overflow.

`hw2_last'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw2', but it also checks
     that the value does not overflow.

     A 48-bit symbolic value is constructed by using the following
     idiom:

          moveli r0, hw2_last(sym)
          shl16insli r0, r0, hw1(sym)
          shl16insli r0, r0, hw0(sym)

`hw0_got'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the symbol's offset in
     the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

`hw0_last_got'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0_got', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last_got'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the symbol's offset in
     the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol, and it also checks that
     the value does not overflow.

`plt'
     This modifier is used for function symbols.  It causes a
     _procedure linkage table_, an array of code stubs, to be created
     at the time the shared object is created or linked against,
     together with a global offset table entry.  The value is a
     pc-relative offset to the corresponding stub code in the procedure
     linkage table.  This arrangement causes the run-time symbol
     resolver to be called to look up and set the value of the symbol
     the first time the function is called (at latest; depending
     environment variables).  It is only safe to leave the symbol
     unresolved this way if all references are function calls.

`hw0_plt'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the pc-relative address
     of a plt entry.

`hw1_plt'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the pc-relative
     address of a plt entry.

`hw1_last_plt'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw1_plt', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw2_last_plt'
     This modifier is used to load bits 32-47 of the pc-relative
     address of a plt entry, and it also checks that the value does not
     overflow.

`hw0_tls_gd'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the GOT
     entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for
     general-dynamic TLS accesses.

`hw0_last_tls_gd'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0_tls_gd', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last_tls_gd'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the offset of the GOT
     entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for
     general-dynamic TLS accesses.  It also checks that the value does
     not overflow.

`hw0_tls_ie'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the GOT
     entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB,
     to be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`hw0_last_tls_ie'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0_tls_ie', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last_tls_ie'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the offset of the GOT
     entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB,
     to be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.  It also checks that the
     value does not overflow.

`hw0_tls_le'
     This modifier is used to load bits 0-15 of the offset of the
     symbol's address from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS
     accesses.

`hw0_last_tls_le'
     This modifier yields the same value as `hw0_tls_le', but it also
     checks that the value does not overflow.

`hw1_last_tls_le'
     This modifier is used to load bits 16-31 of the offset of the
     symbol's address from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS
     accesses.  It also checks that the value does not overflow.

`tls_gd_call'
     This modifier is used to tag an instrution as the "call" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS GD reference of its operand.

`tls_gd_add'
     This modifier is used to tag an instruction as the "add" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS GD reference of its operand.

`tls_ie_load'
     This modifier is used to tag an instruction as the "load" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS IE reference of its operand.

9.46.2.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
...................................

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
TILEPro instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     modifier(symbol)

   The following modifiers are supported:

`lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the low 16 bits of the symbol's
     address, sign-extended to a 32-bit value (sign-extension allows it
     to be range-checked against signed 16 bit immediate operands
     without complaint).

`hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the high 16 bits of the symbol's
     address, also sign-extended to a 32-bit value.

`ha16'
     `ha16(N)' is identical to `hi16(N)', except if `lo16(N)' is
     negative it adds one to the `hi16(N)' value. This way `lo16' and
     `ha16' can be added to create any 32-bit value using `auli'.  For
     example, here is how you move an arbitrary 32-bit address into r3:

          moveli r3, lo16(sym)
          auli r3, r3, ha16(sym)

`got'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the GOT entry
     corresponding to the symbol.

`got_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended low 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

`got_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended high 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry corresponding to the symbol.

`got_ha16'
     This modifier is like `got_hi16', but it adds one if `got_lo16' of
     the input value is negative.

`plt'
     This modifier is used for function symbols.  It causes a
     _procedure linkage table_, an array of PK
     cOb      	   1/1.z2192code stubs, to be created
     at the time the shared object is created or linked against,
     together with a global offset table entry.  The value is a
     pc-relative offset to the corresponding stub code in the procedure
     linkage table.  This arrangement causes the run-time symbol
     resolver to be called to look up and set the value of the symbol
     the first time the function is called (at latest; depending
     environment variables).  It is only safe to leave the symbol
     unresolved this way if all references are function calls.

`tls_gd'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the GOT entry of the
     symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used for general-dynamic TLS
     accesses.

`tls_gd_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended low 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used
     for general dynamic TLS accesses.

`tls_gd_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the sign-extended high 16 bits of the
     offset of the GOT entry of the symbol's TLS descriptor, to be used
     for general dynamic TLS accesses.

`tls_gd_ha16'
     This modifier is like `tls_gd_hi16', but it adds one to the value
     if `tls_gd_lo16' of the input value is negative.

`tls_ie'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the GOT entry
     containing the offset of the symbol's address from the TCB, to be
     used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_ie_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the low 16 bits of the offset of the
     GOT entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the
     TCB, to be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_ie_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the high 16 bits of the offset of the
     GOT entry containing the offset of the symbol's address from the
     TCB, to be used for initial-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_ie_ha16'
     This modifier is like `tls_ie_hi16', but it adds one to the value
     if `tls_ie_lo16' of the input value is negative.

`tls_le'
     This modifier is used to load the offset of the symbol's address
     from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS accesses.

`tls_le_lo16'
     This modifier is used to load the low 16 bits of the offset of the
     symbol's address from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS
     accesses.

`tls_le_hi16'
     This modifier is used to load the high 16 bits of the offset of the
     symbol's address from the TCB, to be used for local-exec TLS
     accesses.

`tls_le_ha16'
     This modifier is like `tls_le_hi16', but it adds one to the value
     if `tls_le_lo16' of the input value is negative.

`tls_gd_call'
     This modifier is used to tag an instrution as the "call" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS GD reference of its operand.

`tls_gd_add'
     This modifier is used to tag an instruction as the "add" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS GD reference of its operand.

`tls_ie_load'
     This modifier is used to tag an instruction as the "load" part of a
     calling sequence for a TLS IE reference of its operand.

9.47.1 Options
--------------

The Zilog Z80 and Ascii R800 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.
`-z80'
     Produce code for the Z80 processor. There are additional options to
     request warnings and error messages for undocumented instructions.

`-ignore-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wnud'
     Silently assemble undocumented Z80-instructions that have been
     adopted as documented R800-instructions.

`-ignore-unportable-instructions'
`-Wnup'
     Silently assemble all undocumented Z80-instructions.

`-warn-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wud'
     Issue warnings for undocumented Z80-instructions that work on
     R800, do not assemble other undocumented instructions without
     warning.

`-warn-unportable-instructions'
`-Wup'
     Issue warnings for other undocumented Z80-instructions, do not
     treat any undocumented instructions as errors.

`-forbid-undocumented-instructions'
`-Fud'
     Treat all undocumented z80-instructions as errors.

`-forbid-unportable-instructions'
`-Fup'
     Treat undocumented z80-instructions that do not work on R800 as
     errors.

`-r800'
     Produce code for the R800 processor. The assembler does not support
     undocumented instructions for the R800.  In line with common
     practice, `as' uses Z80 instruction names for the R800 processor,
     as far as they exist.

9.47.2 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the 'Z80 family CPU User Manual' by
Zilog.  In expressions a single `=' may be used as "is equal to"
comparison operator.

   Suffices can be used to indicate the radix of integer constants; `H'
or `h' for hexadecimal, `D' or `d' for decimal, `Q', `O', `q' or `o'
for octal, and `B' for binary.

   The suffix `b' denotes a backreference to local label.

9.47.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

The semicolon `;' is the line comment character;

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The Z80 assembler does not support a line separator character.

   The dollar sign `$' can be used as a prefix for hexadecimal numbers
and as a symbol denoting the current location counter.

   A backslash `\' is an ordinary character for the Z80 assembler.

   The single quote `'' must be followed by a closing quote. If there
is one character in between, it is a character constant, otherwise it is
a string constant.

9.47.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The registers are referred to with the letters assigned to them by
Zilog. In addition `as' recognizes `ixl' and `ixh' as the least and
most significant octet in `ix', and similarly `iyl' and  `iyh' as parts
of `iy'.


File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Case,  Prev: Z80-Regs,  Up: Z80 Syntax

9.47.2.3 Case Sensitivity
.........................

Upper and lower case are equivalent in register names, opcodes,
condition codes  and assembler directives.  The case of letters is
significant in labels and symbol names. The case is also important to
distinguish the suffix `b' for a backward reference to a local label
from the suffix `B' for a number in binary notation.

---------------------

Floating-point numbers are not supported.

9.47.4 Z80 Assembler Directives
-------------------------------

`as' for the Z80 supports some additional directives for compatibility
with other assemblers.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the Z80:

`db EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
`defb EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
     For each STRING the characters are copied to the object file, for
     each other EXPRESSION the value is stored in one byte.  A warning
     is issued in case of an overflow.

`dw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`defw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in two bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in three bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in four bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`ds COUNT[, VALUE]'
`defs COUNT[, VALUE]'
     Fill COUNT bytes in the object file with VALUE, if VALUE is
     omitted it defaults to zero.

`SYMBOL equ EXPRESSION'
`SYMBOL defl EXPRESSION'
     These directives set the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION. If `equ'
     is used, it is an error if SYMBOL is already defined.  Symbols
     defined with `equ' are not protected from redefinition.

`set'
     This is a normal instruction on Z80, and not an assembler
     directive.

`psect NAME'
     A synonym for *Note Section::, no second argument should be given.



File: as.info,  Node: Z80 Opcodes,  Prev: Z80 Directives,  Up: Z80-Dependent

9.47.5 Opcodes
--------------

In line with common practice, Z80 mnemonics are used for both the Z80
and the R800.

   In many instructions it is possible to use one of the half index
registers (`ixl',`ixh',`iyl',`iyh') in stead of an 8-bit general
purpose register. This yields instructions that are documented on the
R800 and undocumented on the Z80.  Similarly `in f,(c)' is documented
on the R800 and undocumented on the Z80.

   The assembler also supports the following undocumented
Z80-instructions, that have not been adopted in the R800 instruction
set:
`out (c),0'
     Sends zero to the port pointed to by register c.

`sli M'
     Equivalent to `M = (M<<1)+1', the operand M can be any operand
     that is valid for `sla'. One can use `sll' as a synonym for `sli'.

`OP (ix+D), R'
     This is equivalent to

          ld R, (ix+D)
          OPC R
          ld (ix+D), R

     The operation `OPC' may be any of `res B,', `set B,', `rl', `rlc',
     `rr', `rrc', `sla', `sli', `sra' and `srl', and the register `R'
     may be any of `a', `b', `c', `d', `e', `h' and `l'.

`OPC (iy+D), R'
     As above, but with `iy' instead of `ix'.

   The web site at `http://www.z80.info' is a good starting place to
find more information on programming the Z80.

9.48 Z8000 Dependent Features
=============================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

9.48.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`!' is the line comment character.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

9.48.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The Z8000 has sixteen 16 bit registers, numbered 0 to 15.  You can refer
to different sized groups of registers by register number, with the
prefix `r' for 16 bit registers, `rr' for 32 bit registers and `rq' for
64 bit registers.  You can also refer to the contents of the first
eight (of the sixteen 16 bit registers) by bytes.  They are named `rlN'
and `rhN'.

_byte registers_
     rl0 rh0 rl1 rh1 rl2 rh2 rl3 rh3
     rl4 rh4 rl5 rh5 rl6 rh6 rl7 rh7

_word registers_
     r0 r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 r9 r10 r11 r12 r13 r14 r15

9.48.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rlN'
`rhN'
`rN'
`rrN'
`rqN'
     Register direct:  8bit, 16bit, 32bit, and 64bit registers.

`@rN'
`@rrN'
     Indirect register:  @rrN in segmented mode, @rN in unsegmented
     mode.

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
`rrN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
`rrN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN or rrN is added to the
     sign extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final
     address in memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

9.48.3 Assembler Directives for the Z8000
-----------------------------------------

The Z8000 port of as includes additional assembler directives, for
compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  These do not begin with `.'
(unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
`.z8001'
     Generate code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
`.z8002'
     Generate code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'
          61696420
          22697427
          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

9.49.1 VAX Command-Line Options
-------------------------------

The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives a
warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

`-h N'
     External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are
     not case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.
     This is contrary to the C language definition which explicitly
     distinguishes upper and lower case.  To implement a standard
     conforming C compiler, names must be changed (mapped) to preserve
     the case information.  The default mapping is to convert all lower
     case characters to uppercase and adding an underscore followed by
     a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24 digit binary value.  The
     one digits in the binary value represent which characters are
     uppercase in the original symbol name.

     The `-h N' option determines how we map names.  This takes several
     values.  No `-h' switch at all allows case hacking as described
     above.  A value of zero (`-h0') implies names should be upper
     case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (`-h2') implies
     names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
     (`-h3') implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
     unused.  The `-H' option directs `as' to display every mapped
     symbol during assembly.

     Symbols whose names include a dollar sign `$' are exceptions to the
     general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to
     reference VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to
     upper case.

`-+'
     The `-+' option causes `as' to truncate any symbol name larger
     than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also prevents some code
     following the `_main' symbol normally added to make the object
     file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

`-1'
     This option is ignored for backward compatibility with `as'
     version 1.x.

`-H'
     The `-H' option causes `as' to print every symbol which was
     changed by case mapping.

9.49.2 VAX Floating Point
-------------------------

Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible with
previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (_e.g._ `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.

9.49.3 Vax Machine Directives
-----------------------------

The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.

9.49.4 VAX Opcodes
------------------

All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.


File: as.info,  Node: VAX-branch,  Next: VAX-operands,  Prev: VAX-opcodes,  Up: Vax-Dependent

9.49.5 VAX Branch Improvement
-----------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.

               bar:

`jaobYYY'
     YYY may be one of `lss leq'.

`jsobZZZ'
     ZZZ may be one of `geq gtr'.

9.49.6 VAX Operands
-------------------

The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as DEC
writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

The presence of a `#' appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The `;' character can be used to separate statements on the same

9.50.1 Options
--------------

`as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e1'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E1 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 architecture,
     together with support routines only used by the V850E architecture.

`-mv850e2'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E2 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e2v3'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E2V3 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e2v4'
     This is an alias for `-mv850e3v5'.

`-mv850e3v5'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E3V5 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mrelax'
     Enables relaxation.  This allows the .longcall and .longjump pseudo
     ops to be used in the assembler source code.  These ops label
     sections of code which are either a long function call or a long
     branch.  The assembler will then flag these sections of code and
     the linker will attempt to relax them.

`-mgcc-abi'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting the old GCC ABI.

`-mrh850-abi'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting the RH850 ABI.  This
     is the default.

`-m8byte-align'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting a maximum 64-bits of
     alignment for variables defined in the source code.

`-m4byte-align'
     Marks the generated objecy file as supporting a maximum 32-bits of
     alignment for variables defined in the source code.  This is the
     default.

File: as.info,  Node: V850 Opcodes,  Prev: V850 Directives,  Up: V850-Dependent

9.50.5 Opcodes
--------------

`as' implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`hi0()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then multiplies it by the lower 16 bits in
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addi lo(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds
     the value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the
     expression and stores the result into the immediate operand field
     of the given instruction.  For example the following code can be
     used to compute the address of the label 'here' and store it into
     register 6:

     `movhi hi(here), r0, r6'     `movea lo(here), r6, r6'

     The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
     extension on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address
     of 'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the
     hi() pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6,
     then the movea instruction would takes its immediate operand,
     0xFFFF, sign extend it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it
     into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).
     With the hi() pseudo op adding in the top bit of the lo() pseudo
     op, the movhi instruction actually stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 =
     0x0000), so that the movea instruction stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 -
     the right value.

`hilo()'
     Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which
     must be a mov instruction).  For example:

     `mov hilo(here), r6'

     computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result
     into register 6.

`sdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Small Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP
     register) and stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the
     immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +/- 32K of the address held in the GP register.
     [Note the linker assumes that the GP register contains a fixed
     address set to the address of the label called '__gp'.  This can
     either be set up automatically by the linker, or specifically set
     by using the `--defsym __gp=<value>' command line option].

`tdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Tiny Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP
     register) and stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned
     value in the immediate operand field of the given instruction.
     For example:

     `sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +256 bytes of the address held in the EP
     register.  [Note the linker assumes that the EP register contains
     a fixed address set to the address of the label called '__ep'.
     This can either be set up automatically by the linker, or
     specifically set by using the `--defsym __ep=<value>' command line
     option].

`zdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and
     stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate
     operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6'

     puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6,
     assuming that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of
     memory.  (Strictly speaking it also possible to access the last
     32K of memory as well, as the offsets are signed).

`ctoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Call Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the
     CTBP register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value
     in the immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.
     For example:

     `callt ctoff(table_func1)'

     will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call
     table at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

`.longcall `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     call to function `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this
     call sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the call.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

`.longjump `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     jump to label `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this code
     sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the jump.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

9.51.1 XGATE Options
--------------------

The Freescale XGATE version of `as' has a few machine dependent options.

`-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

`-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

`-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  This is the default.

`-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

`--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the `--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

`--print-opcodes'
     The `--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax. Once the list is printed `as'
     exits.

9.51.2 Syntax
-------------

In XGATE RISC syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by up to three operands. Operands are separated by commas
(`,'). `as' will complain if too many operands are specified for a
given instruction. The same will happen if you specified too few
operands.

     nop
     ldl  #23
     CMP  R1, R2

   The presence of a `;' character or a `!' character anywhere on a
line indicates the start of a comment that extends to the end of that
line.

   A `*' or a `#' character at the start of a line also introduces a
line comment, but these characters do not work elsewhere on the line.
If the first character of the line is a `#' then as well as starting a
comment, the line could also be logical line number directive (*note
Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The XGATE assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

   The following addressing modes are understood for XGATE:
"Inherent"
     `'

"Immediate 3 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER'

"Immediate 4 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER'

"Immediate 8 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER'

"Monadic Addressing"
     `REG'

"Dyadic Addressing"
     `REG, REG'

"Triadic Addressing"
     `REG, REG, REG'

"Relative Addressing 9 Bit Wide"
     `*SYMBOL'

"Relative Addressing 10 Bit Wide"
     `*SYMBOL'

"Index Register plus Immediate Offset"
     `REG, (REG, #NUMBER)'

"Index Register plus Register Offset"
     `REG, REG, REG'

"Index Register plus Register Offset with Post-increment"
     `REG, REG, REG+'

"Index Register plus Register Offset with Pre-decrement"
     `REG, REG, -REG'

     The register can be either `R0', `R1', `R2', `R3', `R4', `R5',
     `R6' or `R7'.


   Convience macro opcodes to deal with 16-bit values have been added.

"Immediate 16 Bit Wide"
     `#NUMBER', or `*SYMBOL'

     For example:

          ldw R1, #1024
          ldw R3, timer
          ldw R1, (R1, #0)
          COM R1
          stw R2, (R1, #0)

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`@lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `add r6, @lo(here - there)'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 6.

`@hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addc r7, @hi(here - there)'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then adds it, along with the carry bit, to the
     value in register 7.

9.53.1 Command Line Options
---------------------------

`--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals'
     Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
     `--no-text-section-literals', which places literals in separate
     sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
     placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With `--text-section-literals', the
     literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep
     them as close as possible to their references.  This may be
     necessary for large assembly files, where the literals would
     otherwise be out of range of the `L32R' instructions in the text
     section.  These options only affect literals referenced via
     PC-relative `L32R' instructions; literals for absolute mode `L32R'
     instructions are handled separately.  *Note literal: Literal
     Directive.

`--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals'
     Indicate to the assembler whether `L32R' instructions use absolute
     or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute
     addressing option, the default is to use absolute `L32R'
     relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative `L32R' relocations
     can be used.

`--target-align | --no-target-align'
     Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties
     at some expense in code size.  *Note Automatic Instruction
     Alignment: Xtensa Automatic Alignment.  This optimization is
     enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always align
     instructions like `LOOP' that have fixed alignment requirements.

`--longcalls | --no-longcalls'
     Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow
     calls across a greater range of addresses.  *Note Function Call
     Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.  This option should be used
     when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade
     both code size and performance, but the linker can generally
     optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within
     range.  The default is `--no-longcalls'.

`--transform | --no-transform'
     Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa
     instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The
     default is `--transform'; `--no-transform' should only be used in
     the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified
     in the assembly source.  Using `--no-transform' causes out of range
     instruction operands to be errors.

`--rename-section OLDNAME=NEWNAME'
     Rename the OLDNAME section to NEWNAME.  This option can be used
     multiple times to rename multiple sections.

`--trampolines | --no-trampolines'
     Enable or disable transformation of jump instructions to allow
     jumps across a greater range of addresses.  *Note Jump
     Trampolines: Xtensa Jump Relaxation.  This option should be used
     when jump targets can potentially be out of range.  In the absence
     of such jumps this option does not affect code size or
     performance.  The default is `--trampolines'.

may be introduced with either `#' or `//'.

   If a `#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be a
logical line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor
control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon (`;').

   FLIX instructions, which bundle multiple opcodes together in a single
instruction, are specified by enclosing the bundled opcodes inside
braces:

     {
     [FORMAT]
     OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]
     ...
     }

   The opcodes in a FLIX instruction are listed in the same order as the
corresponding instruction slots in the TIE format declaration.
Directives and labels are not allowed inside the braces of a FLIX
instruction.  A particular TIE format name can optionally be specified
immediately after the opening brace, but this is usually unnecessary.
The assembler will automatically search for a format that can encode the
specified opcodes, so the format name need only be specified in rare
cases where there is more than one applicable format and where it
matters which of those formats is used.  A FLIX instruction can also be
specified on a single line by separating the opcodes with semicolons:

     { [FORMAT;] OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]; ... }

   If an opcode can only be encoded in a FLIX instruction but is not
specified as part of a FLIX bundle, the assembler will choose the
smallest format where the opcode can be encoded and will fill unused
instruction slots with no-ops.

9.53.2.1 Opcode Names
.....................

See the `Xtensa Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Reference Manual'
for a complete list of opcodes and descriptions of their semantics.

   If an opcode name is prefixed with an underscore character (`_'),
`as' will not transform that instruction in any way.  The underscore
prefix disables both optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa
Optimizations.) and relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa
Relaxation.) for that particular instruction.  Only use the underscore
prefix when it is essential to select the exact opcode produced by the
assembler.  Using this feature unnecessarily makes the code less
efficient by disabling assembler optimization and less flexible by
disabling relaxation.

   Note that this special handling of underscore prefixes only applies
to Xtensa opcodes, not to either built-in macros or user-defined macros.
When an underscore prefix is used with a macro (e.g., `_MOV'), it
refers to a different macro.  The assembler generally provides built-in
macros both with and without the underscore prefix, where the underscore
versions behave as if the underscore carries through to the instructions
in the macros.  For example, `_MOV' may expand to `_MOV.N'.

   The underscore prefix only applies to individual instructions, not to
series of instructions.  For example, if a series of instructions have
underscore prefixes, the assembler will not transform the individual
instructions, but it may insert other instructions between them (e.g.,
to align a `LOOP' instruction).  To prevent the assembler from
modifying a series of instructions as a whole, use the `no-transform'
directive.  *Note transform: Transform Directive.

9.53.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The assembly syntax for a register file entry is the "short" name for a
TIE register file followed by the index into that register file.  For
example, the general-purpose `AR' register file has a short name of
`a', so these registers are named `a0'...`a15'.  As a special feature,
`sp' is also supported as a synonym for `a1'.  Additional registers may
be added by processor configuration options and by designer-defined TIE
extensions.  An initial `$' character is optional in all register names.

9.53.3 Xtensa Optimizations
---------------------------

The optimizations currently supported by `as' are generation of density
instructions where appropriate and automatic branch target alignment.

* Density Instructions::        Using Density Instructions.
* Xtensa Automatic Alignment::  Automatic Instruction Alignment.


File: as.info,  Node: Density Instructions,  Next: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

9.53.3.1 Using Density Instructions
...................................

The Xtensa instruction set has a code density option that provides
16-bit versions of some of the most commonly used opcodes.  Use of these
opcodes can significantly reduce code size.  When possible, the
assembler automatically translates instructions from the core Xtensa
instruction set into equivalent instructions from the Xtensa code
density option.  This translation can be disabled by using underscore
prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), by using the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or by using the `no-transform' directive (*note
transform: Transform Directive.).

   It is a good idea _not_ to use the density instructions directly.
The assembler will automatically select dense instructions where
possible.  If you later need to use an Xtensa processor without the code
density option, the same assembly code will then work without
modification.


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Prev: Density Instructions,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

9.53.3.2 Automatic Instruction Alignment
........................................

The Xtensa assembler will automatically align certain instructions, both
to optimize performance and to satisfy architectural requirements.

   As an optimization to improve performance, the assembler attempts to
align branch targets so they do not cross instruction fetch boundaries.
(Xtensa processors can be configured with either 32-bit or 64-bit
instruction fetch widths.)  An instruction immediately following a call
is treated as a branch target in this context, because it will be the
target of a return from the call.  This alignment has the potential to
reduce branch penalties at some expense in code size.  This
optimization is enabled by default.  You can disable it with the
`--no-target-align' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.).

   The target alignment optimization is done without adding instructions
that could increase the execution time of the program.  If there are
density instructions in the code preceding a target, the assembler can
change the target alignment by widening some of those instructions to
the equivalent 24-bit instructions.  Extra bytes of padding can be
inserted immediately following unconditional jump and return
instructions.  This approach is usually successful in aligning many,
but not all, branch targets.

   The `LOOP' family of instructions must be aligned such that the
first instruction in the loop body does not cross an instruction fetch
boundary (e.g., with a 32-bit fetch width, a `LOOP' instruction must be
on either a 1 or 2 mod 4 byte boundary).  The assembler knows about
this restriction and inserts the minimal number of 2 or 3 byte no-op
instructions to satisfy it.  When no-op instructions are added, any
label immediately preceding the original loop will be moved in order to
refer to the loop instruction, not the newly generated no-op
instruction.  To preserve binary compatibility across processors with
different fetch widths, the assembler conservatively assumes a 32-bit
fetch width when aligning `LOOP' instructions (except if the first
instruction in the loop is a 64-bit instruction).

   Previous versions of the assembler automatically aligned `ENTRY'
instructions to 4-byte boundaries, but that alignment is now the
programmer's responsibility.

9.53.4 Xtensa Relaxation
------------------------

When an instruction operand is outside the range allowed for that
particular instruction field, `as' can transform the code to use a
functionally-equivalent instruction or sequence of instructions.  This
process is known as "relaxation".  This is typically done for branch
instructions because the distance of the branch targets is not known
until assembly-time.  The Xtensa assembler offers branch relaxation and
also extends this concept to function calls, `MOVI' instructions and
other instructions with immediate fields.

* Menu:

* Xtensa Branch Relaxation::        Relaxation of Branches.
* Xtensa Call Relaxation::          Relaxation of Function Calls.
* Xtensa Jump Relaxation::          Relaxation of Jumps.
* Xtensa Immediate Relaxation::     Relaxation of other Immediate Fields.

9.53.4.1 Conditional Branch Relaxation
......................................

When the target of a branch is too far away from the branch itself,
i.e., when the offset from the branch to the target is too large to fit
in the immediate field of the branch instruction, it may be necessary to
replace the branch with a branch around a jump.  For example,

         beqz    a2, L

   may result in:

         bnez.n  a2, M
         j L
     M:

   (The `BNEZ.N' instruction would be used in this example only if the
density option is available.  Otherwise, `BNEZ' would be used.)

   This relaxation works well because the unconditional jump instruction
has a much larger offset range than the various conditional branches.
However, an error will occur if a branch target is beyond the range of a
jump instruction.  `as' cannot relax unconditional jumps.  Similarly,
an error will occur if the original input contains an unconditional
jump to a target that is out of range.

   Branch relaxation is enabled by default.  It can be disabled by using
underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive (*note transform:
Transform Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Next: Xtensa Jump Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Branch Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

9.53.4.2 Function Call Relaxation
.................................

Function calls may require relaxation because the Xtensa immediate call
instructions (`CALL0', `CALL4', `CALL8' and `CALL12') provide a
PC-relative offset of only 512 Kbytes in either direction.  For larger
programs, it may be necessary to use indirect calls (`CALLX0',
`CALLX4', `CALLX8' and `CALLX12') where the target address is specified
in a register.  The Xtensa assembler can automatically relax immediate
call instructions into indirect call instructions.  This relaxation is
done by loading the address of the called function into the callee's
return address register and then using a `CALLX' instruction.  So, for
example:

         call8 func

   might be relaxed to:

         .literal .L1, func
         l32r    a8, .L1
         callx8  a8

   Because the addresses of targets of function calls are not generally
known until link-time, the assembler must assume the worst and relax all
the calls to functions in other source files, not just those that really
will be out of range.  The linker can recognize calls that were
unnecessarily relaxed, and it will remove the overhead introduced by the
assembler for those cases where direct calls are sufficient.

   Call relaxation is disabled by default because it can have a negative
effect on both code size and performance, although the linker can
usually eliminate the unnecessary overhead.  If a program is too large
and some of the calls are out of range, function call relaxation can be
enabled using the `--longcalls' command-line option or the `longcalls'
directive (*note longcalls: Longcalls Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Jump Relaxation,  Next: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

9.53.4.3 Jump Relaxation
........................

Jump instruction may require relaxation because the Xtensa jump
instruction (`J') provide a PC-relative offset of only 128 Kbytes in
either direction.  One option is to use jump long (`J.L') instruction,
which depending on jump distance may be assembled as jump (`J') or
indirect jump (`JX').  However it needs a free register.  When there's
no spare register it is possible to plant intermediate jump sites
(trampolines) between the jump instruction and its target.  These sites
may be located in areas unreachable by normal code execution flow, in
that case they only contain intermediate jumps, or they may be inserted
in the middle of code block, in which case there's an additional jump
from the beginning of the trampoline to the instruction past its end.
So, for example:

         j 1f
         ...
         retw
         ...
         mov a10, a2
         call8 func
         ...
     1:
         ...

   might be relaxed to:

         j .L0_TR_1
         ...
         retw
     .L0_TR_1:
         j 1f
         ...
         mov a10, a2
         call8 func
         ...
     1:
         ...

   or to:

         j .L0_TR_1
         ...
         retw
         ...
         mov a10, a2
         j .L0_TR_0
     .L0_TR_1:
         j 1f
     .L0_TR_0:
         call8 func
         ...
     1:
         ...

   The Xtensa assempler uses trampolines with jump around only when it
cannot find suitable unreachable trampoline.  There may be multiple
trampolines between the jump instruction and its target.

   This relaxation does not apply to jumps to undefined symbols,
assuming they will reach their targets once resolved.

   Jump relaxation is enabled by default because it does not affect
code size or performance while the code itself is small.  This
relaxation may be disabled completely with `--no-trampolines' or
`--no-transform' command-line options (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Jump Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

9.53.4.4 Other Immediate Field Relaxation
.........................................

The assembler normally performs the following other relaxations.  They
can be disabled by using underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names:
Xtensa Opcodes.), the `--no-transform' command-line option (*note
Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive
(*note transform: Transform Directive.).

   The `MOVI' machine instruction can only materialize values in the
range from -2048 to 2047.  Values outside this range are best
materialized with `L32R' instructions.  Thus:

         movi a0, 100000

   is assembled into the following machine code:

         .literal .L1, 100000
         l32r a0, .L1

   The `L8UI' machine instruction can only be used with immediate
offsets in the range from 0 to 255. The `L16SI' and `L16UI' machine
instructions can only be used with offsets from 0 to 510.  The `L32I'
machine instruction can only be used with offsets from 0 to 1020.  A
load offset outside these ranges can be materialized with an `L32R'
instruction if the destination register of the load is different than
the source address register.  For example:

         l32i a1, a0, 2040

   is translated to:

         .literal .L1, 2040
         l32r a1, .L1
         add a1, a0, a1
         l32i a1, a1, 0

If the load destination and source address register are the same, an
out-of-range offset causes an error.

   The Xtensa `ADDI' instruction only allows immediate operands in the
range from -128 to 127.  There are a number of alternate instruction
sequences for the `ADDI' operation.  First, if the immediate is 0, the
`ADDI' will be turned into a `MOV.N' instruction (or the equivalent
`OR' instruction if the code density option is not available).  If the
`ADDI' immediate is outside of the range -128 to 127, but inside the
range -32896 to 32639, an `ADDMI' instruction or `ADDMI'/`ADDI'
sequence will be used.  Finally, if the immediate is outside of this
range and a free register is available, an `L32R'/`ADD' sequence will
be used with a literal allocated from the literal pool.

   For example:

         addi    a5, a6, 0
         addi    a5, a6, 512
         addi    a5, a6, 513
         addi    a5, a6, 50000

   is assembled into the following:

         .literal .L1, 50000
         mov.n   a5, a6
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addi    a5, a5, 1
         l32r    a5, .L1
         add     a5, a6, a5

9.53.5 Directives
-----------------

The Xtensa assembler supports a region-based directive syntax:

         .begin DIRECTIVE [OPTIONS]
         ...
         .end DIRECTIVE

   All the Xtensa-specific directives that apply to a region of code use
this syntax.

   The directive applies to code between the `.begin' and the `.end'.
The state of the option after the `.end' reverts to what it was before
the `.begin'.  A nested `.begin'/`.end' region can further change the
state of the directive without having to be aware of its outer state.
For example, consider:

         .begin no-transform
     L:  add a0, a1, a2
         .begin transform
     M:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end transform
     N:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end no-transform

   The `ADD' opcodes at `L' and `N' in the outer `no-transform' region
both result in `ADD' machine instructions, but the assembler selects an
`ADD.N' instruction for the `ADD' at `M' in the inner `transform'
region.

   The advantage of this style is that it works well inside macros
which can preserve the context of their callers.

   The following directives are available:

* Menu:

* Schedule Directive::         Enable instruction scheduling.
* Longcalls Directive::        Use Indirect Calls for Greater Range.
* Transform Directive::        Disable All Assembler Transformations.
* Literal Directive::          Intermix Literals with Instructions.
* Literal Position Directive:: Specify Inline Literal Pool Locations.
* Literal Prefix Directive::   Specify Literal Section Name Prefix.
* Absolute Literals Directive:: Control PC-Relative vs. Absolute Literals.

The `schedule' directive is recognized only for compatibility with

The `longcalls' directive enables or disables function call relaxation.
*Note Function Call Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.

         .begin [no-]longcalls
         .end [no-]longcalls

   Call relaxation is disabled by default unless the `--longcalls'
command-line option is specified.  The `longcalls' directive overrides
the default determined by the command-line options.

including relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa Relaxation.) and
optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa Optimizations.).

         .begin [no-]transform
         .end [no-]transform

   Transformations are enabled by default unless the `--no-transform'
option is used.  The `transform' directive overrides the default
determined by the command-line options.  An underscore opcode prefix,
disabling transformation of that opcode, always takes precedence over
both directives and command-line flags.


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Directive,  Next: Literal Position Directive,  Prev: Transform Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

9.53.5.4 literal
................

The `.literal' directive is used to define literal pool data, i.e.,
read-only 32-bit data accessed via `L32R' instructions.

         .literal LABEL, VALUE[, VALUE...]

   This directive is similar to the standard `.word' directive, except
that the actual location of the literal data is determined by the
assembler and linker, not by the position of the `.literal' directive.
Using this directive gives the assembler freedom to locate the literal
data in the most appropriate place and possibly to combine identical
literals.  For example, the code:

         entry sp, 40
         .literal .L1, sym
         l32r    a4, .L1

   can be used to load a pointer to the symbol `sym' into register
`a4'.  The value of `sym' will not be placed between the `ENTRY' and
`L32R' instructions; instead, the assembler puts the data in a literal
pool.

   Literal pools are placed by default in separate literal sections;
however, when using the `--text-section-literals' option (*note Command
Line Options: Xtensa Options.), the literal pools for PC-relative mode
`L32R' instructions are placed in the current section.(1) These text
section literal pools are created automatically before `ENTRY'
instructions and manually after `.literal_position' directives (*note
literal_position: Literal Position Directive.).  If there are no
preceding `ENTRY' instructions, explicit `.literal_position' directives
must be used to place the text section literal pools; otherwise, `as'
will report an error.

   When literals are placed in separate sections, the literal section
names are derived from the names of the sections where the literals are
defined.  The base literal section names are `.literal' for PC-relative
mode `L32R' instructions and `.lit4' for absolute mode `L32R'
instructions (*note absolute-literals: Absolute Literals Directive.).
These base names are used for literals defined in the default `.text'
section.  For literals defined in other sections or within the scope of
a `literal_prefix' directive (*note literal_prefix: Literal Prefix
Directive.), the following rules determine the literal section name:

  1. If the current section is a member of a section group, the literal
     section name includes the group name as a suffix to the base
     `.literal' or `.lit4' name, with a period to separate the base
     name and group name.  The literal section is also made a member of
     the group.

  2. If the current section name (or `literal_prefix' value) begins with
     "`.gnu.linkonce.KIND.'", the literal section name is formed by
     replacing "`.KIND'" with the base `.literal' or `.lit4' name.  For
     example, for literals defined in a section named
     `.gnu.linkonce.t.func', the literal section will be
     `.gnu.linkonce.literal.func' or `.gnu.linkonce.lit4.func'.

  3. If the current section name (or `literal_prefix' value) ends with
     `.text', the literal section name is formed by replacing that
     suffix with the base `.literal' or `.lit4' name.  For example, for
     literals defined in a section named `.iram0.text', the literal
     section will be `.iram0.literal' or `.iram0.lit4'.

  4. If none of the preceding conditions apply, the literal section
     name is formed by adding the base `.literal' or `.lit4' name as a
     suffix to the current section name (or `literal_prefix' value).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Literals for the `.init' and `.fini' sections are always placed
in separate sections, even when `--text-section-literals' is enabled.

9.53.5.5 literal_position
.........................

When using `--text-section-literals' to place literals inline in the
section being assembled, the `.literal_position' directive can be used
to mark a potential location for a literal pool.

         .literal_position

   The `.literal_position' directive is ignored when the
`--text-section-literals' option is not used or when `L32R'
instructions use the absolute addressing mode.

   The assembler will automatically place text section literal pools
before `ENTRY' instructions, so the `.literal_position' directive is
only needed to specify some other location for a literal pool.  You may
need to add an explicit jump instruction to skip over an inline literal
pool.

   For example, an interrupt vector does not begin with an `ENTRY'
instruction so the assembler will be unable to automatically find a good
place to put a literal pool.  Moreover, the code for the interrupt
vector must be at a specific starting address, so the literal pool
cannot come before the start of the code.  The literal pool for the
vector must be explicitly positioned in the middle of the vector (before
any uses of the literals, due to the negative offsets used by
PC-relative `L32R' instructions).  The `.literal_position' directive
can be used to do this.  In the following code, the literal for `M'
will automatically be aligned correctly and is placed after the
unconditional jump.

         .global M
     code_start:
         j continue
         .literal_position
         .align 4
     continue:

9.53.5.6 literal_prefix
.......................

The `literal_prefix' directive allows you to override the default
literal section names, which are derived from the names of the sections
where the literals are defined.

         .begin literal_prefix [NAME]
         .end literal_prefix

   For literals defined within the delimited region, the literal section
names are derived from the NAME argument instead of the name of the
current section.  The rules used to derive the literal section names do
not change.  *Note literal: Literal Directive.  If the NAME argument is
omitted, the literal sections revert to the defaults.  This directive
has no effect when using the `--text-section-literals' option (*note
Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.).


File: as.info,  Node: Absolute Literals Directive,  Prev: Literal Prefix Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

9.53.5.7 absolute-literals
..........................

The `absolute-literals' and `no-absolute-literals' directives control
the absolute vs. PC-relative mode for `L32R' instructions.  These are
relevant only for Xtensa configurations that include the absolute
addressing option for `L32R' instructions.

         .begin [no-]absolute-literals
         .end [no-]absolute-literals

   These directives do not change the `L32R' mode--they only cause the
assembler to emit the appropriate kind of relocation for `L32R'
instructions and to place the literal values in the appropriate section.
To change the `L32R' mode, the program must write the `LITBASE' special
register.  It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of the
mode and indicate to the assembler which mode is used in each region of
code.

   If the Xtensa configuration includes the absolute `L32R' addressing
option, the default is to assume absolute `L32R' addressing unless the
`--no-absolute-literals' command-line option is specified.  Otherwise,
the default is to assume PC-relative `L32R' addressing.  The
`absolute-literals' directive can then be used to override the default
determined by the command-line options.

10 Reporting Bugs
*****************

Your bug reports play an essential role in making `as' reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of `as' work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of `as'.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

10.1 Have You Found a Bug?
==========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a `as' bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If `as' produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If `as' does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of `as' are welcome in any case.

10.2 How to Report Bugs
=======================

A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained `as' from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for `as'
to `http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is
a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where
that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the
contents of that location would fool the assembler into doing the right
thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete
example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.  You
might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of `as'.  `as' announces it if you start it with the
     `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of `as'.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the `as' source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile `as'--e.g.
     "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the `-S'
     option.  If you are using `gcc', use the options `-v
     --save-temps'; this will save the assembler source in a file with
     an extension of `.s', and also show you exactly how `as' is being
     run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that `as' gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of `as' is out of sync, or you have encountered
     a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your
     copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a
     crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug
     was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to expect a
     crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
     observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the `as' source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
     discuss something in the `as' source, refer to it by context, not
     by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as `as' it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

*******************

If you have contributed to GAS and your name isn't listed here, it is
not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the maintainer
is Nick Clifton (email address `nickc@redhat.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Renesas H8/300 processors (tc-z8k,
tc-h8300), and IEEE 695 object file format (obj-ieee), was written by
Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve also modified the COFF back
end to use BFD for some low-level operations, for use with the H8/300
and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g., `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made GAS able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"
architecture.

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the
various tic* flavors.

   David Heine, Sterling Augustine, Bob Wilson and John Ruttenberg from
Tensilica, Inc. added support for Xtensa processors.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Jon Beniston added support for the Lattice Mico32 architecture.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.

*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

1 Introduction
**************

BFD is a package which allows applications to use the same routines to
operate on object files whatever the object file format.  A new object
file format can be supported simply by creating a new BFD back end and
adding it to the library.

   BFD is split into two parts: the front end, and the back ends (one
for each object file format).
   * The front end of BFD provides the interface to the user.  It
     manages memory and various canonical data structures.  The front
     end also decides which back end to use and when to call back end
     routines.
   * The back ends provide BFD its view of the real world.  Each back
     end provides a set of calls which the BFD front end can use to
     maintain its canonical form.  The back ends also may keep around
     information for their own use, for greater efficiency.

1.1 History
===========

One spur behind BFD was the desire, on the part of the GNU 960 team at
Intel Oregon, for interoperability of applications on their COFF and
b.out file formats.  Cygnus was providing GNU support for the team, and
was contracted to provide the required functionality.

   The name came from a conversation David Wallace was having with
Richard Stallman about the library: RMS said that it would be quite
hard--David said "BFD". Stallman was right, but the name stuck.

   At the same time, Ready Systems wanted much the same thing, but for
different object file formats: IEEE-695, Oasys, Srecords, a.out and 68k
coff.

   BFD was first implemented by members of Cygnus Support; Steve
Chamberlain ('sac@cygnus.com'), John Gilmore ('gnu@cygnus.com'), K.
Richard Pixley ('rich@cygnus.com') and David Henkel-Wallace
('gumby@cygnus.com').


File: bfd.info,  Node: How It Works,  Next: What BFD Version 2 Can Do,  Prev: History,  Up: Overview

1.2 How To Use BFD
==================

To use the library, include 'bfd.h' and link with 'libbfd.a'.

   BFD provides a common interface to the parts of an object file for a
calling application.

   When an application successfully opens a target file (object,
archive, or whatever), a pointer to an internal structure is returned.
This pointer points to a structure called 'bfd', described in 'bfd.h'.
Our convention is to call this pointer a BFD, and instances of it within
code 'abfd'.  All operations on the target object file are applied as
methods to the BFD. The mapping is defined within 'bfd.h' in a set of
macros, all beginning with 'bfd_' to reduce namespace pollution.

   For example, this sequence does what you would probably expect:
return the number of sections in an object file attached to a BFD
'abfd'.

     #include "bfd.h"

     unsigned int number_of_sections (abfd)
     bfd *abfd;
     {
       return bfd_count_sections (abfd);
     }

   The abstraction used within BFD is that an object file has:

   * a header,
   * a number of sections containing raw data (*note Sections::),
   * a set of relocations (*note Relocations::), and
   * some symbol information (*note Symbols::).
Also, BFDs opened for archives have the additional attribute of an index
and contain subordinate BFDs.  This approach is fine for a.out and coff,
but loses efficiency when applied to formats such as S-records and
IEEE-695.

1.3 What BFD Version 2 Can Do
=============================

When an object file is opened, BFD subroutines automatically determine
the format of the input object file.  They then build a descriptor in
memory with pointers to routines that will be used to access elements of
the object file's data structures.

   As different information from the object files is required, BFD reads
from different sections of the file and processes them.  For example, a
very common operation for the linker is processing symbol tables.  Each
BFD back end provides a routine for converting between the object file's
representation of symbols and an internal canonical format.  When the
linker asks for the symbol table of an object file, it calls through a
memory pointer to the routine from the relevant BFD back end which reads
and converts the table into a canonical form.  The linker then operates
upon the canonical form.  When the link is finished and the linker
writes the output file's symbol table, another BFD back end routine is
called to take the newly created symbol table and convert it into the
chosen output format.

File: bfd.info,  Node: BFD information loss,  Next: Canonical format,  Up: What BFD Version 2 Can Do

1.3.1 Information Loss
----------------------

_Information can be lost during output._  The output formats supported
by BFD do not provide identical facilities, and information which can be
described in one form has nowhere to go in another format.  One example
of this is alignment information in 'b.out'.  There is nowhere in an
'a.out' format file to store alignment information on the contained
data, so when a file is linked from 'b.out' and an 'a.out' image is
produced, alignment information will not propagate to the output file.
(The linker will still use the alignment information internally, so the
link is performed correctly).

   Another example is COFF section names.  COFF files may contain an
unlimited number of sections, each one with a textual section name.  If
the target of the link is a format which does not have many sections
(e.g., 'a.out') or has sections without names (e.g., the Oasys format),
the link cannot be done simply.  You can circumvent this problem by
describing the desired input-to-output section mapping with the linker
command language.

   _Information can be lost during canonicalization._  The BFD internal
canonical form of the external formats is not exhaustive; there are
structures in input formats for which there is no direct representation
internally.  This means that the BFD back ends cannot maintain all
possible data richness through the transformation between external to
internal and back to external formats.

   This limitation is only a problem when an application reads one
format and writes another.  Each BFD back end is responsible for
maintaining as much data as possible, and the internal BFD canonical
form has structures which are opaque to the BFD core, and exported only
to the back ends.  When a file is read in one format, the canonical form
is generated for BFD and the application.  At the same time, the back
end saves away any information which may otherwise be lost.  If the data
is then written back in the same format, the back end routine will be
able to use the canonical form provided by the BFD core as well as the
information it prepared earlier.  Since there is a great deal of
commonality between back ends, there is no information lost when linking
or copying big endian COFF to little endian COFF, or 'a.out' to 'b.out'.
When a mixture of formats is linked, the information is only lost from
the files whose format differs from the destination.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Canonical format,  Prev: BFD information loss,  Up: What BFD Version 2 Can Do

1.3.2 The BFD canonical object-file format
------------------------------------------

The greatest potential for loss of information occurs when there is the
least overlap between the information provided by the source format,
that stored by the canonical format, and that needed by the destination
format.  A brief description of the canonical form may help you
understand which kinds of data you can count on preserving across
conversions.

_files_
     Information stored on a per-file basis includes target machine
     architecture, particular implementation format type, a demand
     pageable bit, and a write protected bit.  Information like Unix
     magic numbers is not stored here--only the magic numbers' meaning,
     so a 'ZMAGIC' file would have both the demand pageable bit and the
     write protected text bit set.  The byte order of the target is
     stored on a per-file basis, so that big- and little-endian object
     files may be used with one another.

_sections_
     Each section in the input file contains the name of the section,
     the section's original address in the object file, size and
     alignment information, various flags, and pointers into other BFD
     data structures.

_symbols_
     Each symbol contains a pointer to the information for the object
     file which originally defined it, its name, its value, and various
     flag bits.  When a BFD back end reads in a symbol table, it
     relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base of the
     section where they were defined.  Doing this ensures that each
     symbol points to its containing section.  Each symbol also has a
     varying amount of hidden private data for the BFD back end.  Since
     the symbol points to the original file, the private data format for
     that symbol is accessible.  'ld' can operate on a collection of
     symbols of wildly different formats without problems.

     Normal global and simple local symbols are maintained on output, so
     an output file (no matter its format) will retain symbols pointing
     to functions and to global, static, and common variables.  Some
     symbol information is not worth retaining; in 'a.out', type
     information is stored in the symbol table as long symbol names.
     This information would be useless to most COFF debuggers; the
     linker has command line switches to allow users to throw it away.

     There is one word of type information within the symbol, so if the
     format supports symbol type information within symbols (for
     example, COFF, IEEE, Oasys) and the type is simple enough to fit
     within one word (nearly everything but aggregates), the information
     will be preserved.

_relocation level_
     Each canonical BFD relocation record contains a pointer to the
     symbol to relocate to, the offset of the data to relocate, the
     section the data is in, and a pointer to a relocation type
     descriptor.  Relocation is performed by passing messages through
     the relocation type descriptor and the symbol pointer.  Therefore,
     relocations can be performed on output data using a relocation
     method that is only available in one of the input formats.  For
     instance, Oasys provides a byte relocation format.  A relocation
     record requesting this relocation type would point indirectly to a
     routine to perform this, so the relocation may be performed on a
     byte being written to a 68k COFF file, even though 68k COFF has no
     such relocation type.

_line numbers_
     Object formats can contain, for debugging purposes, some form of
     mapping between symbols, source line numbers, and addresses in the
     output file.  These addresses have to be relocated along with the
     symbol information.  Each symbol with an associated list of line
     number records points to the first record of the list.  The head of
     a line number list consists of a pointer to the symbol, which
     allows finding out the address of the function whose line number is
     being described.  The rest of the list is made up of pairs: offsets
     into the section and line numbers.  Any format which can simply
     derive this information can pass it successfully between formats
     (COFF, IEEE and Oasys).

2.2 Error reporting
===================

Most BFD functions return nonzero on success (check their individual
documentation for precise semantics).  On an error, they call
'bfd_set_error' to set an error condition that callers can check by
calling 'bfd_get_error'.  If that returns 'bfd_error_system_call', then
check 'errno'.

   The easiest way to report a BFD error to the user is to use
'bfd_perror'.

2.2.1 Type 'bfd_error_type'
---------------------------

The values returned by 'bfd_get_error' are defined by the enumerated
type 'bfd_error_type'.


     typedef enum bfd_error
     {
       bfd_error_no_error = 0,
       bfd_error_system_call,
       bfd_error_invalid_target,
       bfd_error_wrong_format,
       bfd_error_wrong_object_format,
       bfd_error_invalid_operation,
       bfd_error_no_memory,
       bfd_error_no_symbols,
       bfd_error_no_armap,
       bfd_error_no_more_archived_files,
       bfd_error_malformed_archive,
       bfd_error_missing_dso,
       bfd_error_file_not_recognized,
       bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized,
       bfd_error_no_contents,
       bfd_error_nonrepresentable_section,
       bfd_error_no_debug_section,
       bfd_error_bad_value,
       bfd_error_file_truncated,
       bfd_error_file_too_big,
       bfd_error_on_input,
       bfd_error_invalid_error_code
     }
     bfd_error_type;


2.2.1.1 'bfd_get_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_type bfd_get_error (void);
   *Description*
Return the current BFD error condition.

2.2.1.2 'bfd_set_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error (bfd_error_type error_tag, ...);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error condition to be ERROR_TAG.  If ERROR_TAG is
bfd_error_on_input, then this function takes two more parameters, the
input bfd where the error occurred, and the bfd_error_type error.

2.2.1.3 'bfd_errmsg'
....................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_errmsg (bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Return a string describing the error ERROR_TAG, or the system error if
ERROR_TAG is 'bfd_error_system_call'.

2.2.1.4 'bfd_perror'
....................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_perror (const char *message);
   *Description*
Print to the standard error stream a string describing the last BFD
error that occurred, or the last system error if the last BFD error was
a system call failure.  If MESSAGE is non-NULL and non-empty, the error
string printed is preceded by MESSAGE, a colon, and a space.  It is
followed by a newline.

2.2.2 BFD error handler
-----------------------

Some BFD functions want to print messages describing the problem.  They
call a BFD error handler function.  This function may be overridden by
the program.

   The BFD error handler acts like printf.


     typedef void (*bfd_error_handler_type) (const char *, ...);


2.2.2.1 'bfd_set_error_handler'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type bfd_set_error_handler (bfd_error_handler_type);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error handler function.  Returns the previous function.

2.2.2.2 'bfd_set_error_program_name'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error_program_name (const char *);
   *Description*
Set the program name to use when printing a BFD error.  This is printed
before the error message followed by a colon and space.  The string must
not be changed after it is passed to this function.

2.2.2.3 'bfd_get_error_handler'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type bfd_get_error_handler (void);
   *Description*
Return the BFD error handler function.

2.2.3 BFD assert handler
------------------------

If BFD finds an internal inconsistency, the bfd assert handler is called
with information on the BFD version, BFD source file and line.  If this
happens, most programs linked against BFD are expected to want to exit
with an error, or mark the current BFD operation as failed, so it is
recommended to override the default handler, which just calls
_bfd_error_handler and continues.


     typedef void (*bfd_assert_handler_type) (const char *bfd_formatmsg,
                                              const char *bfd_version,
                                              const char *bfd_file,
                                              int bfd_line);


2.2.3.1 'bfd_set_assert_handler'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_assert_handler_type bfd_set_assert_handler (bfd_assert_handler_type);
   *Description*
Set the BFD assert handler function.  Returns the previous function.

2.2.3.2 'bfd_get_assert_handler'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_assert_handler_type bfd_get_assert_handler (void);
   *Description*
Return the BFD assert handler function.

2.3 Miscellaneous
=================

2.3.1 Miscellaneous functions
-----------------------------

2.3.1.1 'bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound (bfd *abfd, asection *sect);
   *Description*
Return the number of bytes required to store the relocation information
associated with section SECT attached to bfd ABFD.  If an error occurs,
return -1.

2.3.1.2 'bfd_canonicalize_reloc'
................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_canonicalize_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **loc, asymbol **syms);
   *Description*
Call the back end associated with the open BFD ABFD and translate the
external form of the relocation information attached to SEC into the
internal canonical form.  Place the table into memory at LOC, which has
been preallocated, usually by a call to 'bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'.
Returns the number of relocs, or -1 on error.

   The SYMS table is also needed for horrible internal magic reasons.

2.3.1.3 'bfd_set_reloc'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **rel, unsigned int count);
   *Description*
Set the relocation pointer and count within section SEC to the values
REL and COUNT.  The argument ABFD is ignored.

2.3.1.4 'bfd_set_file_flags'
............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_file_flags (bfd *abfd, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set the flag word in the BFD ABFD to the value FLAGS.

   Possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_wrong_format' - The target bfd was not of object format.
   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The target bfd was open for
     reading.
   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The flag word contained a bit which
     was not applicable to the type of file.  E.g., an attempt was made
     to set the 'D_PAGED' bit on a BFD format which does not support
     demand paging.

2.3.1.5 'bfd_get_arch_size'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_arch_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Returns the normalized architecture address size, in bits, as determined
by the object file's format.  By normalized, we mean either 32 or 64.
For ELF, this information is included in the header.  Use
bfd_arch_bits_per_address for number of bits in the architecture
address.

   *Returns*
Returns the arch size in bits if known, '-1' otherwise.

2.3.1.6 'bfd_get_sign_extend_vma'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_sign_extend_vma (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Indicates if the target architecture "naturally" sign extends an
address.  Some architectures implicitly sign extend address values when
they are converted to types larger than the size of an address.  For
instance, bfd_get_start_address() will return an address sign extended
to fill a bfd_vma when this is the case.

   *Returns*
Returns '1' if the target architecture is known to sign extend
addresses, '0' if the target architecture is known to not sign extend
addresses, and '-1' otherwise.

2.3.1.7 'bfd_set_start_address'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_start_address (bfd *abfd, bfd_vma vma);
   *Description*
Make VMA the entry point of output BFD ABFD.

   *Returns*
Returns 'TRUE' on success, 'FALSE' otherwise.

2.3.1.8 'bfd_get_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_get_gp_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
under MIPS ECOFF. This is typically set by the '-G' argument to the
compiler, assembler or linker.

2.3.1.9 'bfd_set_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_gp_size (bfd *abfd, unsigned int i);
   *Description*
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
under ECOFF or MIPS ELF. This is typically set by the '-G' argument to
the compiler, assembler or linker.

2.3.1.10 'bfd_scan_vma'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_vma bfd_scan_vma (const char *string, const char **end, int base);
   *Description*
Convert, like 'strtoul', a numerical expression STRING into a 'bfd_vma'
integer, and return that integer.  (Though without as many bells and
whistles as 'strtoul'.)  The expression is assumed to be unsigned (i.e.,
positive).  If given a BASE, it is used as the base for conversion.  A
base of 0 causes the function to interpret the string in hex if a
leading "0x" or "0X" is found, otherwise in octal if a leading zero is
found, otherwise in decimal.

   If the value would overflow, the maximum 'bfd_vma' value is returned.

2.3.1.11 'bfd_copy_private_header_data'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_header_data (bfd *ibfd, bfd *obfd);
   *Description*
Copy private BFD header information from the BFD IBFD to the the BFD
OBFD.  This copies information that may require sections to exist, but
does not require symbol tables.  Return 'true' on success, 'false' on
error.  Possible error returns are:

   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OBFD.
     #define bfd_copy_private_header_data(ibfd, obfd) \
          BFD_SEND (obfd, _bfd_copy_private_header_data, \
                    (ibfd, obfd))

2.3.1.12 'bfd_copy_private_bfd_data'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_bfd_data (bfd *ibfd, bfd *obfd);
   *Description*

is assumed that the instance implements all methods listed below).
     struct bfd_iovec

       /* To avoid problems with macros, a "b" rather than "f"

     long bfd_get_mtime (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file modification time (as read from the file system, or from
the archive header for archive members).

2.3.1.24 'bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     file_ptr bfd_get_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file associated
with BFD ABFD.

   The initial motivation for, and use of, this routine is not so we can
get the exact size of the object the BFD applies to, since that might
not be generally possible (archive members for example).  It would be
ideal if someone could eventually modify it so that such results were
guaranteed.

   Instead, we want to ask questions like "is this NNN byte sized object
I'm about to try read from file offset YYY reasonable?"  As as example
of where we might do this, some object formats use string tables for
which the first 'sizeof (long)' bytes of the table contain the size of
the table itself, including the size bytes.  If an application tries to
read what it thinks is one of these string tables, without some way to
validate the size, and for some reason the size is wrong (byte swapping
error, wrong location for the string table, etc.), the only clue is
likely to be a read error when it tries to read the table, or a "virtual
memory exhausted" error when it tries to allocate 15 bazillon bytes of
space for the 15 bazillon byte table it is about to read.  This function
at least allows us to answer the question, "is the size reasonable?".

2.3.1.25 'bfd_mmap'
...................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_mmap (bfd *abfd, void *addr, bfd_size_type len,
         int prot, int flags, file_ptr offset,
         void **map_addr, bfd_size_type *map_len);
   *Description*
Return mmap()ed region of the file, if possible and implemented.  LEN
and OFFSET do not need to be page aligned.  The page aligned address and
length are written to MAP_ADDR and MAP_LEN.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Memory Usage,  Next: Initialization,  Prev: Miscellaneous,  Up: BFD front end

2.4 Memory Usage
================

BFD keeps all of its internal structures in obstacks.  There is one
obstack per open BFD file, into which the current state is stored.  When
a BFD is closed, the obstack is deleted, and so everything which has
been allocated by BFD for the closing file is thrown away.

   BFD does not free anything created by an application, but pointers
into 'bfd' structures become invalid on a 'bfd_close'; for example,
after a 'bfd_close' the vector passed to 'bfd_canonicalize_symtab' is
still around, since it has been allocated by the application, but the
data that it pointed to are lost.

   The general rule is to not close a BFD until all operations dependent
upon data from the BFD have been completed, or all the data from within
the file has been copied.  To help with the management of memory, there
is a function ('bfd_alloc_size') which returns the number of bytes in
obstacks associated with the supplied BFD. This could be used to select
the greediest open BFD, close it to reclaim the memory, perform some
operation and reopen the BFD again, to get a fresh copy of the data
structures.

2.5 Initialization
==================

2.5.1 Initialization functions
------------------------------

These are the functions that handle initializing a BFD.

2.5.1.1 'bfd_init'
..................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_init (void);
   *Description*
This routine must be called before any other BFD function to initialize
magical internal data structures.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Sections,  Next: Symbols,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: BFD front end

2.6 Sections
============

The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the section
abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of sections.  It keeps
hold of them by pointing to the first; each one points to the next in
the list.

   Sections are supported in BFD in 'section.c'.

* Menu:

* Section Input::
* Section Output::
* typedef asection::
* section prototypes::


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Input,  Next: Section Output,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Sections

2.6.1 Section input
-------------------

When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are created and
attached to the BFD.

   Each section has a name which describes the section in the outside
world--for example, 'a.out' would contain at least three sections,
called '.text', '.data' and '.bss'.

   Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
sections named '.data'.

   Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the "natural" number of
sections.  A back end may attach other sections containing constructor
data, or an application may add a section (using 'bfd_make_section') to
the sections attached to an already open BFD. For example, the linker
creates an extra section 'COMMON' for each input file's BFD to hold
information about common storage.

   The raw data is not necessarily read in when the section descriptor
is created.  Some targets may leave the data in place until a
'bfd_get_section_contents' call is made.  Other back ends may read in
all the data at once.  For example, an S-record file has to be read once
to determine the size of the data.  An IEEE-695 file doesn't contain raw
data in sections, but data and relocation expressions intermixed, so the
data area has to be parsed to get out the data and relocations.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Output,  Next: typedef asection,  Prev: Section Input,  Up: Sections

2.6.2 Section output
--------------------

To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be written have
to be created.  They are attached to the BFD in the same way as input
sections; data is written to the sections using
'bfd_set_section_contents'.

   Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler
and linker) must use the 'asection' fields 'output_section' and
'output_offset' to indicate the file sections to which each section must
be written.  (If the section is being created from scratch,
'output_section' should probably point to the section itself and
'output_offset' should probably be zero.)

   The data to be written comes from input sections attached (via
'output_section' pointers) to the output sections.  The output section
structure can be considered a filter for the input section: the output
section determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the
input section determines the offset into the output section of the data
to be written.

   E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long,
containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma 0x100) and
"B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at vma 0x120) the 'asection' structures would
look like:

        section name          "A"
          output_offset   0x00
          size            0x20
          output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
                                  |    vma             0x100
        section name          "B" |    size            0x123
          output_offset   0x20    |
          size            0x103   |
          output_section  --------|

2.6.3 Link orders
-----------------

The data within a section is stored in a "link_order".  These are much
like the fixups in 'gas'.  The link_order abstraction allows a section
to grow and shrink within itself.

   A link_order knows how big it is, and which is the next link_order
and where the raw data for it is; it also points to a list of
relocations which apply to it.

   The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on final
code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as necessary to make it
work without relaxing, and the user can select whether to relax.
Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of time.  The linker runs around the
relocations to see if any are attached to data which can be shrunk, if
so it does it on a link_order by link_order basis.

digit suffix onto the original TEMPLAT.  If COUNT is non-NULL, then it
specifies the first number tried as a suffix to generate a unique name.
The value pointed to by COUNT will be incremented in this case.

2.6.5.7 'bfd_make_section_old_way'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_old_way (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for the BFD ABFD.  An attempt to create a section with
a name which is already in use returns its pointer without changing the
section chain.

   It has the funny name since this is the way it used to be before it
was rewritten....

   Possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     this BFD.
   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.8 'bfd_make_section_anyway_with_flags'

chain of sections for ABFD.  Create a new section even if there is
already a section with that name.  Also set the attributes of the new
section to the value FLAGS.

   Return 'NULL' and set 'bfd_error' on error; possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     ABFD.
   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.9 'bfd_make_section_anyway'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_anyway (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for ABFD.  Create a new section even if there is
already a section with that name.

   Return 'NULL' and set 'bfd_error' on error; possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     ABFD.
   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.10 'bfd_make_section_with_flags'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_with_flags
        (bfd *, const char *name, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Like 'bfd_make_section_anyway', but return 'NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is already
a section named NAME.  Also set the attributes of the new section to the
value FLAGS.  If there is an error, return 'NULL' and set 'bfd_error'.

2.6.5.11 'bfd_make_section'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section (bfd *, const char *name);
   *Description*
Like 'bfd_make_section_anyway', but return 'NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is already
a section named NAME.  If there is an error, return 'NULL' and set
'bfd_error'.

2.6.5.12 'bfd_set_section_flags'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_flags
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set the attributes of the section SEC in the BFD ABFD to the value
FLAGS.  Return 'TRUE' on success, 'FALSE' on error.  Possible error
returns are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The section cannot have one or more
     of the attributes requested.  For example, a .bss section in
     'a.out' may not have the 'SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' field set.

2.6.5.13 'bfd_rename_section'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_rename_section
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, const char *newname);

         void (*func) (bfd *abfd, asection *sect, void *obj),
         void *obj);
   *Description*
Call the provided function FUNC for each section attached to the BFD
ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument.  The function will be called as if by

            func (abfd, the_section, obj);

   This is the preferred method for iterating over sections; an
alternative would be to use a loop:

               asection *p;
               for (p = abfd->sections; p != NULL; p = p->next)
                  func (abfd, p, ...)

2.6.5.15 'bfd_sections_find_if'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_sections_find_if
        (bfd *abfd,
         bfd_boolean (*operation) (bfd *abfd, asection *sect, void *obj),
         void *obj);
   *Description*
Call the provided function OPERATION for each section attached to the
BFD ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument.  The function will be called as if
by

            operation (abfd, the_section, obj);

   It returns the first section for which OPERATION returns true.

2.6.5.16 'bfd_set_section_size'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_size
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, bfd_size_type val);
   *Description*
Set SEC to the size VAL.  If the operation is ok, then 'TRUE' is
returned, else 'FALSE'.

   Possible error returns:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - Writing has started to the BFD, so
     setting the size is invalid.

2.6.5.17 'bfd_set_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, const void *data,
         file_ptr offset, bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
Sets the contents of the section SECTION in BFD ABFD to the data
starting in memory at DATA.  The data is written to the output section
starting at offset OFFSET for COUNT octets.

   Normally 'TRUE' is returned, else 'FALSE'.  Possible error returns
are:

   * 'bfd_error_no_contents' - The output section does not have the
     'SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' attribute, so nothing can be written to it.
   * and some more too
   This routine is front end to the back end function
'_bfd_set_section_contents'.

2.6.5.18 'bfd_get_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_get_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, void *location, file_ptr offset,
         bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
Read data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into memory starting at LOCATION.
The data is read at an offset of OFFSET from the start of the input
section, and is read for COUNT bytes.

   If the contents of a constructor with the 'SEC_CONSTRUCTOR' flag set
are requested or if the section does not have the 'SEC_HAS_CONTENTS'
flag set, then the LOCATION is filled with zeroes.  If no errors occur,
'TRUE' is returned, else 'FALSE'.

2.6.5.19 'bfd_malloc_and_get_section'
.....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_malloc_and_get_section
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, bfd_byte **buf);
   *Description*
Read all data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into a buffer, *BUF, malloc'd by
this function.

2.6.5.20 'bfd_copy_private_section_data'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_copy_private_section_data
        (bfd *ibfd, asection *isec, bfd *obfd, asection *osec);
   *Description*
Copy private section information from ISEC in the BFD IBFD to the
section OSEC in the BFD OBFD.  Return 'TRUE' on success, 'FALSE' on
error.  Possible error returns are:

   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OSEC.
     #define bfd_copy_private_section_data(ibfd, isection, obfd, osection) \
          BFD_SEND (obfd, _bfd_copy_private_section_data, \
                    (ibfd, isection, obfd, osection))

2.6.5.21 'bfd_generic_is_group_section'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_generic_is_group_section (bfd *, const asection *sec);
   *Description*
Returns TRUE if SEC is a member of a group.

2.6.5.22 'bfd_generic_discard_group'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_generic_discard_group (bfd *abfd, asection *group);
   *Description*

2.7 Symbols
===========

BFD tries to maintain as much symbol information as it can when it moves
information from file to file.  BFD passes information to applications
though the 'asymbol' structure.  When the application requests the
symbol table, BFD reads the table in the native form and translates
parts of it into the internal format.  To maintain more than the
information passed to applications, some targets keep some information
"behind the scenes" in a structure only the particular back end knows
about.  For example, the coff back end keeps the original symbol table
structure as well as the canonical structure when a BFD is read in.  On
output, the coff back end can reconstruct the output symbol table so
that no information is lost, even information unique to coff which BFD
doesn't know or understand.  If a coff symbol table were read, but were
written through an a.out back end, all the coff specific information
would be lost.  The symbol table of a BFD is not necessarily read in
until a canonicalize request is made.  Then the BFD back end fills in a
table provided by the application with pointers to the canonical
information.  To output symbols, the application provides BFD with a
table of pointers to pointers to 'asymbol's.  This allows applications
like the linker to output a symbol as it was read, since the "behind the
scenes" information will be still available.

2.7.1 Reading symbols
---------------------

There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD: allocating
storage, and the actual reading process.  This is an excerpt from an
application which reads the symbol table:

              long storage_needed;
              asymbol **symbol_table;
              long number_of_symbols;
              long i;

              storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);

              if (storage_needed < 0)
                FAIL

              if (storage_needed == 0)
                return;

              symbol_table = xmalloc (storage_needed);
                ...
              number_of_symbols =
                 bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table);

              if (number_of_symbols < 0)
                FAIL

              for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++)
                process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);

   All storage for the symbols themselves is in an objalloc connected to
the BFD; it is freed when the BFD is closed.

2.7.2 Writing symbols
---------------------

Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for writing is
closed.  The application attaches a vector of pointers to pointers to
symbols to the BFD being written, and fills in the symbol count.  The
close and cleanup code reads through the table provided and performs all
the necessary operations.  The BFD output code must always be provided
with an "owned" symbol: one which has come from another BFD, or one
which has been created using 'bfd_make_empty_symbol'.  Here is an
example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one element:

            #include "sysdep.h"
            #include "bfd.h"
            int main (void)
            {
              bfd *abfd;
              asymbol *ptrs[2];
              asymbol *new;

              abfd = bfd_openw ("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
              bfd_set_format (abfd, bfd_object);
              new = bfd_make_empty_symbol (abfd);
              new->name = "dummy_symbol";
              new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way (abfd, ".text");
              new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
              new->value = 0x12345;

              ptrs[0] = new;
              ptrs[1] = 0;

              bfd_set_symtab (abfd, ptrs, 1);
              bfd_close (abfd);
              return 0;
            }

            ./makesym
            nm foo
            00012345 A dummy_symbol

   Many formats cannot represent arbitrary symbol information; for
instance, the 'a.out' object format does not allow an arbitrary number
of sections.  A symbol pointing to a section which is not one of
'.text', '.data' or '.bss' cannot be described.

2.7.3 Mini Symbols
------------------

Mini symbols provide read-only access to the symbol table.  They use
less memory space, but require more time to access.  They can be useful
for tools like nm or objdump, which may have to handle symbol tables of
extremely large executables.

   The 'bfd_read_minisymbols' function will read the symbols into memory
in an internal form.  It will return a 'void *' pointer to a block of
memory, a symbol count, and the size of each symbol.  The pointer is
allocated using 'malloc', and should be freed by the caller when it is
no longer needed.

   The function 'bfd_minisymbol_to_symbol' will take a pointer to a
minisymbol, and a pointer to a structure returned by
'bfd_make_empty_symbol', and return a 'asymbol' structure.  The return
value may or may not be the same as the value from
'bfd_make_empty_symbol' which was passed in.


File: bfd.info,  Node: typedef asymbol,  Next: symbol handling functions,  Prev: Mini Symbols,  Up: Symbols

2.7.4 typedef asymbol
---------------------

An 'asymbol' has the form:


     typedef struct bfd_symbol
     {
       /* A pointer to the BFD which owns the symbol. This information
          is necessary so that a back end can work out what additional
          information (invisible to the application writer) is carried
          with the symbol.

          This field is *almost* redundant, since you can use section->owner
          instead, except that some symbols point to the global sections
          bfd_{abs,com,und}_section.  This could be fixed by making
          these globals be per-bfd (or per-target-flavor).  FIXME.  */
       struct bfd *the_bfd; /* Use bfd_asymbol_bfd(sym) to access this field.  */

.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_is_local_label_name (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Return TRUE if a symbol with the name NAME in the BFD ABFD is a compiler
generated local label, else return FALSE. This just checks whether the
name has the form of a local label.
     #define bfd_is_local_label_name(abfd, name) \
       BFD_SEND (abfd, _bfd_is_local_label_name, (abfd, name))


2.7.5.4 'bfd_is_target_special_symbol'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_is_target_special_symbol (bfd *abfd, asymbol *sym);
   *Description*
Return TRUE iff a symbol SYM in the BFD ABFD is something special to the
particular target represented by the BFD. Such symbols should normally
not be mentioned to the user.

...............................

*Description*
Create a new 'asymbol' structure for the BFD ABFD and return a pointer
to it.

   This routine is necessary because each back end has private
information surrounding the 'asymbol'.  Building your own 'asymbol' and
pointing to it will not create the private information, and will cause
problems later on.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Archives,  Next: Formats,  Prev: Symbols,  Up: BFD front end

2.8 Archives
============

*Description*
An archive (or library) is just another BFD. It has a symbol table,
although there's not much a user program will do with it.

   The big difference between an archive BFD and an ordinary BFD is that
the archive doesn't have sections.  Instead it has a chain of BFDs that
are considered its contents.  These BFDs can be manipulated like any
other.  The BFDs contained in an archive opened for reading will all be
opened for reading.  You may put either input or output BFDs into an
archive opened for output; they will be handled correctly when the
archive is closed.

   Use 'bfd_openr_next_archived_file' to step through the contents of an
archive opened for input.  You don't have to read the entire archive if
you don't want to!  Read it until you find what you want.

   A BFD returned by 'bfd_openr_next_archived_file' can be closed
manually with 'bfd_close'.  If you do not close it, then a second
iteration through the members of an archive may return the same BFD. If
you close the archive BFD, then all the member BFDs will automatically
be closed as well.

   Archive contents of output BFDs are chained through the
'archive_next' pointer in a BFD. The first one is findable through the
'archive_head' slot of the archive.  Set it with 'bfd_set_archive_head'
(q.v.).  A given BFD may be in only one open output archive at a time.

   As expected, the BFD archive code is more general than the archive
code of any given environment.  BFD archives may contain files of
different formats (e.g., a.out and coff) and even different
architectures.  You may even place archives recursively into archives!

   This can cause unexpected confusion, since some archive formats are
more expressive than others.  For instance, Intel COFF archives can
preserve long filenames; SunOS a.out archives cannot.  If you move a
file from the first to the second format and back again, the filename
may be truncated.  Likewise, different a.out environments have different
conventions as to how they truncate filenames, whether they preserve
directory names in filenames, etc.  When interoperating with native
tools, be sure your files are homogeneous.

   Beware: most of these formats do not react well to the presence of
spaces in filenames.  We do the best we can, but can't always handle
this case due to restrictions in the format of archives.  Many Unix
utilities are braindead in regards to spaces and such in filenames
anyway, so this shouldn't be much of a restriction.

   Archives are supported in BFD in 'archive.c'.

2.8.1 Archive functions
-----------------------

2.8.1.1 'bfd_get_next_mapent'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     symindex bfd_get_next_mapent
        (bfd *abfd, symindex previous, carsym **sym);
   *Description*
Step through archive ABFD's symbol table (if it has one).  Successively
update SYM with the next symbol's information, returning that symbol's
(internal) index into the symbol table.

   Supply 'BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' as the PREVIOUS entry to get the first
one; returns 'BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' when you've already got the last one.

   A 'carsym' is a canonical archive symbol.  The only user-visible
element is its name, a null-terminated string.

2.8.1.2 'bfd_set_archive_head'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_archive_head (bfd *output, bfd *new_head);
   *Description*
Set the head of the chain of BFDs contained in the archive OUTPUT to
NEW_HEAD.

2.8.1.3 'bfd_openr_next_archived_file'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_next_archived_file (bfd *archive, bfd *previous);
   *Description*
Provided a BFD, ARCHIVE, containing an archive and NULL, open an input
BFD on the first contained element and returns that.  Subsequent calls
should pass the archive and the previous return value to return a
created BFD to the next contained element.  NULL is returned when there
are no more.

2.9 File formats
================

A format is a BFD concept of high level file contents type.  The formats
supported by BFD are:

   * 'bfd_object'
   The BFD may contain data, symbols, relocations and debug info.

   * 'bfd_archive'
   The BFD contains other BFDs and an optional index.

   * 'bfd_core'
   The BFD contains the result of an executable core dump.

2.9.1 File format functions
---------------------------

2.9.1.1 'bfd_check_format'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_check_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
Verify if the file attached to the BFD ABFD is compatible with the
format FORMAT (i.e., one of 'bfd_object', 'bfd_archive' or 'bfd_core').

   If the BFD has been set to a specific target before the call, only
the named target and format combination is checked.  If the target has
not been set, or has been set to 'default', then all the known target
backends is interrogated to determine a match.  If the default target
matches, it is used.  If not, exactly one target must recognize the
file, or an error results.

   The function returns 'TRUE' on success, otherwise 'FALSE' with one of
the following error codes:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - if 'format' is not one of
     'bfd_object', 'bfd_archive' or 'bfd_core'.

   * 'bfd_error_system_call' - if an error occured during a read - even
     some file mismatches can cause bfd_error_system_calls.

   * 'file_not_recognised' - none of the backends recognised the file
     format.

   * 'bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized' - more than one backend
     recognised the file format.

2.9.1.2 'bfd_check_format_matches'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_check_format_matches
        (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format, char ***matching);
   *Description*
Like 'bfd_check_format', except when it returns FALSE with 'bfd_errno'
set to 'bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized'.  In that case, if
MATCHING is not NULL, it will be filled in with a NULL-terminated list
of the names of the formats that matched, allocated with 'malloc'.  Then
the user may choose a format and try again.

   When done with the list that MATCHING points to, the caller should
free it.

2.9.1.3 'bfd_set_format'
........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
This function sets the file format of the BFD ABFD to the format FORMAT.
If the target set in the BFD does not support the format requested, the
format is invalid, or the BFD is not open for writing, then an error
occurs.

2.9.1.4 'bfd_format_string'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_format_string (bfd_format format);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to a const string 'invalid', 'object', 'archive',
'core', or 'unknown', depending upon the value of FORMAT.

2.10 Relocations
================

BFD maintains relocations in much the same way it maintains symbols:
they are left alone until required, then read in en-masse and translated
into an internal form.  A common routine 'bfd_perform_relocation' acts
upon the canonical form to do the fixup.

   Relocations are maintained on a per section basis, while symbols are
maintained on a per BFD basis.

   All that a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create a
'struct reloc_cache_entry' for each relocation in a particular section,
and fill in the right bits of the structures.

          to bfd_perform_relocation will be set.  */

     typedef struct reloc_cache_entry
     {
       /* A pointer into the canonical table of pointers.  */
       struct bfd_symbol **sym_ptr_ptr;

       /* offset in section.  */
       bfd_size_type address;

       /* addend for relocation value.  */
       bfd_vma addend;

       /* Pointer to how to perform the required relocation.  */
       reloc_howto_type *howto;

     }
     arelent;

   *Description*
Here is a description of each of the fields within an 'arelent':

   * 'sym_ptr_ptr'
   The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol associated
with the relocation request.  It is the pointer into the table returned
by the back end's 'canonicalize_symtab' action.  *Note Symbols::.  The
symbol is referenced through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like
the linker can fix up all the symbols of the same name by modifying only
one pointer.  The relocation routine looks in the symbol and uses the
base of the section the symbol is attached to and the value of the
symbol as the initial relocation offset.  If the symbol pointer is zero,
then the section provided is looked up.

   * 'address'
   The 'address' field gives the offset in bytes from the base of the
section data which owns the relocation record to the first byte of
relocatable information.  The actual data relocated will be relative to
this point; for example, a relocation type which modifies the bottom two
bytes of a four byte word would not touch the first byte pointed to in a
big endian world.

   * 'addend'
   The 'addend' is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)  to
the relocation offset.  Its interpretation is dependent upon the howto.
For example, on the 68k the code:

             char foo[];
             main()
                     {
                     return foo[0x12345678];
                     }

   Could be compiled into:

             linkw fp,#-4
             moveb @#12345678,d0
             extbl d0
             unlk fp
             rts

   This could create a reloc pointing to 'foo', but leave the offset in
the data, something like:

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000006 32        _foo

     00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
     00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @#12345678,d0
     0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
     0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
     0000000e 4e75               ; rts

   Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough space in
them to represent the full address range, and pointers have to be loaded
in two parts.  So you'd get something like:

             or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
             ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
             jmp      r1

   This should create two relocs, both pointing to '_foo', and with
0x12340000 in their addend field.  The data would consist of:

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
     00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000

     00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
     00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
     00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1

   The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds it to
the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the value of
'_foo'.  Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around somewhere, to cope
with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

   One further example is the sparc and the a.out format.  The sparc has
a similar problem to the 88k, in that some instructions don't have room
for an entire offset, but on the sparc the parts are created in odd
sized lumps.  The designers of the a.out format chose to not use the
data within the section for storing part of the offset; all the offset
is kept within the reloc.  Anything in the data should be ignored.

             save %sp,-112,%sp
             sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
             ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
             ret
             restore

   Both relocs contain a pointer to 'foo', and the offsets contain junk.

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
     00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678

     00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
     00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
     00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
     0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
     00000010 81e80000     ; restore

   * 'howto'
   The 'howto' field can be imagined as a relocation instruction.  It is
a pointer to a structure which contains information on what to do with
all of the other information in the reloc record and data section.  A
back end would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input - but it
would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

The 'reloc_howto_type' is a structure which contains all the information

2.10.1.3 'The HOWTO Macro'

*Description*
The HOWTO define is horrible and will go away.

2.10.1.4 'bfd_get_reloc_size'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_get_reloc_size (reloc_howto_type *);
   *Description*
For a reloc_howto_type that operates on a fixed number of bytes, this
returns the number of bytes operated on.

2.10.1.5 'arelent_chain'
........................

*Description*
How relocs are tied together in an 'asection':

     {
       arelent relent;
       struct relent_chain *next;
     }

2.10.1.6 'bfd_check_overflow'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_check_overflow
        (enum complain_overflow how,
         unsigned int bitsize,
         unsigned int rightshift,
         unsigned int addrsize,
         bfd_vma relocation);
   *Description*
Perform overflow checking on RELOCATION which has BITSIZE significant
bits and will be shifted right by RIGHTSHIFT bits, on a machine with
addresses containing ADDRSIZE significant bits.  The result is either of
'bfd_reloc_ok' or 'bfd_reloc_overflow'.

2.10.1.7 'bfd_perform_relocation'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_perform_relocation
        (bfd *abfd,
         arelent *reloc_entry,
         void *data,
         asection *input_section,
         bfd *output_bfd,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
If OUTPUT_BFD is supplied to this function, the generated image will be
relocatable; the relocations are copied to the output file after they
have been changed to reflect the new state of the world.  There are two
ways of reflecting the results of partial linkage in an output file: by
modifying the output data in place, and by modifying the relocation
record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and basic coff) have no
way of specifying an addend in the relocation type, so the addend has to
go in the output data.  This is no big deal since in these formats the
output data slot will always be big enough for the addend.  Complex
reloc types with addends were invented to solve just this problem.  The
ERROR_MESSAGE argument is set to an error message if this return
'bfd_reloc_dangerous'.

2.10.1.8 'bfd_install_relocation'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_install_relocation
        (bfd *abfd,
         arelent *reloc_entry,
         void *data, bfd_vma data_start,
         asection *input_section,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
This looks remarkably like 'bfd_perform_relocation', except it does not
expect that the section contents have been filled in.  I.e., it's
suitable for use when creating, rather than applying a relocation.

   For now, this function should be considered reserved for the
assembler.

2.10.2 The howto manager
------------------------

When an application wants to create a relocation, but doesn't know what
the target machine might call it, it can find out by using this bit of
code.

2.10.2.1 'bfd_reloc_code_type'
..............................

*Description*
The insides of a reloc code.  The idea is that, eventually, there will
be one enumerator for every type of relocation we ever do.  Pass one of
these values to 'bfd_reloc_type_lookup', and it'll return a howto
pointer.

   This does mean that the application must determine the correct
enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a random set of
attributes.

   Here are the possible values for 'enum bfd_reloc_code_real':

 -- : BFD_RELOC_64
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32
 -- : BFD_RELOC_26
 -- : BFD_RELOC_24

 -- : BFD_RELOC_24_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_12_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_8_PCREL
     PC-relative relocations.  Sometimes these are relative to the
     address of the relocation itself; sometimes they are relative to
     the start of the section containing the relocation.  It depends on
     the specific target.

     The 24-bit relocation is used in some Intel 960 configurations.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32_SECREL
     Section relative relocations.  Some targets need this for DWARF2.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_32_PCREL_S2
 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2
 -- : BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2
     These PC-relative relocations are stored as word displacements -
     i.e., byte displacements shifted right two bits.  The 30-bit word
     displacement (<<32_PCREL_S2>> - 32 bits, shifted 2) is used on the
     SPARC. (SPARC tools generally refer to this as <<WDISP30>>.)  The
     signed 16-bit displacement is used on the MIPS, and the 23-bit
     displacement is used on the Alpha.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_HI22
 -- : BFD_RELOC_LO10
     High 22 bits and low 10 bits of 32-bit value, placed into lower
     bits of the target word.  These are used on the SPARC.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_GPREL16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_GPREL32
     For systems that allocate a Global Pointer register, these are
     displacements off that register.  These relocation types are
     handled specially, because the value the register will have is
     decided relatively late.

     SPU Relocations.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_HI16
     Alpha ECOFF and ELF relocations.  Some of these treat the symbol or
     "addend" in some special way.  For GPDISP_HI16 ("gpdisp")
     relocations, the symbol is ignored when writing; when reading, it
     will be the absolute section symbol.  The addend is the
     displacement in bytes of the "lda" instruction from the "ldah"
     instruction (which is at the address of this reloc).
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_LO16
     For GPDISP_LO16 ("ignore") relocations, the symbol is handled as
     with GPDISP_HI16 relocs.  The addend is ignored when writing the
     relocations out, and is filled in with the file's GP value on
     reading, for convenience.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP
     The ELF GPDISP relocation is exactly the same as the GPDISP_HI16
     relocation except that there is no accompanying GPDISP_LO16
     relocation.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_ELF_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITUSE
     The Alpha LITERAL/LITUSE relocs are produced by a symbol reference;
     the assembler turns it into a LDQ instruction to load the address
     of the symbol, and then fills in a register in the real
     instruction.

     The LITERAL reloc, at the LDQ instruction, refers to the .lita
     section symbol.  The addend is ignored when writing, but is filled
     in with the file's GP value on reading, for convenience, as with
     the GPDISP_LO16 reloc.

     The ELF_LITERAL reloc is somewhere between 16_GOTOFF and
     GPDISP_LO16.  It should refer to the symbol to be referenced, as
     with 16_GOTOFF, but it generates output not based on the position
     within the .got section, but relative to the GP value chosen for
     the file during the final link stage.

     The LITUSE reloc, on the instruction using the loaded address,
     gives information to the linker that it might be able to use to
     optimize away some literal section references.  The symbol is
     ignored (read as the absolute section symbol), and the "addend"
     indicates the type of instruction using the register: 1 - "memory"
     fmt insn 2 - byte-manipulation (byte offset reg) 3 - jsr (target of
     branch)
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_HINT
     The HINT relocation indicates a value that should be filled into
     the "hint" field of a jmp/jsr/ret instruction, for possible branch-
     prediction logic which may be provided on some processors.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LINKAGE
     The LINKAGE relocation outputs a linkage pair in the object file,
     which is filled by the linker.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_CODEADDR
     The CODEADDR relocation outputs a STO_CA in the object file, which
     is filled by the linker.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_HI16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_LO16
     The GPREL_HI/LO relocations together form a 32-bit offset from the
     GP register.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BRSGP
     Like BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2, except that the source and target must
     share a common GP, and the target address is adjusted for
     STO_ALPHA_STD_GPLOAD.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_NOP
     The NOP relocation outputs a NOP if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BSR
     The BSR relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LDA
     The LDA relocation outputs a LDA if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^16.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BOH
     The BOH relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21, or else a hint.

     ARM 26 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and is
     not stored in the instruction.  The 2nd lowest bit comes from a 1
     bit field in the instruction.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_THUMB_PCREL_BLX
     Thumb 22 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and

 -- : BFD_RELOC_VTABLE_ENTRY
     These two relocations are used by the linker to determine which of
     the entries in a C++ virtual function table are actually used.
     When the -gc-sections option is given, the linker will zero out the
     entries that are not used, so that the code for those functions
     need not be included in the output.

     VTABLE_INHERIT is a zero-space relocation used to describe to the
     linker the inheritance tree of a C++ virtual function table.  The
     relocation's symbol should be the parent class' vtable, and the
     relocation should be located at the child vtable.

     VTABLE_ENTRY is a zero-space relocation that describes the use of a
     virtual function table entry.  The reloc's symbol should refer to
     the table of the class mentioned in the code.  Off of that base, an
     offset describes the entry that is being used.  For Rela hosts,
     this offset is stored in the reloc's addend.  For Rel hosts, we are
     forced to put this offset in the reloc's section offset.

was generated from.

2.11.1.4 'core_file_matches_executable_p'
.........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean core_file_matches_executable_p
        (bfd *core_bfd, bfd *exec_bfd);
   *Description*
Return 'TRUE' if the core file attached to CORE_BFD was generated by a
run of the executable file attached to EXEC_BFD, 'FALSE' otherwise.

2.11.1.5 'generic_core_file_matches_executable_p'
.................................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean generic_core_file_matches_executable_p
        (bfd *core_bfd, bfd *exec_bfd);
   *Description*
Return TRUE if the core file attached to CORE_BFD was generated by a run
of the executable file attached to EXEC_BFD.  The match is based on
executable basenames only.

   Note: When not able to determine the core file failing command or the
executable name, we still return TRUE even though we're not sure that
core file and executable match.  This is to avoid generating a false
warning in situations where we really don't know whether they match or
not.

2.12 Targets
============

*Description*
Each port of BFD to a different machine requires the creation of a
target back end.  All the back end provides to the root part of BFD is a
structure containing pointers to functions which perform certain low
level operations on files.  BFD translates the applications's requests
through a pointer into calls to the back end routines.

   When a file is opened with 'bfd_openr', its format and target are
unknown.  BFD uses various mechanisms to determine how to interpret the
file.  The operations performed are:

   * Create a BFD by calling the internal routine '_bfd_new_bfd', then
     call 'bfd_find_target' with the target string supplied to
     'bfd_openr' and the new BFD pointer.

   * If a null target string was provided to 'bfd_find_target', look up
     the environment variable 'GNUTARGET' and use that as the target
     string.

   * If the target string is still 'NULL', or the target string is
     'default', then use the first item in the target vector as the
     target type, and set 'target_defaulted' in the BFD to cause
     'bfd_check_format' to loop through all the targets.  *Note
     bfd_target::.  *Note Formats::.

   * Otherwise, inspect the elements in the target vector one by one,
     until a match on target name is found.  When found, use it.

   * Otherwise return the error 'bfd_error_invalid_target' to
     'bfd_openr'.

   * 'bfd_openr' attempts to open the file using 'bfd_open_file', and
     returns the BFD.
   Once the BFD has been opened and the target selected, the file format
may be determined.  This is done by calling 'bfd_check_format' on the
BFD with a suggested format.  If 'target_defaulted' has been set, each
possible target type is tried to see if it recognizes the specified
format.  'bfd_check_format' returns 'TRUE' when the caller guesses
right.

* bfd_target::

2.12.1 bfd_target
-----------------

*Description*
This structure contains everything that BFD knows about a target.  It
includes things like its byte order, name, and which routines to call to
do various operations.

   Every BFD points to a target structure with its 'xvec' member.

   The macros below are used to dispatch to functions through the
'bfd_target' vector.  They are used in a number of macros further down
in 'bfd.h', and are also used when calling various routines by hand
inside the BFD implementation.  The ARGLIST argument must be
parenthesized; it contains all the arguments to the called function.

   They make the documentation (more) unpleasant to read, so if someone
wants to fix this and not break the above, please do.
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist)

     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
         ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist) : \
         (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   For operations which index on the BFD format:
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist)

     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND_FMT
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
        (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist) : \
        (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif

   This is the structure which defines the type of BFD this is.  The
'xvec' member of the struct 'bfd' itself points here.  Each module that
implements access to a different target under BFD, defines one of these.

   FIXME, these names should be rationalised with the names of the entry
points which call them.  Too bad we can't have one macro to define them
both!

2.12.1.1 'bfd_set_default_target'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_set_default_target (const char *name);
   *Description*
Set the default target vector to use when recognizing a BFD. This takes
the name of the target, which may be a BFD target name or a
configuration triplet.

2.12.1.2 'bfd_find_target'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_find_target (const char *target_name, bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target named
TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is 'NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable 'GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined, then
choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't 'NULL'.  This
causes 'bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one
that matches the file being read.

2.12.1.3 'bfd_get_target_info'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_get_target_info (const char *target_name,

         bfd_boolean *is_bigendian,
         int *underscoring,
         const char **def_target_arch);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target named
TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is 'NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable 'GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined, then
choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't 'NULL'.  This
causes 'bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one
that matches the file being read.  If IS_BIGENDIAN is not 'NULL', then
set this value to target's endian mode.  True for big-endian, FALSE for
little-endian or for invalid target.  If UNDERSCORING is not 'NULL',
then set this value to target's underscoring mode.  Zero for
none-underscoring, -1 for invalid target, else the value of target
vector's symbol underscoring.  If DEF_TARGET_ARCH is not 'NULL', then
set it to the architecture string specified by the target_name.

2.12.1.4 'bfd_target_list'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const char ** bfd_target_list (void);
   *Description*
Return a freshly malloced NULL-terminated vector of the names of all the
valid BFD targets.  Do not modify the names.

2.12.1.5 'bfd_seach_for_target'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_search_for_target
        (int (*search_func) (const bfd_target *, void *),
         void *);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the first transfer vector in the list of transfer
vectors maintained by BFD that produces a non-zero result when passed to
the function SEARCH_FUNC.  The parameter DATA is passed, unexamined, to
the search function.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Architectures,  Next: Opening and Closing,  Prev: Targets,  Up: BFD front end

2.13 Architectures
==================

BFD keeps one atom in a BFD describing the architecture of the data
attached to the BFD: a pointer to a 'bfd_arch_info_type'.

   Pointers to structures can be requested independently of a BFD so
that an architecture's information can be interrogated without access to
an open BFD.

   The architecture information is provided by each architecture
package.  The set of default architectures is selected by the macro
'SELECT_ARCHITECTURES'.  This is normally set up in the
'config/TARGET.mt' file of your choice.  If the name is not defined,
then all the architectures supported are included.

   When BFD starts up, all the architectures are called with an
initialize method.  It is up to the architecture back end to insert as
many items into the list of architectures as it wants to; generally this
would be one for each machine and one for the default case (an item with
a machine field of 0).

   BFD's idea of an architecture is implemented in 'archures.c'.

2.13.1 bfd_architecture
-----------------------

*Description*
This enum gives the object file's CPU architecture, in a global
sense--i.e., what processor family does it belong to?  Another field
indicates which processor within the family is in use.  The machine
gives a number which distinguishes different versions of the
architecture, containing, for example, 2 and 3 for Intel i960 KA and
i960 KB, and 68020 and 68030 for Motorola 68020 and 68030.

     extern unsigned int bfd_use_reserved_id;

2.14 Opening and closing BFDs
=============================

2.14.1 Functions for opening and closing
----------------------------------------

2.14.1.1 'bfd_fopen'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fopen (const char *filename, const char *target,
         const char *mode, int fd);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME with the target TARGET.  Return a pointer to the
created BFD. If FD is not -1, then 'fdopen' is used to open the file;
otherwise, 'fopen' is used.  MODE is passed directly to 'fopen' or
'fdopen'.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   The new BFD is marked as cacheable iff FD is -1.

   If 'NULL' is returned then an error has occured.  Possible errors are
'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target' or 'system_call'
error.

   On error, FD is always closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.2 'bfd_openr'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME (using 'fopen') with the target TARGET.  Return a
pointer to the created BFD.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   If 'NULL' is returned then an error has occured.  Possible errors are
'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target' or 'system_call'
error.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.3 'bfd_fdopenr'
......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fdopenr (const char *filename, const char *target, int fd);
   *Description*
'bfd_fdopenr' is to 'bfd_fopenr' much like 'fdopen' is to 'fopen'.  It
opens a BFD on a file already described by the FD supplied.

   When the file is later 'bfd_close'd, the file descriptor will be
closed.  If the caller desires that this file descriptor be cached by
BFD (opened as needed, closed as needed to free descriptors for other
opens), with the supplied FD used as an initial file descriptor (but
subject to closure at any time), call bfd_set_cacheable(bfd, 1) on the
returned BFD. The default is to assume no caching; the file descriptor
will remain open until 'bfd_close', and will not be affected by BFD
operations on other files.

   Possible errors are 'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target'
and 'bfd_error_system_call'.

   On error, FD is closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.4 'bfd_openstreamr'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openstreamr (const char * filename, const char * target, void * stream);
   *Description*
Open a BFD for read access on an existing stdio stream.  When the BFD is
passed to 'bfd_close', the stream will be closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.5 'bfd_openr_iovec'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_iovec (const char *filename, const char *target,
         void *(*open_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *open_closure),
         void *open_closure,
         file_ptr (*pread_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream,
         void *buf,
         file_ptr nbytes,
         file_ptr offset),
         int (*close_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream),
         int (*stat_func) (struct bfd *abfd,
         void *stream,
         struct stat *sb));
   *Description*
Create and return a BFD backed by a read-only STREAM.  The STREAM is
created using OPEN_FUNC, accessed using PREAD_FUNC and destroyed using
CLOSE_FUNC.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   Calls OPEN_FUNC (which can call 'bfd_zalloc' and 'bfd_get_filename')
to obtain the read-only stream backing the BFD. OPEN_FUNC either
succeeds returning the non-'NULL' STREAM, or fails returning 'NULL'
(setting 'bfd_error').

   Calls PREAD_FUNC to request NBYTES of data from STREAM starting at
OFFSET (e.g., via a call to 'bfd_read').  PREAD_FUNC either succeeds
returning the number of bytes read (which can be less than NBYTES when
end-of-file), or fails returning -1 (setting 'bfd_error').

   Calls CLOSE_FUNC when the BFD is later closed using 'bfd_close'.
CLOSE_FUNC either succeeds returning 0, or fails returning -1 (setting
'bfd_error').

   Calls STAT_FUNC to fill in a stat structure for bfd_stat,
bfd_get_size, and bfd_get_mtime calls.  STAT_FUNC returns 0 on success,
or returns -1 on failure (setting 'bfd_error').

   If 'bfd_openr_iovec' returns 'NULL' then an error has occurred.
Possible errors are 'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target'
and 'bfd_error_system_call'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.6 'bfd_openw'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openw (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
Create a BFD, associated with file FILENAME, using the file format
TARGET, and return a pointer to it.

   Possible errors are 'bfd_error_system_call', 'bfd_error_no_memory',
'bfd_error_invalid_target'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.7 'bfd_close'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. If the BFD was open for writing, then pending operations
are completed and the file written out and closed.  If the created file
is executable, then 'chmod' is called to mark it as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   The file descriptor associated with the BFD is closed (even if it was
passed in to BFD by 'bfd_fdopenr').

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.8 'bfd_close_all_done'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_close_all_done (bfd *);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. Differs from 'bfd_close' since it does not complete any
pending operations.  This routine would be used if the application had
just used BFD for swapping and didn't want to use any of the writing
code.

   If the created file is executable, then 'chmod' is called to mark it
as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.9 'bfd_create'
.....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_create (const char *filename, bfd *templ);
   *Description*
Create a new BFD in the manner of 'bfd_openw', but without opening a
file.  The new BFD takes the target from the target used by TEMPL.  The
format is always set to 'bfd_object'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.10 'bfd_make_writable'

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_gnu_debuglink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debuglink section.  If this
section is found, it examines the section for the name and checksum of a
'.debug' file containing auxiliary debugging information.  It then
searches the filesystem for this .debug file in some standard locations,
including the directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found returns the
full filename.

   If DIR is NULL, it will search a default path configured into libbfd
at build time.  [XXX this feature is not currently implemented].

   *Returns*
'NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the .debug file, otherwise a

2.15 Implementation details
===========================

2.15.1 Internal functions
-------------------------

*Description*
These routines are used within BFD. They are not intended for export,
but are documented here for completeness.

2.15.1.1 'bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_write_bigendian_4byte_int (bfd *, unsigned int);
   *Description*
Write a 4 byte integer I to the output BFD ABFD, in big endian order
regardless of what else is going on.  This is useful in archives.

2.15.1.2 'bfd_put_size'
.......................

2.15.1.3 'bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Description*
These macros as used for reading and writing raw data in sections; each
access (except for bytes) is vectored through the target format of the
BFD and mangled accordingly.  The mangling performs any necessary endian
translations and removes alignment restrictions.  Note that types
accepted and returned by these macros are identical so they can be
swapped around in macros--for example, 'libaout.h' defines 'GET_WORD' to
either 'bfd_get_32' or 'bfd_get_64'.

   In the put routines, VAL must be a 'bfd_vma'.  If we are on a system
without prototypes, the caller is responsible for making sure that is
true, with a cast if necessary.  We don't cast them in the macro
definitions because that would prevent 'lint' or 'gcc -Wall' from
detecting sins such as passing a pointer.  To detect calling these with
less than a 'bfd_vma', use 'gcc -Wconversion' on a host with 64 bit
'bfd_vma''s.

2.16 File caching
=================

The file caching mechanism is embedded within BFD and allows the
application to open as many BFDs as it wants without regard to the
underlying operating system's file descriptor limit (often as low as 20
open files).  The module in 'cache.c' maintains a least recently used
list of 'bfd_cache_max_open' files, and exports the name
'bfd_cache_lookup', which runs around and makes sure that the required
BFD is open.  If not, then it chooses a file to close, closes it and
opens the one wanted, returning its file handle.

2.16.1 Caching functions
------------------------

2.16.1.1 'bfd_cache_init'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_cache_init (bfd *abfd);

2.16.1.2 'bfd_cache_close'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_cache_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Remove the BFD ABFD from the cache.  If the attached file is open, then
close it too.

   *Returns*
'FALSE' is returned if closing the file fails, 'TRUE' is returned if all
is well.

2.16.1.3 'bfd_cache_close_all'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_boolean bfd_cache_close_all (void);
   *Description*
Remove all BFDs from the cache.  If the attached file is open, then
close it too.

   *Returns*
'FALSE' is returned if closing one of the file fails, 'TRUE' is returned
if all is well.

2.16.1.4 'bfd_open_file'
........................

*Synopsis*
     FILE* bfd_open_file (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Call the OS to open a file for ABFD.  Return the 'FILE *' (possibly
'NULL') that results from this operation.  Set up the BFD so that future
accesses know the file is open.  If the 'FILE *' returned is 'NULL',
then it won't have been put in the cache, so it won't have to be removed
from it.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Linker Functions,  Next: Hash Tables,  Prev: File Caching,  Up: BFD front end

2.17 Linker Functions
=====================

The linker uses three special entry points in the BFD target vector.  It
is not necessary to write special routines for these entry points when
creating a new BFD back end, since generic versions are provided.
However, writing them can speed up linking and make it use significantly
less runtime memory.

   The first routine creates a hash table used by the other routines.
The second routine adds the symbols from an object file to the hash
table.  The third routine takes all the object files and links them
together to create the output file.  These routines are designed so that
the linker proper does not need to know anything about the symbols in
the object files that it is linking.  The linker merely arranges the
sections as directed by the linker script and lets BFD handle the
details of symbols and relocs.

   The second routine and third routines are passed a pointer to a
'struct bfd_link_info' structure (defined in 'bfdlink.h') which holds
information relevant to the link, including the linker hash table (which
was created by the first routine) and a set of callback functions to the
linker proper.

   The generic linker routines are in 'linker.c', and use the header
file 'genlink.h'.  As of this writing, the only back ends which have
implemented versions of these routines are a.out (in 'aoutx.h') and
ECOFF (in 'ecoff.c').  The a.out routines are used as examples
throughout this section.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Creating a Linker Hash Table,  Next: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table,  Prev: Linker Functions,  Up: Linker Functions

2.17.1 Creating a linker hash table
-----------------------------------

The linker routines must create a hash table, which must be derived from
'struct bfd_link_hash_table' described in 'bfdlink.c'.  *Note Hash
Tables::, for information on how to create a derived hash table.  This
entry point is called using the target vector of the linker output file.

   The '_bfd_link_hash_table_create' entry point must allocate and
initialize an instance of the desired hash table.  If the back end does
not require any additional information to be stored with the entries in
the hash table, the entry point may simply create a 'struct
bfd_link_hash_table'.  Most likely, however, some additional information
will be needed.

   For example, with each entry in the hash table the a.out linker keeps
the index the symbol has in the final output file (this index number is
used so that when doing a relocatable link the symbol index used in the
output file can be quickly filled in when copying over a reloc).  The
a.out linker code defines the required structures and functions for a
hash table derived from 'struct bfd_link_hash_table'.  The a.out linker
hash table is created by the function
'NAME(aout,link_hash_table_create)'; it simply allocates space for the
hash table, initializes it, and returns a pointer to it.

   When writing the linker routines for a new back end, you will
generally not know exactly which fields will be required until you have
finished.  You should simply create a new hash table which defines no
additional fields, and then simply add fields as they become necessary.

2.17.2 Adding symbols to the hash table
---------------------------------------

The linker proper will call the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point for
each object file or archive which is to be linked (typically these are
the files named on the command line, but some may also come from the
linker script).  The entry point is responsible for examining the file.
For an object file, BFD must add any relevant symbol information to the
hash table.  For an archive, BFD must determine which elements of the
archive should be used and adding them to the link.

   The a.out version of this entry point is
'NAME(aout,link_add_symbols)'.

* Adding symbols from an archive::


File: bfd.info,  Node: Differing file formats,  Next: Adding symbols from an object file,  Prev: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.17.2.1 Differing file formats
...............................

Normally all the files involved in a link will be of the same format,
but it is also possible to link together different format object files,
and the back end must support that.  The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry
point is called via the target vector of the file to be added.  This has
an important consequence: the function may not assume that the hash
table is the type created by the corresponding
'_bfd_link_hash_table_create' vector.  All the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function can assume about the hash table is that it is derived from
'struct bfd_link_hash_table'.

   Sometimes the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function must store some
information in the hash table entry to be used by the '_bfd_final_link'
function.  In such a case the output bfd xvec must be checked to make
sure that the hash table was created by an object file of the same
format.

   The '_bfd_final_link' routine must be prepared to handle a hash entry
without any extra information added by the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function.  A hash entry without extra information will also occur when
the linker script directs the linker to create a symbol.  Note that,
regardless of how a hash table entry is added, all the fields will be
initialized to some sort of null value by the hash table entry
initialization function.

   See 'ecoff_link_add_externals' for an example of how to check the
output bfd before saving information (in this case, the ECOFF external
symbol debugging information) in a hash table entry.

2.17.2.2 Adding symbols from an object file
...........................................

When the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an object file, it
must add all externally visible symbols in that object file to the hash
table.  The actual work of adding the symbol to the hash table is
normally handled by the function '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.
The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is responsible for reading all the
symbols from the object file and passing the correct information to
'_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.

   The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should not use
'bfd_canonicalize_symtab' to read the symbols.  The point of providing
this routine is to avoid the overhead of converting the symbols into
generic 'asymbol' structures.

   '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' handles the details of combining
common symbols, warning about multiple definitions, and so forth.  It
takes arguments which describe the symbol to add, notably symbol flags,
a section, and an offset.  The symbol flags include such things as
'BSF_WEAK' or 'BSF_INDIRECT'.  The section is a section in the object
file, or something like 'bfd_und_section_ptr' for an undefined symbol or
'bfd_com_section_ptr' for a common symbol.

   If the '_bfd_final_link' routine is also going to need to read the
symbol information, the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should save it
somewhere attached to the object file BFD. However, the information
should only be saved if the 'keep_memory' field of the 'info' argument
is TRUE, so that the '-no-keep-memory' linker switch is effective.

   The a.out function which adds symbols from an object file is
'aout_link_add_object_symbols', and most of the interesting work is in
'aout_link_add_symbols'.  The latter saves pointers to the hash tables
entries created by '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' indexed by symbol
number, so that the '_bfd_final_link' routine does not have to call the
hash table lookup routine to locate the entry.

2.17.2.3 Adding symbols from an archive
.......................................

When the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an archive, it must
look through the symbols defined by the archive and decide which
elements of the archive should be included in the link.  For each such
element it must call the 'add_archive_element' linker callback, and it
must add the symbols from the object file to the linker hash table.
(The callback may in fact indicate that a replacement BFD should be
used, in which case the symbols from that BFD should be added to the
linker hash table instead.)

   In most cases the work of looking through the symbols in the archive
should be done by the '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' function.
This function builds a hash table from the archive symbol table and
looks through the list of undefined symbols to see which elements should
be included.  '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' is passed a
function to call to make the final decision about adding an archive
element to the link and to do the actual work of adding the symbols to
the linker hash table.

   The function passed to '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' must
read the symbols of the archive element and decide whether the archive
element should be included in the link.  If the element is to be
included, the 'add_archive_element' linker callback routine must be
called with the element as an argument, and the element's symbols must
be added to the linker hash table just as though the element had itself
been passed to the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function.  The
'add_archive_element' callback has the option to indicate that it would
like to replace the element archive with a substitute BFD, in which case
it is the symbols of that substitute BFD that must be added to the
linker hash table instead.

   When the a.out '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function receives an archive,
it calls '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' passing
'aout_link_check_archive_element' as the function argument.
'aout_link_check_archive_element' calls 'aout_link_check_ar_symbols'.
If the latter decides to add the element (an element is only added if it
provides a real, non-common, definition for a previously undefined or
common symbol) it calls the 'add_archive_element' callback and then
'aout_link_check_archive_element' calls 'aout_link_add_symbols' to
actually add the symbols to the linker hash table - possibly those of a
substitute BFD, if the 'add_archive_element' callback avails itself of
that option.

   The ECOFF back end is unusual in that it does not normally call
'_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols', because ECOFF archives already
contain a hash table of symbols.  The ECOFF back end searches the
archive itself to avoid the overhead of creating a new hash table.

2.17.3 Performing the final link
--------------------------------

When all the input files have been processed, the linker calls the
'_bfd_final_link' entry point of the output BFD. This routine is
responsible for producing the final output file, which has several
aspects.  It must relocate the contents of the input sections and copy
the data into the output sections.  It must build an output symbol table
including any local symbols from the input files and the global symbols
from the hash table.  When producing relocatable output, it must modify
the input relocs and write them into the output file.  There may also be
object format dependent work to be done.

   The linker will also call the 'write_object_contents' entry point
when the BFD is closed.  The two entry points must work together in
order to produce the correct output file.

   The details of how this works are inevitably dependent upon the
specific object file format.  The a.out '_bfd_final_link' routine is
'NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.17.3.1 Information provided by the linker
...........................................

Before the linker calls the '_bfd_final_link' entry point, it sets up
some data structures for the function to use.

   The 'input_bfds' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure will point to
a list of all the input files included in the link.  These files are
linked through the 'link_next' field of the 'bfd' structure.

   Each section in the output file will have a list of 'link_order'
structures attached to the 'map_head.link_order' field (the 'link_order'
structure is defined in 'bfdlink.h').  These structures describe how to
create the contents of the output section in terms of the contents of
various input sections, fill constants, and, eventually, other types of
information.  They also describe relocs that must be created by the BFD
backend, but do not correspond to any input file; this is used to
support -Ur, which builds constructors while generating a relocatable
object file.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Relocating the section contents,  Next: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Information provided by the linker,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.17.3.2 Relocating the section contents
........................................

The '_bfd_final_link' function should look through the 'link_order'
structures attached to each section of the output file.  Each
'link_order' structure should either be handled specially, or it should
be passed to the function '_bfd_default_link_order' which will do the
right thing ('_bfd_default_link_order' is defined in 'linker.c').

   For efficiency, a 'link_order' of type 'bfd_indirect_link_order'
whose associated section belongs to a BFD of the same format as the
output BFD must be handled specially.  This type of 'link_order'
describes part of an output section in terms of a section belonging to
one of the input files.  The '_bfd_final_link' function should read the
contents of the section and any associated relocs, apply the relocs to
the section contents, and write out the modified section contents.  If
performing a relocatable link, the relocs themselves must also be
modified and written out.

   The functions '_bfd_relocate_contents' and '_bfd_final_link_relocate'
provide some general support for performing the actual relocations,
notably overflow checking.  Their arguments include information about
the symbol the relocation is against and a 'reloc_howto_type' argument
which describes the relocation to perform.  These functions are defined
in 'reloc.c'.

   The a.out function which handles reading, relocating, and writing
section contents is 'aout_link_input_section'.  The actual relocation is
done in 'aout_link_input_section_std' and 'aout_link_input_section_ext'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Relocating the section contents,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.17.3.3 Writing the symbol table
.................................

The '_bfd_final_link' function must gather all the symbols in the input
files and write them out.  It must also write out all the symbols in the
global hash table.  This must be controlled by the 'strip' and 'discard'
fields of the 'bfd_link_info' structure.

   The local symbols of the input files will not have been entered into
the linker hash table.  The '_bfd_final_link' routine must consider each
input file and include the symbols in the output file.  It may be
convenient to do this when looking through the 'link_order' structures,
or it may be done by stepping through the 'input_bfds' list.

   The '_bfd_final_link' routine must also traverse the global hash
table to gather all the externally visible symbols.  It is possible that
most of the externally visible symbols may be written out when
considering the symbols of each input file, but it is still necessary to
traverse the hash table since the linker script may have defined some
symbols that are not in any of the input files.

   The 'strip' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure controls which
symbols are written out.  The possible values are listed in 'bfdlink.h'.
If the value is 'strip_some', then the 'keep_hash' field of the
'bfd_link_info' structure is a hash table of symbols to keep; each
symbol should be looked up in this hash table, and only symbols which
are present should be included in the output file.

   If the 'strip' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure permits local
symbols to be written out, the 'discard' field is used to further
controls which local symbols are included in the output file.  If the
value is 'discard_l', then all local symbols which begin with a certain
prefix are discarded; this is controlled by the
'bfd_is_local_label_name' entry point.

   The a.out backend handles symbols by calling
'aout_link_write_symbols' on each input BFD and then traversing the
global hash table with the function 'aout_link_write_other_symbol'.  It
builds a string table while writing out the symbols, which is written to
the output file at the end of 'NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.18 Hash Tables
================

BFD provides a simple set of hash table functions.  Routines are
provided to initialize a hash table, to free a hash table, to look up a
string in a hash table and optionally create an entry for it, and to
traverse a hash table.  There is currently no routine to delete an
string from a hash table.

   The basic hash table does not permit any data to be stored with a
string.  However, a hash table is designed to present a base class from
which other types of hash tables may be derived.  These derived types
may store additional information with the string.  Hash tables were
implemented in this way, rather than simply providing a data pointer in
a hash table entry, because they were designed for use by the linker
back ends.  The linker may create thousands of hash table entries, and
the overhead of allocating private data and storing and following
pointers becomes noticeable.

   The basic hash table code is in 'hash.c'.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Next: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Prev: Hash Tables,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.1 Creating and freeing a hash table
----------------------------------------

To create a hash table, create an instance of a 'struct bfd_hash_table'
(defined in 'bfd.h') and call 'bfd_hash_table_init' (if you know
approximately how many entries you will need, the function
'bfd_hash_table_init_n', which takes a SIZE argument, may be used).
'bfd_hash_table_init' returns 'FALSE' if some sort of error occurs.

   The function 'bfd_hash_table_init' take as an argument a function to
use to create new entries.  For a basic hash table, use the function
'bfd_hash_newfunc'.  *Note Deriving a New Hash Table Type::, for why you
would want to use a different value for this argument.

   'bfd_hash_table_init' will create an objalloc which will be used to
allocate new entries.  You may allocate memory on this objalloc using
'bfd_hash_allocate'.

   Use 'bfd_hash_table_free' to free up all the memory that has been
allocated for a hash table.  This will not free up the 'struct
bfd_hash_table' itself, which you must provide.

   Use 'bfd_hash_set_default_size' to set the default size of hash table
to use.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Next: Traversing a Hash Table,  Prev: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.2 Looking up or entering a string
--------------------------------------

The function 'bfd_hash_lookup' is used both to look up a string in the
hash table and to create a new entry.

   If the CREATE argument is 'FALSE', 'bfd_hash_lookup' will look up a
string.  If the string is found, it will returns a pointer to a 'struct
bfd_hash_entry'.  If the string is not found in the table
'bfd_hash_lookup' will return 'NULL'.  You should not modify any of the
fields in the returns 'struct bfd_hash_entry'.

   If the CREATE argument is 'TRUE', the string will be entered into the
hash table if it is not already there.  Either way a pointer to a
'struct bfd_hash_entry' will be returned, either to the existing
structure or to a newly created one.  In this case, a 'NULL' return
means that an error occurred.

   If the CREATE argument is 'TRUE', and a new entry is created, the
COPY argument is used to decide whether to copy the string onto the hash
table objalloc or not.  If COPY is passed as 'FALSE', you must be
careful not to deallocate or modify the string as long as the hash table
exists.

2.18.3 Traversing a hash table
------------------------------

The function 'bfd_hash_traverse' may be used to traverse a hash table,
calling a function on each element.  The traversal is done in a random
order.

   'bfd_hash_traverse' takes as arguments a function and a generic 'void
*' pointer.  The function is called with a hash table entry (a 'struct
bfd_hash_entry *') and the generic pointer passed to
'bfd_hash_traverse'.  The function must return a 'boolean' value, which
indicates whether to continue traversing the hash table.  If the
function returns 'FALSE', 'bfd_hash_traverse' will stop the traversal
and return immediately.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Prev: Traversing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.18.4 Deriving a new hash table type
-------------------------------------

Many uses of hash tables want to store additional information which each
entry in the hash table.  Some also find it convenient to store
additional information with the hash table itself.  This may be done
using a derived hash table.

   Since C is not an object oriented language, creating a derived hash
table requires sticking together some boilerplate routines with a few
differences specific to the type of hash table you want to create.

   An example of a derived hash table is the linker hash table.  The
structures for this are defined in 'bfdlink.h'.  The functions are in
'linker.c'.

   You may also derive a hash table from an already derived hash table.
For example, the a.out linker backend code uses a hash table derived
from the linker hash table.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Define the Derived Structures,  Next: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Prev: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.1 Define the derived structures
......................................

You must define a structure for an entry in the hash table, and a
structure for the hash table itself.

   The first field in the structure for an entry in the hash table must
be of the type used for an entry in the hash table you are deriving
from.  If you are deriving from a basic hash table this is 'struct
bfd_hash_entry', which is defined in 'bfd.h'.  The first field in the
structure for the hash table itself must be of the type of the hash
table you are deriving from itself.  If you are deriving from a basic
hash table, this is 'struct bfd_hash_table'.

   For example, the linker hash table defines 'struct
bfd_link_hash_entry' (in 'bfdlink.h').  The first field, 'root', is of
type 'struct bfd_hash_entry'.  Similarly, the first field in 'struct
bfd_link_hash_table', 'table', is of type 'struct bfd_hash_table'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Next: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Define the Derived Structures,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.2 Write the derived creation routine
...........................................

You must write a routine which will create and initialize an entry in
the hash table.  This routine is passed as the function argument to
'bfd_hash_table_init'.

   In order to permit other hash tables to be derived from the hash
table you are creating, this routine must be written in a standard way.

   The first argument to the creation routine is a pointer to a hash
table entry.  This may be 'NULL', in which case the routine should
allocate the right amount of space.  Otherwise the space has already
been allocated by a hash table type derived from this one.

   After allocating space, the creation routine must call the creation
routine of the hash table type it is derived from, passing in a pointer
to the space it just allocated.  This will initialize any fields used by
the base hash table.

   Finally the creation routine must initialize any local fields for the
new hash table type.

   Here is a boilerplate example of a creation routine.  FUNCTION_NAME
is the name of the routine.  ENTRY_TYPE is the type of an entry in the
hash table you are creating.  BASE_NEWFUNC is the name of the creation
routine of the hash table type your hash table is derived from.

     struct bfd_hash_entry *
     FUNCTION_NAME (struct bfd_hash_entry *entry,
                          struct bfd_hash_table *table,
                          const char *string)
     {
       struct ENTRY_TYPE *ret = (ENTRY_TYPE *) entry;

      /* Allocate the structure if it has not already been allocated by a
         derived class.  */
       if (ret == NULL)
         {
           ret = bfd_hash_allocate (table, sizeof (* ret));
           if (ret == NULL)
             return NULL;
         }

      /* Call the allocation method of the base class.  */
       ret = ((ENTRY_TYPE *)
             BASE_NEWFUNC ((struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret, table, string));

      /* Initialize the local fields here.  */

       return (struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret;
     }
   *Description*
The creation routine for the linker hash table, which is in 'linker.c',
looks just like this example.  FUNCTION_NAME is
'_bfd_link_hash_newfunc'.  ENTRY_TYPE is 'struct bfd_link_hash_entry'.
BASE_NEWFUNC is 'bfd_hash_newfunc', the creation routine for a basic
hash table.

   '_bfd_link_hash_newfunc' also initializes the local fields in a
linker hash table entry: 'type', 'written' and 'next'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.18.4.3 Write other derived routines
.....................................

You will want to write other routines for your new hash table, as well.

   You will want an initialization routine which calls the
initialization routine of the hash table you are deriving from and
initializes any other local fields.  For the linker hash table, this is
'_bfd_link_hash_table_init' in 'linker.c'.

   You will want a lookup routine which calls the lookup routine of the
hash table you are deriving from and casts the result.  The linker hash
table uses 'bfd_link_hash_lookup' in 'linker.c' (this actually takes an
additional argument which it uses to decide how to return the looked up
value).

   You may want a traversal routine.  This should just call the
traversal routine of the hash table you are deriving from with
appropriate casts.  The linker hash table uses 'bfd_link_hash_traverse'
in 'linker.c'.

   These routines may simply be defined as macros.  For example, the
a.out backend linker hash table, which is derived from the linker hash
table, uses macros for the lookup and traversal routines.  These are
'aout_link_hash_lookup' and 'aout_link_hash_traverse' in aoutx.h.

File: bfd.info,  Node: aout,  Next: coff,  Prev: What to Put Where,  Up: BFD back ends

3.2 a.out backends
==================

*Description*
BFD supports a number of different flavours of a.out format, though the
major differences are only the sizes of the structures on disk, and the
shape of the relocation information.

   The support is split into a basic support file 'aoutx.h' and other
files which derive functions from the base.  One derivation file is
'aoutf1.h' (for a.out flavour 1), and adds to the basic a.out functions
support for sun3, sun4, 386 and 29k a.out files, to create a target jump
vector for a specific target.

   This information is further split out into more specific files for
each machine, including 'sunos.c' for sun3 and sun4, 'newsos3.c' for the
Sony NEWS, and 'demo64.c' for a demonstration of a 64 bit a.out format.

   The base file 'aoutx.h' defines general mechanisms for reading and
writing records to and from disk and various other methods which BFD
requires.  It is included by 'aout32.c' and 'aout64.c' to form the names
'aout_32_swap_exec_header_in', 'aout_64_swap_exec_header_in', etc.

   As an example, this is what goes on to make the back end for a sun4,
from 'aout32.c':

            #define ARCH_SIZE 32
            #include "aoutx.h"

   Which exports names:

            ...
            aout_32_canonicalize_reloc
            aout_32_find_nearest_line
            aout_32_get_lineno
            aout_32_get_reloc_upper_bound
            ...

   from 'sunos.c':

            #define TARGET_NAME "a.out-sunos-big"
            #define VECNAME    sparc_aout_sunos_be_vec
            #include "aoutf1.h"

   requires all the names from 'aout32.c', and produces the jump vector

            sparc_aout_sunos_be_vec

   The file 'host-aout.c' is a special case.  It is for a large set of
hosts that use "more or less standard" a.out files, and for which
cross-debugging is not interesting.  It uses the standard 32-bit a.out
support routines, but determines the file offsets and addresses of the
text, data, and BSS sections, the machine architecture and machine type,
and the entry point address, in a host-dependent manner.  Once these
values have been determined, generic code is used to handle the object
file.

   When porting it to run on a new system, you must supply:

             HOST_PAGE_SIZE
             HOST_SEGMENT_SIZE
             HOST_MACHINE_ARCH       (optional)
             HOST_MACHINE_MACHINE    (optional)
             HOST_TEXT_START_ADDR
             HOST_STACK_END_ADDR

   in the file '../include/sys/h-XXX.h' (for your host).  These values,
plus the structures and macros defined in 'a.out.h' on your host system,
will produce a BFD target that will access ordinary a.out files on your
host.  To configure a new machine to use 'host-aout.c', specify:

            TDEFAULTS = -DDEFAULT_VECTOR=host_aout_big_vec
            TDEPFILES= host-aout.o trad-core.o

   in the 'config/XXX.mt' file, and modify 'configure.in' to use the
'XXX.mt' file (by setting "'bfd_target=XXX'") when your configuration is
selected.

3.2.1 Relocations
-----------------

*Description*
The file 'aoutx.h' provides for both the _standard_ and _extended_ forms
of a.out relocation records.

   The standard records contain only an address, a symbol index, and a
type field.  The extended records (used on 29ks and sparcs) also have a
full integer for an addend.

3.2.2 Internal entry points
---------------------------

*Description*
'aoutx.h' exports several routines for accessing the contents of an
a.out file, which are gathered and exported in turn by various format
specific files (eg sunos.c).

3.3 coff backends
=================

BFD supports a number of different flavours of coff format.  The major
differences between formats are the sizes and alignments of fields in
structures on disk, and the occasional extra field.

   Coff in all its varieties is implemented with a few common files and
a number of implementation specific files.  For example, The 88k bcs
coff format is implemented in the file 'coff-m88k.c'.  This file
'#include's 'coff/m88k.h' which defines the external structure of the
coff format for the 88k, and 'coff/internal.h' which defines the
internal structure.  'coff-m88k.c' also defines the relocations used by
the 88k format *Note Relocations::.

   The Intel i960 processor version of coff is implemented in
'coff-i960.c'.  This file has the same structure as 'coff-m88k.c',
except that it includes 'coff/i960.h' rather than 'coff-m88k.h'.

3.3.1 Porting to a new version of coff
--------------------------------------

The recommended method is to select from the existing implementations
the version of coff which is most like the one you want to use.  For
example, we'll say that i386 coff is the one you select, and that your
coff flavour is called foo.  Copy 'i386coff.c' to 'foocoff.c', copy
'../include/coff/i386.h' to '../include/coff/foo.h', and add the lines
to 'targets.c' and 'Makefile.in' so that your new back end is used.
Alter the shapes of the structures in '../include/coff/foo.h' so that
they match what you need.  You will probably also have to add '#ifdef's
to the code in 'coff/internal.h' and 'coffcode.h' if your version of
coff is too wild.

   You can verify that your new BFD backend works quite simply by
building 'objdump' from the 'binutils' directory, and making sure that
its version of what's going on and your host system's idea (assuming it
has the pretty standard coff dump utility, usually called 'att-dump' or
just 'dump') are the same.  Then clean up your code, and send what
you've done to Cygnus.  Then your stuff will be in the next release, and
you won't have to keep integrating it.

3.3.2 How the coff backend works
--------------------------------

3.3.2.1 File layout
...................

The Coff backend is split into generic routines that are applicable to
any Coff target and routines that are specific to a particular target.
The target-specific routines are further split into ones which are
basically the same for all Coff targets except that they use the
external symbol format or use different values for certain constants.

   The generic routines are in 'coffgen.c'.  These routines work for any
Coff target.  They use some hooks into the target specific code; the
hooks are in a 'bfd_coff_backend_data' structure, one of which exists
for each target.

   The essentially similar target-specific routines are in 'coffcode.h'.
This header file includes executable C code.  The various Coff targets
first include the appropriate Coff header file, make any special defines
that are needed, and then include 'coffcode.h'.

   Some of the Coff targets then also have additional routines in the
target source file itself.

   For example, 'coff-i960.c' includes 'coff/internal.h' and
'coff/i960.h'.  It then defines a few constants, such as 'I960', and
includes 'coffcode.h'.  Since the i960 has complex relocation types,
'coff-i960.c' also includes some code to manipulate the i960 relocs.
This code is not in 'coffcode.h' because it would not be used by any
other target.

3.3.2.2 Coff long section names
...............................

In the standard Coff object format, section names are limited to the
eight bytes available in the 's_name' field of the 'SCNHDR' section
header structure.  The format requires the field to be NUL-padded, but
not necessarily NUL-terminated, so the longest section names permitted
are a full eight characters.

   The Microsoft PE variants of the Coff object file format add an
extension to support the use of long section names.  This extension is
defined in section 4 of the Microsoft PE/COFF specification (rev 8.1).
If a section name is too long to fit into the section header's 's_name'
field, it is instead placed into the string table, and the 's_name'
field is filled with a slash ("/") followed by the ASCII decimal
representation of the offset of the full name relative to the string
table base.

   Note that this implies that the extension can only be used in object
files, as executables do not contain a string table.  The standard
specifies that long section names from objects emitted into executable
images are to be truncated.

   However, as a GNU extension, BFD can generate executable images that
contain a string table and long section names.  This would appear to be
technically valid, as the standard only says that Coff debugging
information is deprecated, not forbidden, and in practice it works,
although some tools that parse PE files expecting the MS standard format
may become confused; 'PEview' is one known example.

   The functionality is supported in BFD by code implemented under the
control of the macro 'COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES'.  If not defined, the
format does not support long section names in any way.  If defined, it
is used to initialise a flag, '_bfd_coff_long_section_names', and a hook
function pointer, '_bfd_coff_set_long_section_names', in the Coff
backend data structure.  The flag controls the generation of long
section names in output BFDs at runtime; if it is false, as it will be
by default when generating an executable image, long section names are
truncated; if true, the long section names extension is employed.  The
hook points to a function that allows the value of the flag to be
altered at runtime, on formats that support long section names at all;
on other formats it points to a stub that returns an error indication.

   With input BFDs, the flag is set according to whether any long
section names are detected while reading the section headers.  For a
completely new BFD, the flag is set to the default for the target
format.  This information can be used by a client of the BFD library
when deciding what output format to generate, and means that a BFD that
is opened for read and subsequently converted to a writeable BFD and
modified in-place will retain whatever format it had on input.

   If 'COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES' is simply defined (blank), or is defined
to the value "1", then long section names are enabled by default; if it
is defined to the value zero, they are disabled by default (but still
accepted in input BFDs).  The header 'coffcode.h' defines a macro,
'COFF_DEFAULT_LONG_SECTION_NAMES', which is used in the backends to
initialise the backend data structure fields appropriately; see the
comments for further detail.

3.3.2.3 Bit twiddling
.....................

Each flavour of coff supported in BFD has its own header file describing
the external layout of the structures.  There is also an internal
description of the coff layout, in 'coff/internal.h'.  A major function
of the coff backend is swapping the bytes and twiddling the bits to
translate the external form of the structures into the normal internal
form.  This is all performed in the 'bfd_swap'_thing_direction routines.
Some elements are different sizes between different versions of coff; it
is the duty of the coff version specific include file to override the
definitions of various packing routines in 'coffcode.h'.  E.g., the size
of line number entry in coff is sometimes 16 bits, and sometimes 32
bits.  '#define'ing 'PUT_LNSZ_LNNO' and 'GET_LNSZ_LNNO' will select the
correct one.  No doubt, some day someone will find a version of coff
which has a varying field size not catered to at the moment.  To port
BFD, that person will have to add more '#defines'.  Three of the bit
twiddling routines are exported to 'gdb'; 'coff_swap_aux_in',
'coff_swap_sym_in' and 'coff_swap_lineno_in'.  'GDB' reads the symbol
table on its own, but uses BFD to fix things up.  More of the bit
twiddlers are exported for 'gas'; 'coff_swap_aux_out',
'coff_swap_sym_out', 'coff_swap_lineno_out', 'coff_swap_reloc_out',
'coff_swap_filehdr_out', 'coff_swap_aouthdr_out',
'coff_swap_scnhdr_out'.  'Gas' currently keeps track of all the symbol
table and reloc drudgery itself, thereby saving the internal BFD
overhead, but uses BFD to swap things on the way out, making cross ports
much safer.  Doing so also allows BFD (and thus the linker) to use the
same header files as 'gas', which makes one avenue to disaster
disappear.

3.3.2.4 Symbol reading
......................

The simple canonical form for symbols used by BFD is not rich enough to
keep all the information available in a coff symbol table.  The back end
gets around this problem by keeping the original symbol table around,
"behind the scenes".

   When a symbol table is requested (through a call to
'bfd_canonicalize_symtab'), a request gets through to
'coff_get_normalized_symtab'.  This reads the symbol table from the coff
file and swaps all the structures inside into the internal form.  It
also fixes up all the pointers in the table (represented in the file by
offsets from the first symbol in the table) into physical pointers to
elements in the new internal table.  This involves some work since the
meanings of fields change depending upon context: a field that is a
pointer to another structure in the symbol table at one moment may be
the size in bytes of a structure at the next.  Another pass is made over
the table.  All symbols which mark file names ('C_FILE' symbols) are
modified so that the internal string points to the value in the auxent
(the real filename) rather than the normal text associated with the
symbol ('".file"').

   At this time the symbol names are moved around.  Coff stores all
symbols less than nine characters long physically within the symbol
table; longer strings are kept at the end of the file in the string
table.  This pass moves all strings into memory and replaces them with
pointers to the strings.

   The symbol table is massaged once again, this time to create the
canonical table used by the BFD application.  Each symbol is inspected
in turn, and a decision made (using the 'sclass' field) about the
various flags to set in the 'asymbol'.  *Note Symbols::.  The generated
canonical table shares strings with the hidden internal symbol table.

   Any linenumbers are read from the coff file too, and attached to the
symbols which own the functions the linenumbers belong to.

3.3.2.5 Symbol writing
......................

Writing a symbol to a coff file which didn't come from a coff file will
lose any debugging information.  The 'asymbol' structure remembers the
BFD from which the symbol was taken, and on output the back end makes
sure that the same destination target as source target is present.

   When the symbols have come from a coff file then all the debugging
information is preserved.

   Symbol tables are provided for writing to the back end in a vector of
pointers to pointers.  This allows applications like the linker to
accumulate and output large symbol tables without having to do too much
byte copying.

   This function runs through the provided symbol table and patches each
symbol marked as a file place holder ('C_FILE') to point to the next
file place holder in the list.  It also marks each 'offset' field in the
list with the offset from the first symbol of the current symbol.

   Another function of this procedure is to turn the canonical value
form of BFD into the form used by coff.  Internally, BFD expects symbol
values to be offsets from a section base; so a symbol physically at
0x120, but in a section starting at 0x100, would have the value 0x20.
Coff expects symbols to contain their final value, so symbols have their
values changed at this point to reflect their sum with their owning
section.  This transformation uses the 'output_section' field of the
'asymbol''s 'asection' *Note Sections::.

   * 'coff_mangle_symbols'
   This routine runs though the provided symbol table and uses the
offsets generated by the previous pass and the pointers generated when
the symbol table was read in to create the structured hierarchy required
by coff.  It changes each pointer to a symbol into the index into the
symbol table of the asymbol.

   * 'coff_write_symbols'
   This routine runs through the symbol table and patches up the symbols
from their internal form into the coff way, calls the bit twiddlers, and
writes out the table to the file.

         struct internal_syment syment;
       } u;
     } combined_entry_type;


     /* Each canonical asymbol really looks like this: */

     typedef struct coff_symbol_struct
     {
       /* The actual symbol which the rest of BFD works with */
       asymbol symbol;

       /* A pointer to the hidden information for this symbol */
       combined_entry_type *native;

       /* A pointer to the linenumber information for this symbol */

3.3.2.8 Writing relocations
...........................

To write relocations, the back end steps though the canonical relocation
table and create an 'internal_reloc'.  The symbol index to use is
removed from the 'offset' field in the symbol table supplied.  The
address comes directly from the sum of the section base address and the
relocation offset; the type is dug directly from the howto field.  Then
the 'internal_reloc' is swapped into the shape of an 'external_reloc'
and written out to disk.

3.3.2.9 Reading linenumbers
...........................

Creating the linenumber table is done by reading in the entire coff
linenumber table, and creating another table for internal use.

   A coff linenumber table is structured so that each function is marked
as having a line number of 0.  Each line within the function is an
offset from the first line in the function.  The base of the line number
information for the table is stored in the symbol associated with the
function.

   Note: The PE format uses line number 0 for a flag indicating a new
source file.

   The information is copied from the external to the internal table,
and each symbol which marks a function is marked by pointing its...

   How does this work ?

3.3.2.10 Reading relocations
............................

Coff relocations are easily transformed into the internal BFD form
('arelent').

   Reading a coff relocation table is done in the following stages:

   * Read the entire coff relocation table into memory.

   * Process each relocation in turn; first swap it from the external to
     the internal form.

   * Turn the symbol referenced in the relocation's symbol index into a
     pointer into the canonical symbol table.  This table is the same as
     the one returned by a call to 'bfd_canonicalize_symtab'.  The back
     end will call that routine and save the result if a
     canonicalization hasn't been done.

   * The reloc index is turned into a pointer to a howto structure, in a
     back end specific way.  For instance, the 386 and 960 use the
     'r_type' to directly produce an index into a howto table vector;
     the 88k subtracts a number from the 'r_type' field and creates an
     addend field.

3.4 ELF backends
================

BFD support for ELF formats is being worked on.  Currently, the best
supported back ends are for sparc and i386 (running svr4 or Solaris 2).

   Documentation of the internals of the support code still needs to be
written.  The code is changing quickly enough that we haven't bothered
yet.

3.5 mmo backend
===============

The mmo object format is used exclusively together with Professor Donald
E. Knuth's educational 64-bit processor MMIX. The simulator 'mmix' which
is available at <http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/src/index.html> understands this
format.  That package also includes a combined assembler and linker
called 'mmixal'.  The mmo format has no advantages feature-wise compared
to e.g.  ELF. It is a simple non-relocatable object format with no
support for archives or debugging information, except for symbol value
information and line numbers (which is not yet implemented in BFD). See
<http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/> for more information about MMIX. The ELF format
is used for intermediate object files in the BFD implementation.

File: bfd.info,  Node: File layout,  Next: Symbol-table,  Prev: mmo,  Up: mmo

3.5.1 File layout
-----------------

The mmo file contents is not partitioned into named sections as with
e.g. ELF. Memory areas is formed by specifying the location of the data
that follows.  Only the memory area '0x0000...00' to '0x01ff...ff' is
executable, so it is used for code (and constants) and the area
'0x2000...00' to '0x20ff...ff' is used for writable data.  *Note mmo
section mapping::.

   There is provision for specifying "special data" of 65536 different
types.  We use type 80 (decimal), arbitrarily chosen the same as the ELF
'e_machine' number for MMIX, filling it with section information
normally found in ELF objects.  *Note mmo section mapping::.

   Contents is entered as 32-bit words, xor:ed over previous contents,
always zero-initialized.  A word that starts with the byte '0x98' forms
a command called a 'lopcode', where the next byte distinguished between
the thirteen lopcodes.  The two remaining bytes, called the 'Y' and 'Z'
fields, or the 'YZ' field (a 16-bit big-endian number), are used for
various purposes different for each lopcode.  As documented in
<http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/mmixal.pdf>, the lopcodes are:

'lop_quote'
     0x98000001.  The next word is contents, regardless of whether it
     starts with 0x98 or not.

'lop_loc'
     0x9801YYZZ, where 'Z' is 1 or 2.  This is a location directive,
     setting the location for the next data to the next 32-bit word (for
     Z = 1) or 64-bit word (for Z = 2), plus Y * 2^56.  Normally 'Y' is
     0 for the text segment and 2 for the data segment.  Beware that the
     low bits of non- tetrabyte-aligned values are silently discarded
     when being automatically incremented and when storing contents (in
     contrast to e.g.  its use as current location when followed by
     lop_fixo et al before the next possibly-quoted tetrabyte contents).

'lop_skip'
     0x9802YYZZ. Increase the current location by 'YZ' bytes.

'lop_fixo'
     0x9803YYZZ, where 'Z' is 1 or 2.  Store the current location as 64
     bits into the location pointed to by the next 32-bit (Z = 1) or
     64-bit (Z = 2) word, plus Y * 2^56.

'lop_fixr'
     0x9804YYZZ. 'YZ' is stored into the current location plus 2 - 4 *
     YZ.

'lop_fixrx'
     0x980500ZZ. 'Z' is 16 or 24.  A value 'L' derived from the
     following 32-bit word are used in a manner similar to 'YZ' in
     lop_fixr: it is xor:ed into the current location minus 4 * L.  The
     first byte of the word is 0 or 1.  If it is 1, then L = (LOWEST 24
     BITS OF WORD) - 2^Z, if 0, then L = (LOWEST 24 BITS OF WORD).

'lop_file'
     0x9806YYZZ. 'Y' is the file number, 'Z' is count of 32-bit words.
     Set the file number to 'Y' and the line counter to 0.  The next Z *
     4 bytes contain the file name, padded with zeros if the count is
     not a multiple of four.  The same 'Y' may occur multiple times, but
     'Z' must be 0 for all but the first occurrence.

'lop_line'
     0x9807YYZZ. 'YZ' is the line number.  Together with lop_file, it
     forms the source location for the next 32-bit word.  Note that for
     each non-lopcode 32-bit word, line numbers are assumed incremented
     by one.

'lop_spec'
     0x9808YYZZ. 'YZ' is the type number.  Data until the next lopcode
     other than lop_quote forms special data of type 'YZ'.  *Note mmo
     section mapping::.

     Other types than 80, (or type 80 with a content that does not
     parse) is stored in sections named '.MMIX.spec_data.N' where N is
     the 'YZ'-type.  The flags for such a sections say not to allocate
     or load the data.  The vma is 0.  Contents of multiple occurrences
     of special data N is concatenated to the data of the previous
     lop_spec Ns.  The location in data or code at which the lop_spec
     occurred is lost.

'lop_pre'
     0x980901ZZ. The first lopcode in a file.  The 'Z' field forms the
     length of header information in 32-bit words, where the first word
     tells the time in seconds since '00:00:00 GMT Jan 1 1970'.

'lop_post'
     0x980a00ZZ. Z > 32.  This lopcode follows after all
     content-generating lopcodes in a program.  The 'Z' field denotes
     the value of 'rG' at the beginning of the program.  The following
     256 - Z big-endian 64-bit words are loaded into global registers
     '$G' ... '$255'.

'lop_stab'
     0x980b0000.  The next-to-last lopcode in a program.  Must follow
     immediately after the lop_post lopcode and its data.  After this
     lopcode follows all symbols in a compressed format (*note
     Symbol-table::).

'lop_end'
     0x980cYYZZ. The last lopcode in a program.  It must follow the
     lop_stab lopcode and its data.  The 'YZ' field contains the number
     of 32-bit words of symbol table information after the preceding
     lop_stab lopcode.

   Note that the lopcode "fixups"; 'lop_fixr', 'lop_fixrx' and
'lop_fixo' are not generated by BFD, but are handled.  They are
generated by 'mmixal'.

   This trivial one-label, one-instruction file:

      :Main TRAP 1,2,3

   can be represented this way in mmo:

      0x98090101 - lop_pre, one 32-bit word with timestamp.
      <timestamp>
      0x98010002 - lop_loc, text segment, using a 64-bit address.
                   Note that mmixal does not emit this for the file above.
      0x00000000 - Address, high 32 bits.
      0x00000000 - Address, low 32 bits.
      0x98060002 - lop_file, 2 32-bit words for file-name.

      0x2e730000 - ".s\0\0"
      0x98070001 - lop_line, line 1.
      0x00010203 - TRAP 1,2,3
      0x980a00ff - lop_post, setting $255 to 0.
      0x00000000
      0x00000000
      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.

      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00

3.5.2 Symbol table format
-------------------------

From mmixal.w (or really, the generated mmixal.tex) in the MMIXware
package which also contains the 'mmix' simulator: "Symbols are stored
and retrieved by means of a 'ternary search trie', following ideas of
Bentley and Sedgewick.  (See ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms '8'
(1997), 360-369; R.Sedgewick, 'Algorithms in C' (Reading, Mass.
Addison-Wesley, 1998), '15.4'.)  Each trie node stores a character, and
there are branches to subtries for the cases where a given character is
less than, equal to, or greater than the character in the trie.  There
also is a pointer to a symbol table entry if a symbol ends at the
current node."

   So it's a tree encoded as a stream of bytes.  The stream of bytes
acts on a single virtual global symbol, adding and removing characters
and signalling complete symbol points.  Here, we read the stream and
create symbols at the completion points.

   First, there's a control byte 'm'.  If any of the listed bits in 'm'
is nonzero, we execute what stands at the right, in the listed order:

      (MMO3_LEFT)
      0x40 - Traverse left trie.
             (Read a new command byte and recurse.)

      (MMO3_SYMBITS)
      0x2f - Read the next byte as a character and store it in the
             current character position; increment character position.
             Test the bits of m:

             (MMO3_WCHAR)
             0x80 - The character is 16-bit (so read another byte,
                    merge into current character.

             (MMO3_TYPEBITS)
             0xf  - We have a complete symbol; parse the type, value
                    and serial number and do what should be done
                    with a symbol.  The type and length information
                    is in j = (m & 0xf).

                    (MMO3_REGQUAL_BITS)
                    j == 0xf: A register variable.  The following
                              byte tells which register.
                    j <= 8:   An absolute symbol.  Read j bytes as the
                              big-endian number the symbol equals.
                              A j = 2 with two zero bytes denotes an
                              unknown symbol.
                    j > 8:    As with j <= 8, but add (0x20 << 56)
                              to the value in the following j - 8
                              bytes.

                    Then comes the serial number, as a variant of
                    uleb128, but better named ubeb128:
                    Read bytes and shift the previous value left 7
                    (multiply by 128).  Add in the new byte, repeat
                    until a byte has bit 7 set.  The serial number
                    is the computed value minus 128.

             (MMO3_MIDDLE)
             0x20 - Traverse middle trie.  (Read a new command byte
                    and recurse.)  Decrement character position.

      (MMO3_RIGHT)
      0x10 - Traverse right trie.  (Read a new command byte and
             recurse.)

   Let's look again at the 'lop_stab' for the trivial file (*note File
layout::).

      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000

   This forms the trivial trie (note that the path between ":" and "M"
is redundant):

      203a     ":"
      40       /
      40      /
      10      \
      40      /
      40     /
      204d  "M"
      2061  "a"
      2069  "i"
      016e  "n" is the last character in a full symbol, and
            with a value represented in one byte.
      00    The value is 0.
      81    The serial number is 1.

3.5.3 mmo section mapping
-------------------------

The implementation in BFD uses special data type 80 (decimal) to
encapsulate and describe named sections, containing e.g. debug
information.  If needed, any datum in the encapsulation will be quoted
using lop_quote.  First comes a 32-bit word holding the number of 32-bit
words containing the zero-terminated zero-padded segment name.  After
the name there's a 32-bit word holding flags describing the section
type.  Then comes a 64-bit big-endian word with the section length (in
bytes), then another with the section start address.  Depending on the
type of section, the contents might follow, zero-padded to 32-bit
boundary.  For a loadable section (such as data or code), the contents
might follow at some later point, not necessarily immediately, as a
lop_loc with the same start address as in the section description,
followed by the contents.  This in effect forms a descriptor that must
be emitted before the actual contents.  Sections described this way must
not overlap.

   For areas that don't have such descriptors, synthetic sections are
formed by BFD. Consecutive contents in the two memory areas
'0x0000...00' to '0x01ff...ff' and '0x2000...00' to '0x20ff...ff' are
entered in sections named '.text' and '.data' respectively.  If an area
is not otherwise described, but would together with a neighboring lower
area be less than '0x40000000' bytes long, it is joined with the lower
area and the gap is zero-filled.  For other cases, a new section is
formed, named '.MMIX.sec.N'.  Here, N is a number, a running count
through the mmo file, starting at 0.

   A loadable section specified as:

      .section secname,"ax"
      TETRA 1,2,3,4,-1,-2009
      BYTE 80

   and linked to address '0x4', is represented by the sequence:

      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "secn"
      0x616d6500 - "ame\0"
      0x00000033 - flags CODE, READONLY, LOAD, ALLOC
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000001c - section length is 28 bytes; 6 * 4 + 1 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section address
      0x00000004 - section address is 4
      0x98010002 - 64 bits with address of following data
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x00000004 - low 32 bits: data starts at address 4
      0x00000001 - 1
      0x00000002 - 2
      0x00000003 - 3
      0x00000004 - 4
      0xffffffff - -1
      0xfffff827 - -2009
      0x50000000 - 80 as a byte, padded with zeros.

   Note that the lop_spec wrapping does not include the section
contents.  Compare this to a non-loaded section specified as:

      .section thirdsec
      TETRA 200001,100002
      BYTE 38,40

   This, when linked to address '0x200000000000001c', is represented by:

      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "thir"
      0x616d6500 - "dsec"
      0x00000010 - flag READONLY
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000000c - section length is 12 bytes; 2 * 4 + 2 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x20000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x0000001c - low 32 bits of address 0x200000000000001c
      0x00030d41 - 200001
      0x000186a2 - 100002
      0x26280000 - 38, 40 as bytes, padded with zeros

   For the latter example, the section contents must not be loaded in
memory, and is therefore specified as part of the special data.  The
address is usually unimportant but might provide information for e.g.
the DWARF 2 debugging format.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,

     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3

       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

     ar [-]P[MOD] [`--plugin' NAME] [`--target' BFDNAME] [RELPOS] [COUNT] ARCHIVE [MEMBER...]
     ar -M [ <mri-script ]

   The GNU `ar' program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.
An "archive" is a single file holding a collection of other files in a
structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual
files (called "members" of the archive).

   The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner,
and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
extraction.

   GNU `ar' can maintain archives whose members have names of any
length; however, depending on how `ar' is configured on your system, a
limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with
archive formats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the limit
is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16
characters (typical of formats related to coff).

   `ar' is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort
are most often used as "libraries" holding commonly needed subroutines.

   `ar' creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object
modules in the archive when you specify the modifier `s'.  Once
created, this index is updated in the archive whenever `ar' makes a
change to its contents (save for the `q' update operation).  An archive
with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and allows
routines in the library to call each other without regard to their
placement in the archive.

   You may use `nm -s' or `nm --print-armap' to list this index table.
If an archive lacks the table, another form of `ar' called `ranlib' can
be used to add just the table.

   GNU `ar' can optionally create a _thin_ archive, which contains a
symbol index and references to the original copies of the member files
of the archive.  This is useful for building libraries for use within a
local build tree, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain
available, and copying the contents of each object would only waste
time and space.

   An archive can either be _thin_ or it can be normal.  It cannot be
both at the same time.  Once an archive is created its format cannot be
changed without first deleting it and then creating a new archive in
its place.

   Thin archives are also _flattened_, so that adding one thin archive
to another thin archive does not nest it, as would happen with a normal
archive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are added
individually to the second archive.

   The paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to the
archive itself.

   GNU `ar' is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.
You can control its activity using command-line options, like the
different varieties of `ar' on Unix systems; or, if you specify the
single command-line option `-M', you can control it with a script
supplied via standard input, like the MRI "librarian" program.

1.1 Controlling `ar' on the Command Line
========================================

     ar [`-X32_64'] [`-']P[MOD] [`--plugin' NAME] [`--target' BFDNAME] [RELPOS] [COUNT] ARCHIVE [MEMBER...]

   When you use `ar' in the Unix style, `ar' insists on at least two
arguments to execute: one keyletter specifying the _operation_
(optionally accompanied by other keyletters specifying _modifiers_),
and the archive name to act on.

   Most operations can also accept further MEMBER arguments, specifying
particular files to operate on.

   GNU `ar' allows you to mix the operation code P and modifier flags
MOD in any order, within the first command-line argument.

   If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
dash.

   The P keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be any
of the following, but you must specify only one of them:

`d'
     _Delete_ modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
     be deleted as MEMBER...; the archive is untouched if you specify
     no files to delete.

     If you specify the `v' modifier, `ar' lists each module as it is
     deleted.

`m'
     Use this operation to _move_ members in an archive.

     The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
     programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in
     more than one member.

     If no modifiers are used with `m', any members you name in the
     MEMBER arguments are moved to the _end_ of the archive; you can
     use the `a', `b', or `i' modifiers to move them to a specified
     place instead.

`p'
     _Print_ the specified members of the archive, to the standard
     output file.  If the `v' modifier is specified, show the member
     name before copying its contents to standard output.

     If you specify no MEMBER arguments, all the files in the archive
     are printed.

`q'
     _Quick append_; Historically, add the files MEMBER... to the end of
     ARCHIVE, without checking for replacement.

     The modifiers `a', `b', and `i' do _not_ affect this operation;
     new members are always placed at the end of the archive.

     The modifier `v' makes `ar' list each file as it is appended.

     Since the point of this operation is speed, implementations of
     `ar' have the option of not updating the archive's symbol table if
     one exists.  Too many different systems however assume that symbol
     tables are always up-to-date, so GNU `ar' will rebuild the table
     even with a quick append.

     Note - GNU `ar' treats the command `qs' as a synonym for `r' -
     replacing already existing files in the archive and appending new
     ones at the end.

`r'
     Insert the files MEMBER... into ARCHIVE (with _replacement_). This
     operation differs from `q' in that any previously existing members
     are deleted if their names match those being added.

     If one of the files named in MEMBER... does not exist, `ar'
     displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing
     members of the archive matching that name.

     By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you
     may use one of the modifiers `a', `b', or `i' to request placement
     relative to some existing member.

     The modifier `v' used with this operation elicits a line of output
     for each file inserted, along with one of the letters `a' or `r'
     to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member deleted)
     or replaced.

`s'
     Add an index to the archive, or update it if it already exists.
     Note this command is an exception to the rule that there can only
     be one command letter, as it is possible to use it as either a
     command or a modifier.  In either case it does the same thing.

`t'
     Display a _table_ listing the contents of ARCHIVE, or those of the
     files listed in MEMBER... that are present in the archive.
     Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to see
     the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can
     request that by also specifying the `v' modifier.

     If you do not specify a MEMBER, all files in the archive are
     listed.

     If there is more than one file with the same name (say, `fie') in
     an archive (say `b.a'), `ar t b.a fie' lists only the first
     instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete listing--in
     our example, `ar t b.a'.

`x'
     _Extract_ members (named MEMBER) from the archive.  You can use
     the `v' modifier with this operation, to request that `ar' list
     each name as it extracts it.

     If you do not specify a MEMBER, all files in the archive are
     extracted.

     Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive.

`--help'
     Displays the list of command line options supported by `ar' and
     then exits.

`--version'
     Displays the version information of `ar' and then exits.


   A number of modifiers (MOD) may immediately follow the P keyletter,
to specify variations on an operation's behavior:

`a'
     Add new files _after_ an existing member of the archive.  If you
     use the modifier `a', the name of an existing archive member must
     be present as the RELPOS argument, before the ARCHIVE
     specification.

`b'
     Add new files _before_ an existing member of the archive.  If you
     use the modifier `b', the name of an existing archive member must
     be present as the RELPOS argument, before the ARCHIVE
     specification.  (same as `i').

`c'
     _Create_ the archive.  The specified ARCHIVE is always created if
     it did not exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
     issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it,
     by using this modifier.

`D'
     Operate in _deterministic_ mode.  When adding files and the archive
     index use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and use consistent file
     modes for all files.  When this option is used, if `ar' is used
     with identical options and identical input files, multiple runs
     will create identical output files regardless of the input files'
     owners, groups, file modes, or modification times.

     If `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives', then this mode is on by default.
     It can be disabled with the `U' modifier, below.

`f'
     Truncate names in the archive.  GNU `ar' will normally permit file
     names of any length.  This will cause it to create archives which
     are not compatible with the native `ar' program on some systems.
     If this is a concern, the `f' modifier may be used to truncate file
     names when putting them in the archive.

`i'
     Insert new files _before_ an existing member of the archive.  If
     you use the modifier `i', the name of an existing archive member
     must be present as the RELPOS argument, before the ARCHIVE
     specification.  (same as `b').

`l'
     This modifier is accepted but not used.

`N'
     Uses the COUNT parameter.  This is used if there are multiple
     entries in the archive with the same name.  Extract or delete
     instance COUNT of the given name from the archive.

`o'
     Preserve the _original_ dates of members when extracting them.  If
     you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
     are stamped with the time of extraction.

`P'
     Use the full path name when matching names in the archive.  GNU
     `ar' can not create an archive with a full path name (such archives
     are not POSIX complaint), but other archive creators can.  This
     option will cause GNU `ar' to match file names using a complete
     path name, which can be convenient when extracting a single file
     from an archive created by another tool.

`s'
     Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing
     one, even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use
     this modifier flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running
     `ar s' on an archive is equivalent to running `ranlib' on it.

`S'
     Do not generate an archive symbol table.  This can speed up
     building a large library in several steps.  The resulting archive
     can not be used with the linker.  In order to build a symbol
     table, you must omit the `S' modifier on the last execution of
     `ar', or you must run `ranlib' on the archive.

`T'
     Make the specified ARCHIVE a _thin_ archive.  If it already exists
     and is a regular archive, the existing members must be present in
     the same directory as ARCHIVE.

`u'
     Normally, `ar r'... inserts all files listed into the archive.  If
     you would like to insert _only_ those of the files you list that
     are newer than existing members of the same names, use this
     modifier.  The `u' modifier is allowed only for the operation `r'
     (replace).  In particular, the combination `qu' is not allowed,
     since checking the timestamps would lose any speed advantage from
     the operation `q'.

`U'
     Do _not_ operate in _deterministic_ mode.  This is the inverse of
     the `D' modifier, above: added files and the archive index will
     get their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.

     This is the default unless `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives'.

`v'
     This modifier requests the _verbose_ version of an operation.  Many
     operations display additional information, such as filenames
     processed, when the modifier `v' is appended.

`V'
     This modifier shows the version number of `ar'.

   `ar' ignores an initial option spelt `-X32_64', for compatibility
with AIX.  The behaviour produced by this option is the default for GNU
`ar'.  `ar' does not support any of the other `-X' options; in
particular, it does not support `-X32' which is the default for AIX
`ar'.

   The optional command line switch `--plugin' NAME causes `ar' to load
the plugin called NAME which adds support for more file formats.  This
option is only available if the toolchain has been built with plugin
support enabled.

   The optional command line switch `--target' BFDNAME specifies that
the archive members are in an object code format different from your
system's default format.  See *Note Target Selection::, for more
information.

1.2 Controlling `ar' with a Script
==================================

     ar -M [ <SCRIPT ]

   If you use the single command-line option `-M' with `ar', you can
control its operation with a rudimentary command language.  This form
of `ar' operates interactively if standard input is coming directly
from a terminal.  During interactive use, `ar' prompts for input (the
prompt is `AR >'), and continues executing even after errors.  If you
redirect standard input to a script file, no prompts are issued, and
`ar' abandons execution (with a nonzero exit code) on any error.

   The `ar' command language is _not_ designed to be equivalent to the
command-line options; in fact, it provides somewhat less control over
archives.  The only purpose of the command language is to ease the
transition to GNU `ar' for developers who already have scripts written
for the MRI "librarian" program.

   The syntax for the `ar' command language is straightforward:
   * commands are recognized in upper or lower case; for example, `LIST'
     is the same as `list'.  In the following descriptions, commands are
     shown in upper case for clarity.

   * a single command may appear on each line; it is the first word on
     the line.

   * empty lines are allowed, and have no effect.

   * comments are allowed; text after either of the characters `*' or
     `;' is ignored.

   * Whenever you use a list of names as part of the argument to an `ar'
     command, you can separate the individual names with either commas
     or blanks.  Commas are shown in the explanations below, for
     clarity.

   * `+' is used as a line continuation character; if `+' appears at
     the end of a line, the text on the following line is considered
     part of the current command.

   Here are the commands you can use in `ar' scripts, or when using
`ar' interactively.  Three of them have special significance:

   `OPEN' or `CREATE' specify a "current archive", which is a temporary
file required for most of the other commands.

   `SAVE' commits the changes so far specified by the script.  Prior to
`SAVE', commands affect only the temporary copy of the current archive.

`ADDLIB ARCHIVE'
`ADDLIB ARCHIVE (MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE)'
     Add all the contents of ARCHIVE (or, if specified, each named
     MODULE from ARCHIVE) to the current archive.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`ADDMOD MEMBER, MEMBER, ... MEMBER'
     Add each named MEMBER as a module in the current archive.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`CLEAR'
     Discard the contents of the current archive, canceling the effect
     of any operations since the last `SAVE'.  May be executed (with no
     effect) even if  no current archive is specified.

`CREATE ARCHIVE'
     Creates an archive, and makes it the current archive (required for
     many other commands).  The new archive is created with a temporary
     name; it is not actually saved as ARCHIVE until you use `SAVE'.
     You can overwrite existing archives; similarly, the contents of any
     existing file named ARCHIVE will not be destroyed until `SAVE'.

`DELETE MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE'
     Delete each listed MODULE from the current archive; equivalent to
     `ar -d ARCHIVE MODULE ... MODULE'.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`DIRECTORY ARCHIVE (MODULE, ... MODULE)'
`DIRECTORY ARCHIVE (MODULE, ... MODULE) OUTPUTFILE'
     List each named MODULE present in ARCHIVE.  The separate command
     `VERBOSE' specifies the form of the output: when verbose output is
     off, output is like that of `ar -t ARCHIVE MODULE...'.  When
     verbose output is on, the listing is like `ar -tv ARCHIVE
     MODULE...'.

     Output normally goes to the standard output stream; however, if you
     specify OUTPUTFILE as a final argument, `ar' directs the output to
     that file.

`END'
     Exit from `ar', with a `0' exit code to indicate successful
     completion.  This command does not save the output file; if you
     have changed the current archive since the last `SAVE' command,
     those changes are lost.

`EXTRACT MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE'
     Extract each named MODULE from the current archive, writing them
     into the current directory as separate files.  Equivalent to `ar -x
     ARCHIVE MODULE...'.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`LIST'
     Display full contents of the current archive, in "verbose" style
     regardless of the state of `VERBOSE'.  The effect is like `ar tv
     ARCHIVE'.  (This single command is a GNU `ar' enhancement, rather
     than present for MRI compatibility.)

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`OPEN ARCHIVE'
     Opens an existing archive for use as the current archive (required
     for many other commands).  Any changes as the result of subsequent
     commands will not actually affect ARCHIVE until you next use
     `SAVE'.

`REPLACE MODULE, MODULE, ... MODULE'
     In the current archive, replace each existing MODULE (named in the
     `REPLACE' arguments) from files in the current working directory.
     To execute this command without errors, both the file, and the
     module in the current archive, must exist.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

`VERBOSE'
     Toggle an internal flag governing the output from `DIRECTORY'.
     When the flag is on, `DIRECTORY' output matches output from `ar
     -tv '....

`SAVE'
     Commit your changes to the current archive, and actually save it
     as a file with the name specified in the last `CREATE' or `OPEN'
     command.

     Requires prior use of `OPEN' or `CREATE'.

        [OBJFILE...]

   GNU `nm' lists the symbols from object files OBJFILE....  If no
object files are listed as arguments, `nm' assumes the file `a.out'.

   For each symbol, `nm' shows:

   * The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or
     hexadecimal by default.

   * The symbol type.  At least the following types are used; others
     are, as well, depending on the object file format.  If lowercase,
     the symbol is usually local; if uppercase, the symbol is global
     (external).  There are however a few lowercase symbols that are
     shown for special global symbols (`u', `v' and `w').

    `A'
          The symbol's value is absolute, and will not be changed by
          further linking.

    `B'
    `b'
          The symbol is in the uninitialized data section (known as
          BSS).

    `C'
          The symbol is common.  Common symbols are uninitialized data.
          When linking, multiple common symbols may appear with the
          same name.  If the symbol is defined anywhere, the common
          symbols are treated as undefined references.  For more
          details on common symbols, see the discussion of -warn-common
          in *note Linker options: (ld.info)Options.

    `D'
    `d'
          The symbol is in the initialized data section.

    `G'
    `g'
          The symbol is in an initialized data section for small
          objects.  Some object file formats permit more efficient
          access to small data objects, such as a global int variable
          as opposed to a large global array.

    `i'
          For PE format files this indicates that the symbol is in a
          section specific to the implementation of DLLs.  For ELF
          format files this indicates that the symbol is an indirect
          function.  This is a GNU extension to the standard set of ELF
          symbol types.  It indicates a symbol which if referenced by a
          relocation does not evaluate to its address, but instead must
          be invoked at runtime.  The runtime execution will then
          return the value to be used in the relocation.

    `I'
          The symbol is an indirect reference to another symbol.

    `N'
          The symbol is a debugging symbol.

    `p'
          The symbols is in a stack unwind section.

    `R'
    `r'
          The symbol is in a read only data section.

    `S'
    `s'
          The symbol is in an uninitialized data section for small
          objects.

    `T'
    `t'
          The symbol is in the text (code) section.

    `U'
          The symbol is undefined.

    `u'
          The symbol is a unique global symbol.  This is a GNU
          extension to the standard set of ELF symbol bindings.  For
          such a symbol the dynamic linker will make sure that in the
          entire process there is just one symbol with this name and
          type in use.

    `V'
    `v'
          The symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined symbol is
          linked with a normal defined symbol, the normal defined
          symbol is used with no error.  When a weak undefined symbol
          is linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of the
          weak symbol becomes zero with no error.  On some systems,
          uppercase indicates that a default value has been specified.

    `W'
    `w'
          The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been specifically
          tagged as a weak object symbol.  When a weak defined symbol
          is linked with a normal defined symbol, the normal defined
          symbol is used with no error.  When a weak undefined symbol
          is linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of the
          symbol is determined in a system-specific manner without
          error.  On some systems, uppercase indicates that a default
          value has been specified.

    `-'
          The symbol is a stabs symbol in an a.out object file.  In
          this case, the next values printed are the stabs other field,
          the stabs desc field, and the stab type.  Stabs symbols are
          used to hold debugging information.

    `?'
          The symbol type is unknown, or object file format specific.

   * The symbol name.

   The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.

`-A'
`-o'
`--print-file-name'
     Precede each symbol by the name of the input file (or archive
     member) in which it was found, rather than identifying the input
     file once only, before all of its symbols.

`-a'
`--debug-syms'
     Display all symbols, even debugger-only symbols; normally these
     are not listed.

`-B'
     The same as `--format=bsd' (for compatibility with the MIPS `nm').

`-C'
`--demangle[=STYLE]'
     Decode ("demangle") low-level symbol names into user-level names.
     Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system,
     this makes C++ function names readable. Different compilers have
     different mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument
     can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
     compiler. *Note c++filt::, for more information on demangling.

`--no-demangle'
     Do not demangle low-level symbol names.  This is the default.

`-D'
`--dynamic'
     Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.  This
     is only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of
     shared libraries.

`-f FORMAT'
`--format=FORMAT'
     Use the output format FORMAT, which can be `bsd', `sysv', or
     `posix'.  The default is `bsd'.  Only the first character of
     FORMAT is significant; it can be either upper or lower case.

`-g'
`--extern-only'
     Display only external symbols.

`-h'
`--help'
     Show a summary of the options to `nm' and exit.

`-l'
`--line-numbers'
     For each symbol, use debugging information to try to find a
     filename and line number.  For a defined symbol, look for the line
     number of the address of the symbol.  For an undefined symbol,
     look for the line number of a relocation entry which refers to the
     symbol.  If line number information can be found, print it after
     the other symbol information.

`-n'
`-v'
`--numeric-sort'
     Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, rather than
     alphabetically by their names.

`-p'
`--no-sort'
     Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print them in the
     order encountered.

`-P'
`--portability'
     Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the default
     format.  Equivalent to `-f posix'.

`-r'
`--reverse-sort'
     Reverse the order of the sort (whether numeric or alphabetic); let
     the last come first.

`-S'
`--print-size'
     Print both value and size of defined symbols for the `bsd' output
     style.  This option has no effect for object formats that do not
     record symbol sizes, unless `--size-sort' is also used in which
     case a calculated size is displayed.

`-s'
`--print-armap'
     When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a
     mapping (stored in the archive by `ar' or `ranlib') of which
     modules contain definitions for which names.

`-t RADIX'
`--radix=RADIX'
     Use RADIX as the radix for printing the symbol values.  It must be
     `d' for decimal, `o' for octal, or `x' for hexadecimal.

`-u'
`--undefined-only'
     Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object
     file).

`-V'
`--version'
     Show the version number of `nm' and exit.

`-X'
     This option is ignored for compatibility with the AIX version of
     `nm'.  It takes one parameter which must be the string `32_64'.
     The default mode of AIX `nm' corresponds to `-X 32', which is not
     supported by GNU `nm'.

`--defined-only'
     Display only defined symbols for each object file.

`--plugin NAME'
     Load the plugin called NAME to add support for extra target types.
     This option is only available if the toolchain has been built with
     plugin support enabled.

`--size-sort'
     Sort symbols by size.  The size is computed as the difference
     between the value of the symbol and the value of the symbol with
     the next higher value.  If the `bsd' output format is used the
     size of the symbol is printed, rather than the value, and `-S'
     must be used in order both size and value to be printed.

`--special-syms'
     Display symbols which have a target-specific special meaning.
     These symbols are usually used by the target for some special
     processing and are not normally helpful when included in the
     normal symbol lists.  For example for ARM targets this option
     would skip the mapping symbols used to mark transitions between
     ARM code, THUMB code and data.

`--synthetic'
     Include synthetic symbols in the output.  These are special symbols
     created by the linker for various purposes.  They are not shown by
     default since they are not part of the binary's original source
     code.

`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify an object code format other than your system's default
     format.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

             INFILE [OUTFILE]

   The GNU `objcopy' utility copies the contents of an object file to
another.  `objcopy' uses the GNU BFD Library to read and write the
object files.  It can write the destination object file in a format
different from that of the source object file.  The exact behavior of
`objcopy' is controlled by command-line options.  Note that `objcopy'
should be able to copy a fully linked file between any two formats.
However, copying a relocatable object file between any two formats may
not work as expected.

   `objcopy' creates temporary files to do its translations and deletes
them afterward.  `objcopy' uses BFD to do all its translation work; it
has access to all the formats described in BFD and thus is able to
recognize most formats without being told explicitly.  *Note BFD:
(ld.info)BFD.

   `objcopy' can be used to generate S-records by using an output
target of `srec' (e.g., use `-O srec').

   `objcopy' can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an
output target of `binary' (e.g., use `-O binary').  When `objcopy'
generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce a memory dump
of the contents of the input object file.  All symbols and relocation
information will be discarded.  The memory dump will start at the load
address of the lowest section copied into the output file.

   When generating an S-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful
to use `-S' to remove sections containing debugging information.  In
some cases `-R' will be useful to remove sections which contain
information that is not needed by the binary file.

   Note--`objcopy' is not able to change the endianness of its input
files.  If the input format has an endianness (some formats do not),
`objcopy' can only copy the inputs into file formats that have the same
endianness or which have no endianness (e.g., `srec').  (However, see
the `--reverse-bytes' option.)

`INFILE'
`OUTFILE'
     The input and output files, respectively.  If you do not specify
     OUTFILE, `objcopy' creates a temporary file and destructively
     renames the result with the name of INFILE.

`-I BFDNAME'
`--input-target=BFDNAME'
     Consider the source file's object format to be BFDNAME, rather than
     attempting to deduce it.  *Note Target Selection::, for more
     information.

`-O BFDNAME'
`--output-target=BFDNAME'
     Write the output file using the object format BFDNAME.  *Note
     Target Selection::, for more information.

`-F BFDNAME'
`--target=BFDNAME'
     Use BFDNAME as the object format for both the input and the output
     file; i.e., simply transfer data from source to destination with no
     translation.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

`-B BFDARCH'
`--binary-architecture=BFDARCH'
     Useful when transforming a architecture-less input file into an
     object file.  In this case the output architecture can be set to
     BFDARCH.  This option will be ignored if the input file has a
     known BFDARCH.  You can access this binary data inside a program
     by referencing the special symbols that are created by the
     conversion process.  These symbols are called
     _binary_OBJFILE_start, _binary_OBJFILE_end and
     _binary_OBJFILE_size.  e.g. you can transform a picture file into
     an object file and then access it in your code using these symbols.

`-j SECTIONPATTERN'
`--only-section=SECTIONPATTERN'
     Copy only the indicated sections from the input file to the output
     file.  This option may be given more than once.  Note that using
     this option inappropriately may make the output file unusable.
     Wildcard characters are accepted in SECTIONPATTERN.

`-R SECTIONPATTERN'
`--remove-section=SECTIONPATTERN'
     Remove any section matching SECTIONPATTERN from the output file.
     This option may be given more than once.  Note that using this
     option inappropriately may make the output file unusable.  Wildcard
     characters are accepted in SECTIONPATTERN.  Using both the `-j'
     and `-R' options together results in undefined behaviour.

`-S'
`--strip-all'
     Do not copy relocation and symbol information from the source file.

`-g'
`--strip-debug'
     Do not copy debugging symbols or sections from the source file.

`--strip-unneeded'
     Strip all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.

`-K SYMBOLNAME'
`--keep-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     When stripping symbols, keep symbol SYMBOLNAME even if it would
     normally be stripped.  This option may be given more than once.

`-N SYMBOLNAME'
`--strip-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Do not copy symbol SYMBOLNAME from the source file.  This option
     may be given more than once.

`--strip-unneeded-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Do not copy symbol SYMBOLNAME from the source file unless it is
     needed by a relocation.  This option may be given more than once.

`-G SYMBOLNAME'
`--keep-global-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Keep only symbol SYMBOLNAME global.  Make all other symbols local
     to the file, so that they are not visible externally.  This option
     may be given more than once.

`--localize-hidden'
     In an ELF object, mark all symbols that have hidden or internal
     visibility as local.  This option applies on top of
     symbol-specific localization options such as `-L'.

`-L SYMBOLNAME'
`--localize-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Make symbol SYMBOLNAME local to the file, so that it is not
     visible externally.  This option may be given more than once.

`-W SYMBOLNAME'
`--weaken-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Make symbol SYMBOLNAME weak. This option may be given more than
     once.

`--globalize-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Give symbol SYMBOLNAME global scoping so that it is visible
     outside of the file in which it is defined.  This option may be
     given more than once.

`-w'
`--wildcard'
     Permit regular expressions in SYMBOLNAMEs used in other command
     line options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\)
     and square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the
     symbol name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the
     exclamation point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for
     that symbol.  For example:

            -w -W !foo -W fo*

     would cause objcopy to weaken all symbols that start with "fo"
     except for the symbol "foo".

`-x'
`--discard-all'
     Do not copy non-global symbols from the source file.

`-X'
`--discard-locals'
     Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually
     start with `L' or `.'.)

`-b BYTE'
`--byte=BYTE'
     If interleaving has been enabled via the `--interleave' option
     then start the range of bytes to keep at the BYTEth byte.  BYTE
     can be in the range from 0 to BREADTH-1, where BREADTH is the
     value given by the `--interleave' option.

`-i [BREADTH]'
`--interleave[=BREADTH]'
     Only copy a range out of every BREADTH bytes.  (Header data is not
     affected).  Select which byte in the range begins the copy with
     the `--byte' option.  Select the width of the range with the
     `--interleave-width' option.

     This option is useful for creating files to program ROM.  It is
     typically used with an `srec' output target.  Note that `objcopy'
     will complain if you do not specify the `--byte' option as well.

     The default interleave breadth is 4, so with `--byte' set to 0,
     `objcopy' would copy the first byte out of every four bytes from
     the input to the output.

`--interleave-width=WIDTH'
     When used with the `--interleave' option, copy WIDTH bytes at a
     time.  The start of the range of bytes to be copied is set by the
     `--byte' option, and the extent of the range is set with the
     `--interleave' option.

     The default value for this option is 1.  The value of WIDTH plus
     the BYTE value set by the `--byte' option must not exceed the
     interleave breadth set by the `--interleave' option.

     This option can be used to create images for two 16-bit flashes
     interleaved in a 32-bit bus by passing `-b 0 -i 4
     --interleave-width=2' and `-b 2 -i 4 --interleave-width=2' to two
     `objcopy' commands.  If the input was '12345678' then the outputs
     would be '1256' and '3478' respectively.

`-p'
`--preserve-dates'
     Set the access and modification dates of the output file to be the
     same as those of the input file.

`-D'
`--enable-deterministic-archives'
     Operate in _deterministic_ mode.  When copying archive members and
     writing the archive index, use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps,
     and use consistent file modes for all files.

     If `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives', then this mode is on by default.
     It can be disabled with the `-U' option, below.

`-U'
`--disable-deterministic-archives'
     Do _not_ operate in _deterministic_ mode.  This is the inverse of
     the `-D' option, above: when copying archive members and writing
     the archive index, use their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file
     mode values.

     This is the default unless `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives'.

`--debugging'
     Convert debugging information, if possible.  This is not the
     default because only certain debugging formats are supported, and
     the conversion process can be time consuming.

`--gap-fill VAL'
     Fill gaps between sections with VAL.  This operation applies to
     the _load address_ (LMA) of the sections.  It is done by increasing
     the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in the
     extra space created with VAL.

`--pad-to ADDRESS'
     Pad the output file up to the load address ADDRESS.  This is done
     by increasing the size of the last section.  The extra space is
     filled in with the value specified by `--gap-fill' (default zero).

`--set-start VAL'
     Set the start address of the new file to VAL.  Not all object file
     formats support setting the start address.

`--change-start INCR'
`--adjust-start INCR'
     Change the start address by adding INCR.  Not all object file
     formats support setting the start address.

`--change-addresses INCR'
`--adjust-vma INCR'
     Change the VMA and LMA addresses of all sections, as well as the
     start address, by adding INCR.  Some object file formats do not
     permit section addresses to be changed arbitrarily.  Note that
     this does not relocate the sections; if the program expects
     sections to be loaded at a certain address, and this option is
     used to change the sections such that they are loaded at a
     different address, the program may fail.

`--change-section-address SECTIONPATTERN{=,+,-}VAL'
`--adjust-section-vma SECTIONPATTERN{=,+,-}VAL'
     Set or change both the VMA address and the LMA address of any
     section matching SECTIONPATTERN.  If `=' is used, the section
     address is set to VAL.  Otherwise, VAL is added to or subtracted
     from the section address.  See the comments under
     `--change-addresses', above. If SECTIONPATTERN does not match any
     sections in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless
     `--no-change-warnings' is used.

`--change-section-lma SECTIONPATTERN{=,+,-}VAL'
     Set or change the LMA address of any sections matching
     SECTIONPATTERN.  The LMA address is the address where the section
     will be loaded into memory at program load time.  Normally this is
     the same as the VMA address, which is the address of the section
     at program run time, but on some systems, especially those where a
     program is held in ROM, the two can be different.  If `=' is used,
     the section address is set to VAL.  Otherwise, VAL is added to or
     subtracted from the section address.  See the comments under
     `--change-addresses', above.  If SECTIONPATTERN does not match any
     sections in the input file, a warning will be issued, unless
     `--no-change-warnings' is used.

`--change-section-vma SECTIONPATTERN{=,+,-}VAL'
     Set or change the VMA address of any section matching
     SECTIONPATTERN.  The VMA address is the address where the section
     will be located once the program has started executing.  Normally
     this is the same as the LMA address, which is the address where
     the section will be loaded into memory, but on some systems,
     especially those where a program is held in ROM, the two can be
     different.  If `=' is used, the section address is set to VAL.
     Otherwise, VAL is added to or subtracted from the section address.
     See the comments under `--change-addresses', above.  If
     SECTIONPATTERN does not match any sections in the input file, a
     warning will be issued, unless `--no-change-warnings' is used.

`--change-warnings'
`--adjust-warnings'
     If `--change-section-address' or `--change-section-lma' or
     `--change-section-vma' is used, and the section pattern does not
     match any sections, issue a warning.  This is the default.

`--no-change-warnings'
`--no-adjust-warnings'
     Do not issue a warning if `--change-section-address' or
     `--adjust-section-lma' or `--adjust-section-vma' is used, even if
     the section pattern does not match any sections.

`--set-section-flags SECTIONPATTERN=FLAGS'
     Set the flags for any sections matching SECTIONPATTERN.  The FLAGS
     argument is a comma separated string of flag names.  The
     recognized names are `alloc', `contents', `load', `noload',
     `readonly', `code', `data', `rom', `share', and `debug'.  You can
     set the `contents' flag for a section which does not have
     contents, but it is not meaningful to clear the `contents' flag of
     a section which does have contents-just remove the section
     instead.  Not all flags are meaningful for all object file formats.

`--add-section SECTIONNAME=FILENAME'
     Add a new section named SECTIONNAME while copying the file.  The
     contents of the new section are taken from the file FILENAME.  The
     size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option only
     works on file formats which can support sections with arbitrary
     names.  Note - it may be necessary to use the `--set-section-flags'
     option to set the attributes of the newly created section.

`--dump-section SECTIONNAME=FILENAME'
     Place the contents of section named SECTIONNAME into the file
     FILENAME, overwriting any contents that may have been there
     previously.  This option is the inverse of `--add-section'.  This
     option is similar to the `--only-section' option except that it
     does not create a formatted file, it just dumps the contents as
     raw binary data, without applying any relocations.  The option can
     be specified more than once.

`--rename-section OLDNAME=NEWNAME[,FLAGS]'
     Rename a section from OLDNAME to NEWNAME, optionally changing the
     section's flags to FLAGS in the process.  This has the advantage
     over usng a linker script to perform the rename in that the output
     stays as an object file and does not become a linked executable.

     This option is particularly helpful when the input format is
     binary, since this will always create a section called .data.  If
     for example, you wanted instead to create a section called .rodata
     containing binary data you could use the following command line to
     achieve it:

            objcopy -I binary -O <output_format> -B <architecture> \
             --rename-section .data=.rodata,alloc,load,readonly,data,contents \
             <input_binary_file> <output_object_file>

`--long-section-names {enable,disable,keep}'
     Controls the handling of long section names when processing `COFF'
     and `PE-COFF' object formats.  The default behaviour, `keep', is
     to preserve long section names if any are present in the input
     file.  The `enable' and `disable' options forcibly enable or
     disable the use of long section names in the output object; when
     `disable' is in effect, any long section names in the input object
     will be truncated.  The `enable' option will only emit long
     section names if any are present in the inputs; this is mostly the
     same as `keep', but it is left undefined whether the `enable'
     option might force the creation of an empty string table in the
     output file.

`--change-leading-char'
     Some object file formats use special characters at the start of
     symbols.  The most common such character is underscore, which
     compilers often add before every symbol.  This option tells
     `objcopy' to change the leading character of every symbol when it
     converts between object file formats.  If the object file formats
     use the same leading character, this option has no effect.
     Otherwise, it will add a character, or remove a character, or
     change a character, as appropriate.

`--remove-leading-char'
     If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol
     leading character used by the object file format, remove the
     character.  The most common symbol leading character is
     underscore.  This option will remove a leading underscore from all
     global symbols.  This can be useful if you want to link together
     objects of different file formats with different conventions for
     symbol names.  This is different from `--change-leading-char'
     because it always changes the symbol name when appropriate,
     regardless of the object file format of the output file.

`--reverse-bytes=NUM'
     Reverse the bytes in a section with output contents.  A section
     length must be evenly divisible by the value given in order for
     the swap to be able to take place. Reversing takes place before
     the interleaving is performed.

     This option is used typically in generating ROM images for
     problematic target systems.  For example, on some target boards,
     the 32-bit words fetched from 8-bit ROMs are re-assembled in
     little-endian byte order regardless of the CPU byte order.
     Depending on the programming model, the endianness of the ROM may
     need to be modified.

     Consider a simple file with a section containing the following
     eight bytes:  `12345678'.

     Using `--reverse-bytes=2' for the above example, the bytes in the
     output file would be ordered `21436587'.

     Using `--reverse-bytes=4' for the above example, the bytes in the
     output file would be ordered `43218765'.

     By using `--reverse-bytes=2' for the above example, followed by
     `--reverse-bytes=4' on the output file, the bytes in the second
     output file would be ordered `34127856'.

`--srec-len=IVAL'
     Meaningful only for srec output.  Set the maximum length of the
     Srecords being produced to IVAL.  This length covers both address,
     data and crc fields.

`--srec-forceS3'
     Meaningful only for srec output.  Avoid generation of S1/S2
     records, creating S3-only record format.

`--redefine-sym OLD=NEW'
     Change the name of a symbol OLD, to NEW.  This can be useful when
     one is trying link two things together for which you have no
     source, and there are name collisions.

`--redefine-syms=FILENAME'
     Apply `--redefine-sym' to each symbol pair "OLD NEW" listed in the
     file FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol
     pair per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash
     character.  This option may be given more than once.

`--weaken'
     Change all global symbols in the file to be weak.  This can be
     useful when building an object which will be linked against other
     objects using the `-R' option to the linker.  This option is only
     effective when using an object file format which supports weak
     symbols.

`--keep-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--keep-symbol' option to each symbol listed in the file
     FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol name
     per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
     This option may be given more than once.

`--strip-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--strip-symbol' option to each symbol listed in the file
     FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol name
     per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
     This option may be given more than once.

`--strip-unneeded-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--strip-unneeded-symbol' option to each symbol listed in
     the file FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one
     symbol name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash
     character.  This option may be given more than once.

`--keep-global-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--keep-global-symbol' option to each symbol listed in the
     file FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol
     name per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash
     character.  This option may be given more than once.

`--localize-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--localize-symbol' option to each symbol listed in the file
     FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol name
     per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
     This option may be given more than once.

`--globalize-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--globalize-symbol' option to each symbol listed in the file
     FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol name
     per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
     This option may be given more than once.

`--weaken-symbols=FILENAME'
     Apply `--weaken-symbol' option to each symbol listed in the file
     FILENAME.  FILENAME is simply a flat file, with one symbol name
     per line.  Line comments may be introduced by the hash character.
     This option may be given more than once.

`--alt-machine-code=INDEX'
     If the output architecture has alternate machine codes, use the
     INDEXth code instead of the default one.  This is useful in case a
     machine is assigned an official code and the tool-chain adopts the
     new code, but other applications still depend on the original code
     being used.  For ELF based architectures if the INDEX alternative
     does not exist then the value is treated as an absolute number to
     be stored in the e_machine field of the ELF header.

`--writable-text'
     Mark the output text as writable.  This option isn't meaningful
     for all object file formats.

`--readonly-text'
     Make the output text write protected.  This option isn't
     meaningful for all object file formats.

`--pure'
     Mark the output file as demand paged.  This option isn't
     meaningful for all object file formats.

`--impure'
     Mark the output file as impure.  This option isn't meaningful for
     all object file formats.

`--prefix-symbols=STRING'
     Prefix all symbols in the output file with STRING.

`--prefix-sections=STRING'
     Prefix all section names in the output file with STRING.

`--prefix-alloc-sections=STRING'
     Prefix all the names of all allocated sections in the output file
     with STRING.

`--add-gnu-debuglink=PATH-TO-FILE'
     Creates a .gnu_debuglink section which contains a reference to
     PATH-TO-FILE and adds it to the output file.

`--keep-file-symbols'
     When stripping a file, perhaps with `--strip-debug' or
     `--strip-unneeded', retain any symbols specifying source file
     names, which would otherwise get stripped.

`--only-keep-debug'
     Strip a file, removing contents of any sections that would not be
     stripped by `--strip-debug' and leaving the debugging sections
     intact.  In ELF files, this preserves all note sections in the
     output.

     The intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with
     `--add-gnu-debuglink' to create a two part executable.  One a
     stripped binary which will occupy less space in RAM and in a
     distribution and the second a debugging information file which is
     only needed if debugging abilities are required.  The suggested
     procedure to create these files is as follows:

       1. Link the executable as normal.  Assuming that is is called
          `foo' then...

       2. Run `objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.dbg' to create a file
          containing the debugging info.

       3. Run `objcopy --strip-debug foo' to create a stripped
          executable.

       4. Run `objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg foo' to add a link
          to the debugging info into the stripped executable.

     Note--the choice of `.dbg' as an extension for the debug info file
     is arbitrary.  Also the `--only-keep-debug' step is optional.  You
     could instead do this:

       1. Link the executable as normal.

       2. Copy `foo' to  `foo.full'

       3. Run `objcopy --strip-debug foo'

       4. Run `objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo'

     i.e., the file pointed to by the `--add-gnu-debuglink' can be the
     full executable.  It does not have to be a file created by the
     `--only-keep-debug' switch.

     Note--this switch is only intended for use on fully linked files.
     It does not make sense to use it on object files where the
     debugging information may be incomplete.  Besides the
     gnu_debuglink feature currently only supports the presence of one
     filename containing debugging information, not multiple filenames
     on a one-per-object-file basis.

`--strip-dwo'
     Remove the contents of all DWARF .dwo sections, leaving the
     remaining debugging sections and all symbols intact.  This option
     is intended for use by the compiler as part of the `-gsplit-dwarf'
     option, which splits debug information between the .o file and a
     separate .dwo file.  The compiler generates all debug information
     in the same file, then uses the `--extract-dwo' option to copy the
     .dwo sections to the .dwo file, then the `--strip-dwo' option to
     remove those sections from the original .o file.

`--extract-dwo'
     Extract the contents of all DWARF .dwo sections.  See the
     `--strip-dwo' option for more information.

`--file-alignment NUM'
     Specify the file alignment.  Sections in the file will always
     begin at file offsets which are multiples of this number.  This
     defaults to 512.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

`--heap RESERVE'
`--heap RESERVE,COMMIT'
     Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally
     commit) to be used as heap for this program.  [This option is
     specific to PE targets.]

`--image-base VALUE'
     Use VALUE as the base address of your program or dll.  This is the
     lowest memory location that will be used when your program or dll
     is loaded.  To reduce the need to relocate and improve performance
     of your dlls, each should have a unique base address and not
     overlap any other dlls.  The default is 0x400000 for executables,
     and 0x10000000 for dlls.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

`--section-alignment NUM'
     Sets the section alignment.  Sections in memory will always begin
     at addresses which are a multiple of this number.  Defaults to
     0x1000.  [This option is specific to PE targets.]

`--stack RESERVE'
`--stack RESERVE,COMMIT'
     Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally
     commit) to be used as stack for this program.  [This option is
     specific to PE targets.]

`--subsystem WHICH'
`--subsystem WHICH:MAJOR'
`--subsystem WHICH:MAJOR.MINOR'
     Specifies the subsystem under which your program will execute.  The
     legal values for WHICH are `native', `windows', `console',
     `posix', `efi-app', `efi-bsd', `efi-rtd', `sal-rtd', and `xbox'.
     You may optionally set the subsystem version also.  Numeric values
     are also accepted for WHICH.  [This option is specific to PE
     targets.]

`--extract-symbol'
     Keep the file's section flags and symbols but remove all section
     data.  Specifically, the option:

        * removes the contents of all sections;

        * sets the size of every section to zero; and

        * sets the file's start address to zero.

     This option is used to build a `.sym' file for a VxWorks kernel.
     It can also be a useful way of reducing the size of a
     `--just-symbols' linker input file.

`--compress-debug-sections'
     Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib.

`--decompress-debug-sections'
     Decompress DWARF debug sections using zlib.

`-V'
`--version'
     Show the version number of `objcopy'.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
     archives, `objcopy -V' lists all members of the archive.

`--help'
     Show a summary of the options to `objcopy'.

`--info'
     Display a list showing all architectures and object formats
     available.

             OBJFILE...

   `objdump' displays information about one or more object files.  The
options control what particular information to display.  This
information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
program to compile and work.

   OBJFILE... are the object files to be examined.  When you specify
archives, `objdump' shows information on each of the member object
files.

   The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.  At least one option from the list
`-a,-d,-D,-e,-f,-g,-G,-h,-H,-p,-P,-r,-R,-s,-S,-t,-T,-V,-x' must be
given.

`-a'
`--archive-header'
     If any of the OBJFILE files are archives, display the archive
     header information (in a format similar to `ls -l').  Besides the
     information you could list with `ar tv', `objdump -a' shows the
     object file format of each archive member.

`--adjust-vma=OFFSET'
     When dumping information, first add OFFSET to all the section
     addresses.  This is useful if the section addresses do not
     correspond to the symbol table, which can happen when putting
     sections at particular addresses when using a format which can not
     represent section addresses, such as a.out.

`-b BFDNAME'
`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
     BFDNAME.  This option may not be necessary; OBJDUMP can
     automatically recognize many formats.

     For example,
          objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o
     displays summary information from the section headers (`-h') of
     `fu.o', which is explicitly identified (`-m') as a VAX object file
     in the format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the
     formats available with the `-i' option.  *Note Target Selection::,
     for more information.

`-C'
`--demangle[=STYLE]'
     Decode ("demangle") low-level symbol names into user-level names.
     Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system,
     this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
     different mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument
     can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
     compiler. *Note c++filt::, for more information on demangling.

`-g'
`--debugging'
     Display debugging information.  This attempts to parse STABS and
     IEEE debugging format information stored in the file and print it
     out using a C like syntax.  If neither of these formats are found
     this option falls back on the `-W' option to print any DWARF
     information in the file.

`-e'
`--debugging-tags'
     Like `-g', but the information is generated in a format compatible
     with ctags tool.

`-d'
`--disassemble'
     Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine instructions from
     OBJFILE.  This option only disassembles those sections which are
     expected to contain instructions.

`-D'
`--disassemble-all'
     Like `-d', but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
     those expected to contain instructions.

     If the target is an ARM architecture this switch also has the
     effect of forcing the disassembler to decode pieces of data found
     in code sections as if they were instructions.

`--prefix-addresses'
     When disassembling, print the complete address on each line.  This
     is the older disassembly format.

`-EB'
`-EL'
`--endian={big|little}'
     Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects
     disassembly.  This can be useful when disassembling a file format
     which does not describe endianness information, such as S-records.

`-f'
`--file-headers'
     Display summary information from the overall header of each of the
     OBJFILE files.

`-F'
`--file-offsets'
     When disassembling sections, whenever a symbol is displayed, also
     display the file offset of the region of data that is about to be
     dumped.  If zeroes are being skipped, then when disassembly
     resumes, tell the user how many zeroes were skipped and the file
     offset of the location from where the disassembly resumes.  When
     dumping sections, display the file offset of the location from
     where the dump starts.

`--file-start-context'
     Specify that when displaying interlisted source code/disassembly
     (assumes `-S') from a file that has not yet been displayed, extend
     the context to the start of the file.

`-h'
`--section-headers'
`--headers'
     Display summary information from the section headers of the object
     file.

     File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses, for
     example by using the `-Ttext', `-Tdata', or `-Tbss' options to
     `ld'.  However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not
     store the starting address of the file segments.  In those
     situations, although `ld' relocates the sections correctly, using
     `objdump -h' to list the file section headers cannot show the
     correct addresses.  Instead, it shows the usual addresses, which
     are implicit for the target.

`-H'
`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `objdump' and exit.

`-i'
`--info'
     Display a list showing all architectures and object formats
     available for specification with `-b' or `-m'.

`-j NAME'
`--section=NAME'
     Display information only for section NAME.

`-l'
`--line-numbers'
     Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename
     and source line numbers corresponding to the object code or relocs
     shown.  Only useful with `-d', `-D', or `-r'.

`-m MACHINE'
`--architecture=MACHINE'
     Specify the architecture to use when disassembling object files.
     This can be useful when disassembling object files which do not
     describe architecture information, such as S-records.  You can
     list the available architectures with the `-i' option.

     If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch has an
     additional effect.  It restricts the disassembly to only those
     instructions supported by the architecture specified by MACHINE.
     If it is necessary to use this switch because the input file does
     not contain any architecture information, but it is also desired to
     disassemble all the instructions use `-marm'.

`-M OPTIONS'
`--disassembler-options=OPTIONS'
     Pass target specific information to the disassembler.  Only
     supported on some targets.  If it is necessary to specify more
     than one disassembler option then multiple `-M' options can be
     used or can be placed together into a comma separated list.

     If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch can be used
     to select which register name set is used during disassembler.
     Specifying `-M reg-names-std' (the default) will select the
     register names as used in ARM's instruction set documentation, but
     with register 13 called 'sp', register 14 called 'lr' and register
     15 called 'pc'.  Specifying `-M reg-names-apcs' will select the
     name set used by the ARM Procedure Call Standard, whilst
     specifying `-M reg-names-raw' will just use `r' followed by the
     register number.

     There are also two variants on the APCS register naming scheme
     enabled by `-M reg-names-atpcs' and `-M reg-names-special-atpcs'
     which use the ARM/Thumb Procedure Call Standard naming
     conventions.  (Either with the normal register names or the
     special register names).

     This option can also be used for ARM architectures to force the
     disassembler to interpret all instructions as Thumb instructions by
     using the switch `--disassembler-options=force-thumb'.  This can be
     useful when attempting to disassemble thumb code produced by other
     compilers.

     For the x86, some of the options duplicate functions of the `-m'
     switch, but allow finer grained control.  Multiple selections from
     the following may be specified as a comma separated string.
     `x86-64', `i386' and `i8086' select disassembly for the given
     architecture.  `intel' and `att' select between intel syntax mode
     and AT&T syntax mode.  `intel-mnemonic' and `att-mnemonic' select
     between intel mnemonic mode and AT&T mnemonic mode.
     `intel-mnemonic' implies `intel' and `att-mnemonic' implies `att'.
     `addr64', `addr32', `addr16', `data32' and `data16' specify the
     default address size and operand size.  These four options will be
     overridden if `x86-64', `i386' or `i8086' appear later in the
     option string.  Lastly, `suffix', when in AT&T mode, instructs the
     disassembler to print a mnemonic suffix even when the suffix could
     be inferred by the operands.

     For PowerPC, `booke' controls the disassembly of BookE
     instructions.  `32' and `64' select PowerPC and PowerPC64
     disassembly, respectively.  `e300' selects disassembly for the
     e300 family.  `440' selects disassembly for the PowerPC 440.
     `ppcps' selects disassembly for the paired single instructions of
     the PPC750CL.

     For MIPS, this option controls the printing of instruction mnemonic
     names and register names in disassembled instructions.  Multiple
     selections from the following may be specified as a comma separated
     string, and invalid options are ignored:

    `no-aliases'
          Print the 'raw' instruction mnemonic instead of some pseudo
          instruction mnemonic.  I.e., print 'daddu' or 'or' instead of
          'move', 'sll' instead of 'nop', etc.

    `msa'
          Disassemble MSA instructions.

    `virt'
          Disassemble the virtualization ASE instructions.

    `xpa'
          Disassemble the eXtended Physical Address (XPA) ASE
          instructions.

    `gpr-names=ABI'
          Print GPR (general-purpose register) names as appropriate for
          the specified ABI.  By default, GPR names are selected
          according to the ABI of the binary being disassembled.

    `fpr-names=ABI'
          Print FPR (floating-point register) names as appropriate for
          the specified ABI.  By default, FPR numbers are printed
          rather than names.

    `cp0-names=ARCH'
          Print CP0 (system control coprocessor; coprocessor 0)
          register names as appropriate for the CPU or architecture
          specified by ARCH.  By default, CP0 register names are
          selected according to the architecture and CPU of the binary
          being disassembled.

    `hwr-names=ARCH'
          Print HWR (hardware register, used by the `rdhwr'
          instruction) names as appropriate for the CPU or architecture
          specified by ARCH.  By default, HWR names are selected
          according to the architecture and CPU of the binary being
          disassembled.

    `reg-names=ABI'
          Print GPR and FPR names as appropriate for the selected ABI.

    `reg-names=ARCH'
          Print CPU-specific register names (CP0 register and HWR names)
          as appropriate for the selected CPU or architecture.

     For any of the options listed above, ABI or ARCH may be specified
     as `numeric' to have numbers printed rather than names, for the
     selected types of registers.  You can list the available values of
     ABI and ARCH using the `--help' option.

     For VAX, you can specify function entry addresses with `-M
     entry:0xf00ba'.  You can use this multiple times to properly
     disassemble VAX binary files that don't contain symbol tables (like
     ROM dumps).  In these cases, the function entry mask would
     otherwise be decoded as VAX instructions, which would probably
     lead the rest of the function being wrongly disassembled.

`-p'
`--private-headers'
     Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The
     exact information printed depends upon the object file format.
     For some object file formats, no additional information is printed.

`-P OPTIONS'
`--private=OPTIONS'
     Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The
     argument OPTIONS is a comma separated list that depends on the
     format (the lists of options is displayed with the help).

     For XCOFF, the available options are: `header', `aout',
     `sections', `syms', `relocs', `lineno', `loader', `except',
     `typchk', `traceback', `toc' and `ldinfo'.

`-r'
`--reloc'
     Print the relocation entries of the file.  If used with `-d' or
     `-D', the relocations are printed interspersed with the
     disassembly.

`-R'
`--dynamic-reloc'
     Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only
     meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
     libraries.  As for `-r', if used with `-d' or `-D', the
     relocations are printed interspersed with the disassembly.

`-s'
`--full-contents'
     Display the full contents of any sections requested.  By default
     all non-empty sections are displayed.

`-S'
`--source'
     Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.
     Implies `-d'.

`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Specify PREFIX to add to the absolute paths when used with `-S'.

`--prefix-strip=LEVEL'
     Indicate how many initial directory names to strip off the
     hardwired absolute paths. It has no effect without
     `--prefix='PREFIX.

`--show-raw-insn'
     When disassembling instructions, print the instruction in hex as
     well as in symbolic form.  This is the default except when
     `--prefix-addresses' is used.

`--no-show-raw-insn'
     When disassembling instructions, do not print the instruction
     bytes.  This is the default when `--prefix-addresses' is used.

`--insn-width=WIDTH'
     Display WIDTH bytes on a single line when disassembling
     instructions.

`-W[lLiaprmfFsoRt]'
`--dwarf[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges,=pubtypes,=trace_info,=trace_abbrev,=trace_aranges,=gdb_index]'
     Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are
     present.  If one of the optional letters or words follows the
     switch then only data found in those specific sections will be
     dumped.

     Note that there is no single letter option to display the content
     of trace sections or .gdb_index.

     Note: the output from the `=info' option can also be affected by
     the options `--dwarf-depth', the `--dwarf-start' and the
     `--dwarf-check'.

`--dwarf-depth=N'
     Limit the dump of the `.debug_info' section to N children.  This
     is only useful with `--dwarf=info'.  The default is to print all
     DIEs; the special value 0 for N will also have this effect.

     With a non-zero value for N, DIEs at or deeper than N levels will
     not be printed.  The range for N is zero-based.

`--dwarf-start=N'
     Print only DIEs beginning with the DIE numbered N.  This is only
     useful with `--dwarf=info'.

     If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header
     information and all DIEs before the DIE numbered N.  Only siblings
     and children of the specified DIE will be printed.

     This can be used in conjunction with `--dwarf-depth'.

`--dwarf-check'
     Enable additional checks for consistency of Dwarf information.

`-G'
`--stabs'
     Display the full contents of any sections requested.  Display the
     contents of the .stab and .stab.index and .stab.excl sections from
     an ELF file.  This is only useful on systems (such as Solaris 2.0)
     in which `.stab' debugging symbol-table entries are carried in an
     ELF section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table
     entries are interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in
     the `--syms' output.

`--start-address=ADDRESS'
     Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the
     output of the `-d', `-r' and `-s' options.

`--stop-address=ADDRESS'
     Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the
     output of the `-d', `-r' and `-s' options.

`-t'
`--syms'
     Print the symbol table entries of the file.  This is similar to
     the information provided by the `nm' program, although the display
     format is different.  The format of the output depends upon the
     format of the file being dumped, but there are two main types.
     One looks like this:

          [  4](sec  3)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   3) (nx 1) 0x00000000 .bss
          [  6](sec  1)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   2) (nx 0) 0x00000000 fred

     where the number inside the square brackets is the number of the
     entry in the symbol table, the SEC number is the section number,
     the FL value are the symbol's flag bits, the TY number is the
     symbol's type, the SCL number is the symbol's storage class and
     the NX value is the number of auxilary entries associated with the
     symbol.  The last two fields are the symbol's value and its name.

     The other common output format, usually seen with ELF based files,
     looks like this:

          00000000 l    d  .bss   00000000 .bss
          00000000 g       .text  00000000 fred

     Here the first number is the symbol's value (sometimes refered to
     as its address).  The next field is actually a set of characters
     and spaces indicating the flag bits that are set on the symbol.
     These characters are described below.  Next is the section with
     which the symbol is associated or _*ABS*_ if the section is
     absolute (ie not connected with any section), or _*UND*_ if the
     section is referenced in the file being dumped, but not defined
     there.

     After the section name comes another field, a number, which for
     common symbols is the alignment and for other symbol is the size.
     Finally the symbol's name is displayed.

     The flag characters are divided into 7 groups as follows:
    `l'
    `g'
    `u'
    `!'
          The symbol is a local (l), global (g), unique global (u),
          neither global nor local (a space) or both global and local
          (!).  A symbol can be neither local or global for a variety
          of reasons, e.g., because it is used for debugging, but it is
          probably an indication of a bug if it is ever both local and
          global.  Unique global symbols are a GNU extension to the
          standard set of ELF symbol bindings.  For such a symbol the
          dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process
          there is just one symbol with this name and type in use.

    `w'
          The symbol is weak (w) or strong (a space).

    `C'
          The symbol denotes a constructor (C) or an ordinary symbol (a
          space).

    `W'
          The symbol is a warning (W) or a normal symbol (a space).  A
          warning symbol's name is a message to be displayed if the
          symbol following the warning symbol is ever referenced.

    `I'

    `i'
          The symbol is an indirect reference to another symbol (I), a
          function to be evaluated during reloc processing (i) or a
          normal symbol (a space).

    `d'
    `D'
          The symbol is a debugging symbol (d) or a dynamic symbol (D)
          or a normal symbol (a space).

    `F'

    `f'

    `O'
          The symbol is the name of a function (F) or a file (f) or an
          object (O) or just a normal symbol (a space).

`-T'
`--dynamic-syms'
     Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the file.  This is only
     meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
     libraries.  This is similar to the information provided by the `nm'
     program when given the `-D' (`--dynamic') option.

`--special-syms'
     When displaying symbols include those which the target considers
     to be special in some way and which would not normally be of
     interest to the user.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print the version number of `objdump' and exit.

`-x'
`--all-headers'
     Display all available header information, including the symbol
     table and relocation entries.  Using `-x' is equivalent to
     specifying all of `-a -f -h -p -r -t'.

`-w'
`--wide'
     Format some lines for output devices that have more than 80
     columns.  Also do not truncate symbol names when they are
     displayed.

`-z'
`--disassemble-zeroes'
     Normally the disassembly output will skip blocks of zeroes.  This
     option directs the disassembler to disassemble those blocks, just
     like any other data.

5 ranlib
********

     ranlib [`--plugin' NAME] [`-DhHvVt'] ARCHIVE

   `ranlib' generates an index to the contents of an archive and stores
it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a member of
an archive that is a relocatable object file.

   You may use `nm -s' or `nm --print-armap' to list this index.

   An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.

   The GNU `ranlib' program is another form of GNU `ar'; running
`ranlib' is completely equivalent to executing `ar -s'.  *Note ar::.

`-h'
`-H'
`--help'
     Show usage information for `ranlib'.

`-v'
`-V'
`--version'
     Show the version number of `ranlib'.

`-D'
     Operate in _deterministic_ mode.  The symbol map archive member's
     header will show zero for the UID, GID, and timestamp.  When this
     option is used, multiple runs will produce identical output files.

     If `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives', then this mode is on by
     default.  It can be disabled with the `-U' option, described below.

`-t'
     Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an archive.

`-U'
     Do _not_ operate in _deterministic_ mode.  This is the inverse of
     the `-D' option, above: the archive index will get actual UID,
     GID, timestamp, and file mode values.

     If `binutils' was configured _without_
     `--enable-deterministic-archives', then this mode is on by default.

          [`--target='BFDNAME] [`-V'|`--version']
          [OBJFILE...]

   The GNU `size' utility lists the section sizes--and the total
size--for each of the object or archive files OBJFILE in its argument
list.  By default, one line of output is generated for each object file
or each module in an archive.

   OBJFILE... are the object files to be examined.  If none are
specified, the file `a.out' will be used.

   The command line options have the following meanings:

`-A'
`-B'
`--format=COMPATIBILITY'
     Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from
     GNU `size' resembles output from System V `size' (using `-A', or
     `--format=sysv'), or Berkeley `size' (using `-B', or
     `--format=berkeley').  The default is the one-line format similar
     to Berkeley's.

     Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from
     `size':
          $ size --format=Berkeley ranlib size
          text    data    bss     dec     hex     filename
          294880  81920   11592   388392  5ed28   ranlib
          294880  81920   11888   388688  5ee50   size

     This is the same data, but displayed closer to System V
     conventions:

          $ size --format=SysV ranlib size
          ranlib  :
          section         size         addr

          Total         388688

`--help'
     Show a summary of acceptable arguments and options.

`-d'
`-o'
`-x'
`--radix=NUMBER'
     Using one of these options, you can control whether the size of
     each section is given in decimal (`-d', or `--radix=10'); octal
     (`-o', or `--radix=8'); or hexadecimal (`-x', or `--radix=16').
     In `--radix=NUMBER', only the three values (8, 10, 16) are
     supported.  The total size is always given in two radices; decimal
     and hexadecimal for `-d' or `-x' output, or octal and hexadecimal
     if you're using `-o'.

`--common'
     Print total size of common symbols in each file.  When using
     Berkeley format these are included in the bss size.

`-t'
`--totals'
     Show totals of all objects listed (Berkeley format listing mode
     only).

`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify that the object-code format for OBJFILE is BFDNAME.  This
     option may not be necessary; `size' can automatically recognize
     many formats.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

             [`-w'] [`--include-all-whitespace']
             [`--help'] [`--version'] FILE...

   For each FILE given, GNU `strings' prints the printable character
sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with
the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character.  By
default, it only prints the strings from the initialized and loaded
sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the
strings from the whole file.

   `strings' is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text
files.

`-a'
`--all'
`-'
     Do not scan only the initialized and loaded sections of object
     files; scan the whole files.

`-f'
`--print-file-name'
     Print the name of the file before each string.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the program usage on the standard output and
     exit.

`-MIN-LEN'
`-n MIN-LEN'
`--bytes=MIN-LEN'
     Print sequences of characters that are at least MIN-LEN characters
     long, instead of the default 4.

`-o'
     Like `-t o'.  Some other versions of `strings' have `-o' act like
     `-t d' instead.  Since we can not be compatible with both ways, we
     simply chose one.

`-t RADIX'
`--radix=RADIX'
     Print the offset within the file before each string.  The single
     character argument specifies the radix of the offset--`o' for
     octal, `x' for hexadecimal, or `d' for decimal.

`-e ENCODING'
`--encoding=ENCODING'
     Select the character encoding of the strings that are to be found.
     Possible values for ENCODING are: `s' = single-7-bit-byte
     characters (ASCII, ISO 8859, etc., default), `S' =
     single-8-bit-byte characters, `b' = 16-bit bigendian, `l' = 16-bit
     littleendian, `B' = 32-bit bigendian, `L' = 32-bit littleendian.
     Useful for finding wide character strings. (`l' and `b' apply to,
     for example, Unicode UTF-16/UCS-2 encodings).

`-T BFDNAME'
`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify an object code format other than your system's default
     format.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

`-v'
`-V'
`--version'
     Print the program version number on the standard output and exit.

`-w'
`--include-all-whitespace'
     By default tab and space characters are included in the strings
     that are displayed, but other whitespace characters, such a
     newlines and carriage returns, are not.  The `-w' option changes
     this so that all whitespace characters are considered to be part
     of a string.

     Treat the original OBJFILE as a file with the object code format
     BFDNAME.  *Note Target Selection::, for more information.

`-O BFDNAME'
`--output-target=BFDNAME'
     Replace OBJFILE with a file in the output format BFDNAME.  *Note
     Target Selection::, for more information.

`-R SECTIONNAME'
`--remove-section=SECTIONNAME'
     Remove any section named SECTIONNAME from the output file.  This
     option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option
     inappropriately may make the output file unusable.  The wildcard
     character `*' may be given at the end of SECTIONNAME.  If so, then
     any section starting with SECTIONNAME will be removed.

`-s'
`--strip-all'
     Remove all symbols.

`-g'
`-S'
`-d'
`--strip-debug'
     Remove debugging symbols only.

`--strip-dwo'
     Remove the contents of all DWARF .dwo sections, leaving the
     remaining debugging sections and all symbols intact.  See the
     description of this option in the `objcopy' section for more
     information.

`--strip-unneeded'
     Remove all symbols that are not needed for relocation processing.

`-K SYMBOLNAME'
`--keep-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     When stripping symbols, keep symbol SYMBOLNAME even if it would
     normally be stripped.  This option may be given more than once.

`-N SYMBOLNAME'
`--strip-symbol=SYMBOLNAME'
     Remove symbol SYMBOLNAME from the source file. This option may be
     given more than once, and may be combined with strip options other
     than `-K'.

`-o FILE'
     Put the stripped output in FILE, rather than replacing the
     existing file.  When this argument is used, only one OBJFILE
     argument may be specified.

`-p'
`--preserve-dates'
     Preserve the access and modification dates of the file.

`-D'
`--enable-deterministic-archives'
     Operate in _deterministic_ mode.  When copying archive members and
     writing the archive index, use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps,
     and use consistent file modes for all files.

     If `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives', then this mode is on by default.
     It can be disabled with the `-U' option, below.

`-U'
`--disable-deterministic-archives'
     Do _not_ operate in _deterministic_ mode.  This is the inverse of
     the `-D' option, above: when copying archive members and writing
     the archive index, use their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file
     mode values.

     This is the default unless `binutils' was configured with
     `--enable-deterministic-archives'.

`-w'
`--wildcard'
     Permit regular expressions in SYMBOLNAMEs used in other command
     line options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\)
     and square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the
     symbol name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the
     exclamation point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for
     that symbol.  For example:

            -w -K !foo -K fo*

     would cause strip to only keep symbols that start with the letters
     "fo", but to discard the symbol "foo".

`-x'
`--discard-all'
     Remove non-global symbols.

`-X'
`--discard-locals'
     Remove compiler-generated local symbols.  (These usually start
     with `L' or `.'.)

`--keep-file-symbols'
     When stripping a file, perhaps with `--strip-debug' or
     `--strip-unneeded', retain any symbols specifying source file
     names, which would otherwise get stripped.

`--only-keep-debug'
     Strip a file, removing contents of any sections that would not be
     stripped by `--strip-debug' and leaving the debugging sections
     intact.  In ELF files, this preserves all note sections in the
     output.

     The intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with
     `--add-gnu-debuglink' to create a two part executable.  One a
     stripped binary which will occupy less space in RAM and in a
     distribution and the second a debugging information file which is
     only needed if debugging abilities are required.  The suggested
     procedure to create these files is as follows:

       1. Link the executable as normal.  Assuming that is is called
          `foo' then...

       2. Run `objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.dbg' to create a file
          containing the debugging info.

       3. Run `objcopy --strip-debug foo' to create a stripped
          executable.

       4. Run `objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.dbg foo' to add a link
          to the debugging info into the stripped executable.

     Note--the choice of `.dbg' as an extension for the debug info file
     is arbitrary.  Also the `--only-keep-debug' step is optional.  You
     could instead do this:

       1. Link the executable as normal.

       2. Copy `foo' to `foo.full'

       3. Run `strip --strip-debug foo'

       4. Run `objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.full foo'

     i.e., the file pointed to by the `--add-gnu-debuglink' can be the
     full executable.  It does not have to be a file created by the
     `--only-keep-debug' switch.

     Note--this switch is only intended for use on fully linked files.
     It does not make sense to use it on object files where the
     debugging information may be incomplete.  Besides the
     gnu_debuglink feature currently only supports the presence of one
     filename containing debugging information, not multiple filenames
     on a one-per-object-file basis.

`-V'
`--version'
     Show the version number for `strip'.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Verbose output: list all object files modified.  In the case of
     archives, `strip -v' lists all members of the archive.

*********

     c++filt [`-_'|`--strip-underscore']
             [`-n'|`--no-strip-underscore']
             [`-p'|`--no-params']
             [`-t'|`--types']
             [`-i'|`--no-verbose']
             [`-s' FORMAT|`--format='FORMAT]
             [`--help']  [`--version']  [SYMBOL...]

   The C++ and Java languages provide function overloading, which means
that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that
each function takes parameters of different types.  In order to be able
to distinguish these similarly named functions C++ and Java encode them
into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies each
different version.  This process is known as "mangling". The `c++filt'
(1) program does the inverse mapping: it decodes ("demangles") low-level
names into user-level names so that they can be read.

   Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,
dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential mangled name.  If
the name decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-level
name in the output, otherwise the original word is output.  In this way
you can pass an entire assembler source file, containing mangled names,
through `c++filt' and see the same source file containing demangled
names.

   You can also use `c++filt' to decipher individual symbols by passing
them on the command line:

     c++filt SYMBOL

   If no SYMBOL arguments are given, `c++filt' reads symbol names from
the standard input instead.  All the results are printed on the
standard output.  The difference between reading names from the command
line versus reading names from the standard input is that command line
arguments are expected to be just mangled names and no checking is
performed to separate them from surrounding text.  Thus for example:

     c++filt -n _Z1fv

   will work and demangle the name to "f()" whereas:

     c++filt -n _Z1fv,

   will not work.  (Note the extra comma at the end of the mangled name
which makes it invalid).  This command however will work:

     echo _Z1fv, | c++filt -n

   and will display "f(),", i.e., the demangled name followed by a
trailing comma.  This behaviour is because when the names are read from
the standard input it is expected that they might be part of an
assembler source file where there might be extra, extraneous characters
trailing after a mangled name.  For example:

         .type   _Z1fv, @function

`-_'
`--strip-underscore'
     On some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an underscore in
     front of every name.  For example, the C name `foo' gets the
     low-level name `_foo'.  This option removes the initial
     underscore.  Whether `c++filt' removes the underscore by default
     is target dependent.

`-n'
`--no-strip-underscore'
     Do not remove the initial underscore.

`-p'
`--no-params'
     When demangling the name of a function, do not display the types of
     the function's parameters.

`-t'
`--types'
     Attempt to demangle types as well as function names.  This is
     disabled by default since mangled types are normally only used
     internally in the compiler, and they can be confused with
     non-mangled names.  For example, a function called "a" treated as
     a mangled type name would be demangled to "signed char".

`-i'
`--no-verbose'
     Do not include implementation details (if any) in the demangled
     output.

`-s FORMAT'
`--format=FORMAT'
     `c++filt' can decode various methods of mangling, used by
     different compilers.  The argument to this option selects which
     method it uses:

    `auto'
          Automatic selection based on executable (the default method)

    `gnu'
          the one used by the GNU C++ compiler (g++)

    `lucid'
          the one used by the Lucid compiler (lcc)

    `arm'
          the one specified by the C++ Annotated Reference Manual

    `hp'
          the one used by the HP compiler (aCC)

    `edg'
          the one used by the EDG compiler

    `gnu-v3'
          the one used by the GNU C++ compiler (g++) with the V3 ABI.

    `java'
          the one used by the GNU Java compiler (gcj)

    `gnat'
          the one used by the GNU Ada compiler (GNAT).

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `c++filt' and exit.

`--version'
     Print the version number of `c++filt' and exit.

     _Warning:_ `c++filt' is a new utility, and the details of its user
     interface are subject to change in future releases.  In particular,
     a command-line option may be required in the future to decode a
     name passed as an argument on the command line; in other words,

          c++filt SYMBOL

     may in a future release become

          c++filt OPTION SYMBOL

               [addr addr ...]

   `addr2line' translates addresses into file names and line numbers.
Given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a
relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out
which file name and line number are associated with it.

   The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the
`-e' option.  The default is the file `a.out'.  The section in the
relocatable object to use is specified with the `-j' option.

   `addr2line' has two modes of operation.

   In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command
line, and `addr2line' displays the file name and line number for each
address.

   In the second, `addr2line' reads hexadecimal addresses from standard
input, and prints the file name and line number for each address on
standard output.  In this mode, `addr2line' may be used in a pipe to
convert dynamically chosen addresses.

   The format of the output is `FILENAME:LINENO'.  The file name and
line number for each input address is printed on separate lines.

   If the `-f' option is used, then each `FILENAME:LINENO' line is
preceded by `FUNCTIONNAME' which is the name of the function containing
the address.

   If the `-i' option is used and the code at the given address is
present there because of inlining by the compiler then the
`{FUNCTIONNAME} FILENAME:LINENO' information for the inlining function
will be displayed afterwards.  This continues recursively until there
is no more inlining to report.

   If the `-a' option is used then the output is prefixed by the input
address.

   If the `-p' option is used then the output for each input address is
displayed on one, possibly quite long, line.  If `-p' is not used then
the output is broken up into multiple lines, based on the paragraphs
above.

   If the file name or function name can not be determined, `addr2line'
will print two question marks in their place.  If the line number can
not be determined, `addr2line' will print 0.

   The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.

`-a'
`--addresses'
     Display the address before the function name, file and line number
     information.  The address is printed with a `0x' prefix to easily
     identify it.

`-b BFDNAME'
`--target=BFDNAME'
     Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
     BFDNAME.

`-C'
`--demangle[=STYLE]'
     Decode ("demangle") low-level symbol names into user-level names.
     Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system,
     this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
     different mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument
     can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
     compiler. *Note c++filt::, for more information on demangling.

`-e FILENAME'
`--exe=FILENAME'
     Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
     translated.  The default file is `a.out'.

`-f'
`--functions'
     Display function names as well as file and line number information.

`-s'
`--basenames'
     Display only the base of each file name.

`-i'
`--inlines'
     If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source
     information for all enclosing scopes back to the first non-inlined
     function will also be printed.  For example, if `main' inlines
     `callee1' which inlines `callee2', and address is from `callee2',
     the source information for `callee1' and `main' will also be
     printed.

`-j'
`--section'
     Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute
     addresses.

`-p'
`--pretty-print'
     Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on
     one line.  If option `-i' is specified, lines for all enclosing
     scopes are prefixed with `(inlined by)'.

             [`-h'|`--help'] [`-V'|`--version']
             INFILE OUTFILE

   `nlmconv' converts the relocatable `i386' object file INFILE into
the NetWare Loadable Module OUTFILE, optionally reading HEADERFILE for
NLM header information.  For instructions on writing the NLM command
file language used in header files, see the `linkers' section,
`NLMLINK' in particular, of the `NLM Development and Tools Overview',
which is part of the NLM Software Developer's Kit ("NLM SDK"),
available from Novell, Inc.  `nlmconv' uses the GNU Binary File
Descriptor library to read INFILE; see *note BFD: (ld.info)BFD, for
more information.

   `nlmconv' can perform a link step.  In other words, you can list
more than one object file for input if you list them in the definitions
file (rather than simply specifying one input file on the command line).
In this case, `nlmconv' calls the linker for you.

`-I BFDNAME'
`--input-target=BFDNAME'
     Object format of the input file.  `nlmconv' can usually determine
     the format of a given file (so no default is necessary).  *Note
     Target Selection::, for more information.

`-O BFDNAME'
`--output-target=BFDNAME'
     Object format of the output file.  `nlmconv' infers the output
     format based on the input format, e.g. for a `i386' input file the
     output format is `nlm32-i386'.  *Note Target Selection::, for more
     information.

`-T HEADERFILE'
`--header-file=HEADERFILE'
     Reads HEADERFILE for NLM header information.  For instructions on
     writing the NLM command file language used in header files, see

`-d'
`--debug'
     Displays (on standard error) the linker command line used by
     `nlmconv'.

`-l LINKER'
`--linker=LINKER'
     Use LINKER for any linking.  LINKER can be an absolute or a
     relative pathname.

`-h'

`windmc' may be used to generator Windows message resources.

     _Warning:_ `windmc' is not always built as part of the binary
     utilities, since it is only useful for Windows targets.

     windmc [options] input-file

   `windmc' reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and
translate them into a set of output files.  The output files may be of
four kinds:

`h'
     A C header file containing the message definitions.

`rc'
     A resource file compilable by the `windres' tool.

`bin'
     One or more binary files containing the resource data for a
     specific message language.

`dbg'
     A C include file that maps message id's to their symbolic name.

   The exact description of these different formats is available in
documentation from Microsoft.

   When `windmc' converts from the `mc' format to the `bin' format,
`rc', `h', and optional `dbg' it is acting like the Windows Message
Compiler.

`-a'
`--ascii_in'
     Specifies that the input file specified is ASCII. This is the
     default behaviour.

`-A'
`--ascii_out'
     Specifies that messages in the output `bin' files should be in
     ASCII format.

`-b'
`--binprefix'
     Specifies that `bin' filenames should have to be prefixed by the
     basename of the source file.

`-c'
`--customflag'
     Sets the customer bit in all message id's.

`-C CODEPAGE'
`--codepage_in CODEPAGE'
     Sets the default codepage to be used to convert input file to
     UTF16. The default is ocdepage 1252.

`-d'
`--decimal_values'
     Outputs the constants in the header file in decimal. Default is
     using hexadecimal output.

`-e EXT'
`--extension EXT'
     The extension for the header file. The default is .h extension.

`-F TARGET'
`--target TARGET'
     Specify the BFD format to use for a bin file as output.  This is a
     BFD target name; you can use the `--help' option to see a list of
     supported targets.  Normally `windmc' will use the default format,
     which is the first one listed by the `--help' option.  *note
     Target Selection::.

`-h PATH'
`--headerdir PATH'
     The target directory of the generated header file. The default is
     the current directory.

`-H'
`--help'
     Displays a list of command line options and then exits.

`-m CHARACTERS'
`--maxlength CHARACTERS'
     Instructs `windmc' to generate a warning if the length of any
     message exceeds the number specified.

`-n'
`--nullterminate'
     Terminate message text in `bin' files by zero. By default they are
     terminated by CR/LF.

`-o'
`--hresult_use'
     Not yet implemented. Instructs `windmc' to generate an OLE2 header
     file, using HRESULT definitions. Status codes are used if the flag
     is not specified.

`-O CODEPAGE'
`--codepage_out CODEPAGE'
     Sets the default codepage to be used to output text files. The
     default is ocdepage 1252.

`-r PATH'

     The default is the current directory.

`-u'
`--unicode_in'
     Specifies that the input file is UTF16.

`-U'

     Specifies that messages in the output `bin' file should be in UTF16
     format. This is the default behaviour.

`-v'

`--verbose'
     Enable verbose mode.

`-V'

`--version'
     Prints the version number for `windmc'.

`-x PATH'

13 windres
**********

`windres' may be used to manipulate Windows resources.

     _Warning:_ `windres' is not always built as part of the binary
     utilities, since it is only useful for Windows targets.

     windres [options] [input-file] [output-file]

   `windres' reads resources from an input file and copies them into an
output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:

`rc'
     A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

`res'
     A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

`coff'
     A COFF object or executable.

   The exact description of these different formats is available in
documentation from Microsoft.

   When `windres' converts from the `rc' format to the `res' format, it
is acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When `windres' converts
from the `res' format to the `coff' format, it is acting like the
Windows `CVTRES' program.

   When `windres' generates an `rc' file, the output is similar but not
identical to the format expected for the input.  When an input `rc'
file refers to an external filename, an output `rc' file will instead
include the file contents.

   If the input or output format is not specified, `windres' will guess
based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file contents.  A
file with an extension of `.rc' will be treated as an `rc' file, a file
with an extension of `.res' will be treated as a `res' file, and a file
with an extension of `.o' or `.exe' will be treated as a `coff' file.

   If no output file is specified, `windres' will print the resources
in `rc' format to standard output.

   The normal use is for you to write an `rc' file, use `windres' to
convert it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file into your
application.  This will make the resources described in the `rc' file
available to Windows.

`-i FILENAME'
`--input FILENAME'
     The name of the input file.  If this option is not used, then
     `windres' will use the first non-option argument as the input file
     name.  If there are no non-option arguments, then `windres' will
     read from standard input.  `windres' can not read a COFF file from
     standard input.

`-o FILENAME'
`--output FILENAME'
     The name of the output file.  If this option is not used, then
     `windres' will use the first non-option argument, after any used
     for the input file name, as the output file name.  If there is no
     non-option argument, then `windres' will write to standard output.
     `windres' can not write a COFF file to standard output.  Note, for
     compatibility with `rc' the option `-fo' is also accepted, but its
     use is not recommended.

`-J FORMAT'
`--input-format FORMAT'
     The input format to read.  FORMAT may be `res', `rc', or `coff'.
     If no input format is specified, `windres' will guess, as
     described above.

`-O FORMAT'
`--output-format FORMAT'
     The output format to generate.  FORMAT may be `res', `rc', or
     `coff'.  If no output format is specified, `windres' will guess,
     as described above.

`-F TARGET'
`--target TARGET'
     Specify the BFD format to use for a COFF file as input or output.
     This is a BFD target name; you can use the `--help' option to see
     a list of supported targets.  Normally `windres' will use the
     default format, which is the first one listed by the `--help'
     option.  *note Target Selection::.

`--preprocessor PROGRAM'
     When `windres' reads an `rc' file, it runs it through the C
     preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify the
     preprocessor to use, including any leading arguments.  The default
     preprocessor argument is `gcc -E -xc-header -DRC_INVOKED'.

`--preprocessor-arg OPTION'
     When `windres' reads an `rc' file, it runs it through the C
     preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify additional
     text to be passed to preprocessor on its command line.  This
     option can be used multiple times to add multiple options to the
     preprocessor command line.

`-I DIRECTORY'
`--include-dir DIRECTORY'
     Specify an include directory to use when reading an `rc' file.
     `windres' will pass this to the preprocessor as an `-I' option.
     `windres' will also search this directory when looking for files
     named in the `rc' file.  If the argument passed to this command
     matches any of the supported FORMATS (as described in the `-J'
     oPK
     cO
      	   1/1.z2193ption), it will issue a deprecation warning, and behave just like
     the `-J' option.  New programs should not use this behaviour.  If a
     directory happens to match a FORMAT, simple prefix it with `./' to
     disable the backward compatibility.

`-D TARGET'
`--define SYM[=VAL]'
     Specify a `-D' option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an
     `rc' file.

`-U TARGET'
`--undefine SYM'
     Specify a `-U' option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an
     `rc' file.

`-r'
     Ignored for compatibility with rc.

`-v'
     Enable verbose mode.  This tells you what the preprocessor is if
     you didn't specify one.

`-c VAL'

`--codepage VAL'
     Specify the default codepage to use when reading an `rc' file.
     VAL should be a hexadecimal prefixed by `0x' or decimal codepage
     code. The valid range is from zero up to 0xffff, but the validity
     of the codepage is host and configuration dependent.

`-l VAL'

`--language VAL'
     Specify the default language to use when reading an `rc' file.
     VAL should be a hexadecimal language code.  The low eight bits are
     the language, and the high eight bits are the sublanguage.

`--use-temp-file'
     Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read the output
     of the preprocessor. Use this option if the popen implementation
     is buggy on the host (eg., certain non-English language versions
     of Windows 95 and Windows 98 are known to have buggy popen where
     the output will instead go the console).

`--no-use-temp-file'
     Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of the
     preprocessor.  This is the default behaviour.

`-h'

`--help'
     Prints a usage summary.

`-V'

`--version'
     Prints the version number for `windres'.

`--yydebug'
     If `windres' is compiled with `YYDEBUG' defined as `1', this will
     turn on parser debugging.

14 dlltool
**********

`dlltool' is used to create the files needed to create dynamic link
libraries (DLLs) on systems which understand PE format image files such
as Windows.  A DLL contains an export table which contains information
that the runtime loader needs to resolve references from a referencing
program.

   The export table is generated by this program by reading in a `.def'
file or scanning the `.a' and `.o' files which will be in the DLL.  A
`.o' file can contain information in special `.drectve' sections with
export information.

     _Note:_ `dlltool' is not always built as part of the binary
     utilities, since it is only useful for those targets which support
     DLLs.

             [`--no-leading-underscore'] [`--leading-underscore']
             [object-file ...]

   `dlltool' reads its inputs, which can come from the `-d' and `-b'
options as well as object files specified on the command line.  It then
processes these inputs and if the `-e' option has been specified it
creates a exports file.  If the `-l' option has been specified it
creates a library file and if the `-z' option has been specified it
creates a def file.  Any or all of the `-e', `-l' and `-z' options can
be present in one invocation of dlltool.

   When creating a DLL, along with the source for the DLL, it is
necessary to have three other files.  `dlltool' can help with the
creation of these files.

   The first file is a `.def' file which specifies which functions are
exported from the DLL, which functions the DLL imports, and so on.  This
is a text file and can be created by hand, or `dlltool' can be used to
create it using the `-z' option.  In this case `dlltool' will scan the
object files specified on its command line looking for those functions
which have been specially marked as being exported and put entries for
them in the `.def' file it creates.

   In order to mark a function as being exported from a DLL, it needs to
have an `-export:<name_of_function>' entry in the `.drectve' section of
the object file.  This can be done in C by using the asm() operator:

       asm (".section .drectve");
       asm (".ascii \"-export:my_func\"");

       int my_func (void) { ... }

   The second file needed for DLL creation is an exports file.  This
file is linked with the object files that make up the body of the DLL
and it handles the interface between the DLL and the outside world.
This is a binary file and it can be created by giving the `-e' option to
`dlltool' when it is creating or reading in a `.def' file.

   The third file needed for DLL creation is the library file that
programs will link with in order to access the functions in the DLL (an
`import library').  This file can be created by giving the `-l' option
to dlltool when it is creating or reading in a `.def' file.

   If the `-y' option is specified, dlltool generates a delay-import
library that can be used instead of the normal import library to allow
a program to link to the dll only as soon as an imported function is
called for the first time. The resulting executable will need to be
linked to the static delayimp library containing __delayLoadHelper2(),
which in turn will import LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress from kernel32.

   `dlltool' builds the library file by hand, but it builds the exports
file by creating temporary files containing assembler statements and
then assembling these.  The `-S' command line option can be used to
specify the path to the assembler that dlltool will use, and the `-f'
option can be used to pass specific flags to that assembler.  The `-n'
can be used to prevent dlltool from deleting these temporary assembler
files when it is done, and if `-n' is specified twice then this will
prevent dlltool from deleting the temporary object files it used to
build the library.

   Here is an example of creating a DLL from a source file `dll.c' and
also creating a program (from an object file called `program.o') that
uses that DLL:

       gcc -c dll.c
       dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o
       gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll
       gcc program.o dll.lib -o program

   `dlltool' may also be used to query an existing import library to
determine the name of the DLL to which it is associated.  See the
description of the `-I' or `--identify' option.

   The command line options have the following meanings:

`-d FILENAME'
`--input-def FILENAME'
     Specifies the name of a `.def' file to be read in and processed.

`-b FILENAME'
`--base-file FILENAME'
     Specifies the name of a base file to be read in and processed.  The
     contents of this file will be added to the relocation section in
     the exports file generated by dlltool.

`-e FILENAME'
`--output-exp FILENAME'
     Specifies the name of the export file to be created by dlltool.

`-z FILENAME'
`--output-def FILENAME'
     Specifies the name of the `.def' file to be created by dlltool.

`-l FILENAME'
`--output-lib FILENAME'
     Specifies the name of the library file to be created by dlltool.

`-y FILENAME'
`--output-delaylib FILENAME'
     Specifies the name of the delay-import library file to be created
     by dlltool.

`--export-all-symbols'
     Treat all global and weak defined symbols found in the input object
     files as symbols to be exported.  There is a small list of symbols
     which are not exported by default; see the `--no-default-excludes'
     option.  You may add to the list of symbols to not export by using
     the `--exclude-symbols' option.

`--no-export-all-symbols'
     Only export symbols explicitly listed in an input `.def' file or in
     `.drectve' sections in the input object files.  This is the default
     behaviour.  The `.drectve' sections are created by `dllexport'
     attributes in the source code.

`--exclude-symbols LIST'
     Do not export the symbols in LIST.  This is a list of symbol names
     separated by comma or colon characters.  The symbol names should
     not contain a leading underscore.  This is only meaningful when
     `--export-all-symbols' is used.

`--no-default-excludes'
     When `--export-all-symbols' is used, it will by default avoid
     exporting certain special symbols.  The current list of symbols to
     avoid exporting is `DllMain@12', `DllEntryPoint@0', `impure_ptr'.
     You may use the `--no-default-excludes' option to go ahead and
     export these special symbols.  This is only meaningful when
     `--export-all-symbols' is used.

`-S PATH'
`--as PATH'
     Specifies the path, including the filename, of the assembler to be
     used to create the exports file.

`-f OPTIONS'
`--as-flags OPTIONS'
     Specifies any specific command line options to be passed to the
     assembler when building the exports file.  This option will work
     even if the `-S' option is not used.  This option only takes one
     argument, and if it occurs more than once on the command line,
     then later occurrences will override earlier occurrences.  So if
     it is necessary to pass multiple options to the assembler they
     should be enclosed in double quotes.

`-D NAME'
`--dll-name NAME'
     Specifies the name to be stored in the `.def' file as the name of
     the DLL when the `-e' option is used.  If this option is not
     present, then the filename given to the `-e' option will be used
     as the name of the DLL.

`-m MACHINE'
`-machine MACHINE'
     Specifies the type of machine for which the library file should be
     built.  `dlltool' has a built in default type, depending upon how
     it was created, but this option can be used to override that.
     This is normally only useful when creating DLLs for an ARM
     processor, when the contents of the DLL are actually encode using
     Thumb instructions.

`-a'
`--add-indirect'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports file it
     should add a section which allows the exported functions to be
     referenced without using the import library.  Whatever the hell
     that means!

`-U'
`--add-underscore'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports file it
     should prepend an underscore to the names of _all_ exported
     symbols.

`--no-leading-underscore'

`--leading-underscore'
     Specifies whether standard symbol should be forced to be prefixed,
     or not.

`--add-stdcall-underscore'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports file it
     should prepend an underscore to the names of exported _stdcall_
     functions. Variable names and non-stdcall function names are not
     modified.  This option is useful when creating GNU-compatible
     import libs for third party DLLs that were built with MS-Windows
     tools.

`-k'
`--kill-at'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports file it
     should not append the string `@ <number>'.  These numbers are
     called ordinal numbers and they represent another way of accessing
     the function in a DLL, other than by name.

`-A'
`--add-stdcall-alias'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports file it
     should add aliases for stdcall symbols without `@ <number>' in
     addition to the symbols with `@ <number>'.

`-p'
`--ext-prefix-alias PREFIX'
     Causes `dlltool' to create external aliases for all DLL imports
     with the specified prefix.  The aliases are created for both
     external and import symbols with no leading underscore.

`-x'
`--no-idata4'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports and library
     files it should omit the `.idata4' section.  This is for
     compatibility with certain operating systems.

`--use-nul-prefixed-import-tables'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports and library
     files it should prefix the `.idata4' and `.idata5' by zero an
     element. This emulates old gnu import library generation of
     `dlltool'. By default this option is turned off.

`-c'
`--no-idata5'
     Specifies that when `dlltool' is creating the exports and library
     files it should omit the `.idata5' section.  This is for
     compatibility with certain operating systems.

`-I FILENAME'
`--identify FILENAME'
     Specifies that `dlltool' should inspect the import library
     indicated by FILENAME and report, on `stdout', the name(s) of the
     associated DLL(s).  This can be performed in addition to any other
     operations indicated by the other options and arguments.
     `dlltool' fails if the import library does not exist or is not
     actually an import library. See also `--identify-strict'.

`--identify-strict'
     Modifies the behavior of the `--identify' option, such that an
     error is reported if FILENAME is associated with more than one DLL.

`-i'
`--interwork'
     Specifies that `dlltool' should mark the objects in the library
     file and exports file that it produces as supporting interworking
     between ARM and Thumb code.

`-n'
`--nodelete'
     Makes `dlltool' preserve the temporary assembler files it used to
     create the exports file.  If this option is repeated then dlltool
     will also preserve the temporary object files it uses to create
     the library file.

`-t PREFIX'
`--temp-prefix PREFIX'
     Makes `dlltool' use PREFIX when constructing the names of
     temporary assembler and object files.  By default, the temp file
     prefix is generated from the pid.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Make dlltool describe what it is doing.

`-h'
`--help'
     Displays a list of command line options and then exits.

`-V'
`--version'
     Displays dlltool's version number and then exits.

14.1 The format of the `dlltool' `.def' file
============================================

A `.def' file contains any number of the following commands:

`NAME' NAME `[ ,' BASE `]'
     The result is going to be named NAME`.exe'.

`LIBRARY' NAME `[ ,' BASE `]'
     The result is going to be named NAME`.dll'.  Note: If you want to
     use LIBRARY as name then you need to quote.  Otherwise this will
     fail due a necessary hack for libtool (see PR binutils/13710 for
     more details).

`EXPORTS ( ( (' NAME1 `[ = ' NAME2 `] ) | ( ' NAME1 `=' MODULE-NAME `.' EXTERNAL-NAME `) ) [ == ' ITS_NAME `]'

`[' INTEGER `] [ NONAME ] [ CONSTANT ] [ DATA ] [ PRIVATE ] ) *'
     Declares NAME1 as an exported symbol from the DLL, with optional
     ordinal number INTEGER, or declares NAME1 as an alias (forward) of
     the function EXTERNAL-NAME in the DLL.  If ITS_NAME is specified,
     this name is used as string in export table.  MODULE-NAME.  Note:
     The `EXPORTS' has to be the last command in .def file, as keywords
     are treated - beside `LIBRARY' - as simple name-identifiers.  If
     you want to use LIBRARY as name then you need to quote it.

`IMPORTS ( (' INTERNAL-NAME `=' MODULE-NAME `.' INTEGER `) | [' INTERNAL-NAME `= ]' MODULE-NAME `.' EXTERNAL-NAME `) [ == ) ITS_NAME `]' *'
     Declares that EXTERNAL-NAME or the exported function whose ordinal
     number is INTEGER is to be imported from the file MODULE-NAME.  If
     INTERNAL-NAME is specified then this is the name that the imported
     function will be referred to in the body of the DLL.  If ITS_NAME
     is specified, this name is used as string in import table.  Note:
     The `IMPORTS' has to be the last command in .def file, as keywords
     are treated - beside `LIBRARY' - as simple name-identifiers.  If
     you want to use LIBRARY as name then you need to quote it.

`DESCRIPTION' STRING
     Puts STRING into the output `.exp' file in the `.rdata' section.

`STACKSIZE' NUMBER-RESERVE `[, ' NUMBER-COMMIT `]'

`HEAPSIZE' NUMBER-RESERVE `[, ' NUMBER-COMMIT `]'
     Generates `--stack' or `--heap' NUMBER-RESERVE,NUMBER-COMMIT in
     the output `.drectve' section.  The linker will see this and act
     upon it.

`CODE' ATTR `+'

`DATA' ATTR `+'

`SECTIONS (' SECTION-NAME ATTR` + ) *'
     Generates `--attr' SECTION-NAME ATTR in the output `.drectve'
     section, where ATTR is one of `READ', `WRITE', `EXECUTE' or
     `SHARED'.  The linker will see this and act upon it.

             ELFFILE...

   `readelf' displays information about one or more ELF format object
files.  The options control what particular information to display.

   ELFFILE... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and 64-bit
ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.

   This program performs a similar function to `objdump' but it goes
into more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library, so if
there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.

   The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.  At least one option besides `-v' or `-H' must be given.

`-a'
`--all'
     Equivalent to specifying `--file-header', `--program-headers',
     `--sections', `--symbols', `--relocs', `--dynamic', `--notes' and
     `--version-info'.

`-h'
`--file-header'
     Displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start
     of the file.

`-l'
`--program-headers'
`--segments'
     Displays the information contained in the file's segment headers,
     if it has any.

`-S'
`--sections'
`--section-headers'
     Displays the information contained in the file's section headers,
     if it has any.

`-g'
`--section-groups'
     Displays the information contained in the file's section groups,
     if it has any.

`-t'
`--section-details'
     Displays the detailed section information. Implies `-S'.

`-s'
`--symbols'
`--syms'
     Displays the entries in symbol table section of the file, if it
     has one.

`--dyn-syms'
     Displays the entries in dynamic symbol table section of the file,
     if it has one.

`-e'
`--headers'
     Display all the headers in the file.  Equivalent to `-h -l -S'.

`-n'
`--notes'
     Displays the contents of the NOTE segments and/or sections, if any.

`-r'
`--relocs'
     Displays the contents of the file's relocation section, if it has
     one.

`-u'
`--unwind'
     Displays the contents of the file's unwind section, if it has one.
     Only the unwind sections for IA64 ELF files, as well as ARM unwind
     tables (`.ARM.exidx' / `.ARM.extab') are currently supported.

`-d'
`--dynamic'
     Displays the contents of the file's dynamic section, if it has one.

`-V'
`--version-info'
     Displays the contents of the version sections in the file, it they
     exist.

`-A'
`--arch-specific'
     Displays architecture-specific information in the file, if there
     is any.

`-D'
`--use-dynamic'
     When displaying symbols, this option makes `readelf' use the
     symbol hash tables in the file's dynamic section, rather than the
     symbol table sections.

`-x <number or name>'
`--hex-dump=<number or name>'
     Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal
     bytes.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the
     section table; any other string identifies all sections with that
     name in the object file.

`-R <number or name>'
`--relocated-dump=<number or name>'
     Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal
     bytes.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the
     section table; any other string identifies all sections with that
     name in the object file.  The contents of the section will be
     relocated before they are displayed.

`-p <number or name>'
`--string-dump=<number or name>'
     Displays the contents of the indicated section as printable
     strings.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the
     section table; any other string identifies all sections with that
     name in the object file.

`-c'
`--archive-index'
     Displays the file symbol index information contained in the header
     part of binary archives.  Performs the same function as the `t'
     command to `ar', but without using the BFD library.  *Note ar::.

`-w[lLiaprmfFsoRt]'
`--debug-dump[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges,=pubtypes,=trace_info,=trace_abbrev,=trace_aranges,=gdb_index]'
     Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are
     present.  If one of the optional letters or words follows the
     switch then only data found in those specific sections will be
     dumped.

     Note that there is no single letter option to display the content
     of trace sections or .gdb_index.

     Note: the `=decodedline' option will display the interpreted
     contents of a .debug_line section whereas the `=rawline' option
     dumps the contents in a raw format.

     Note: the `=frames-interp' option will display the interpreted
     contents of a .debug_frame section whereas the `=frames' option
     dumps the contents in a raw format.

     Note: the output from the `=info' option can also be affected by
     the options `--dwarf-depth' and `--dwarf-start'.

`--dwarf-depth=N'
     Limit the dump of the `.debug_info' section to N children.  This
     is only useful with `--debug-dump=info'.  The default is to print
     all DIEs; the special value 0 for N will also have this effect.

     With a non-zero value for N, DIEs at or deeper than N levels will
     not be printed.  The range for N is zero-based.

`--dwarf-start=N'
     Print only DIEs beginning with the DIE numbered N.  This is only
     useful with `--debug-dump=info'.

     If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header
     information and all DIEs before the DIE numbered N.  Only siblings
     and children of the specified DIE will be printed.

     This can be used in conjunction with `--dwarf-depth'.

`-I'
`--histogram'
     Display a histogram of bucket list lengths when displaying the
     contents of the symbol tables.

`-v'
`--version'
     Display the version number of readelf.

`-W'
`--wide'
     Don't break output lines to fit into 80 columns. By default
     `readelf' breaks section header and segment listing lines for
     64-bit ELF files, so that they fit into 80 columns. This option
     causes `readelf' to print each section header resp. each segment
     one a single line, which is far more readable on terminals wider
     than 80 columns.

`-H'
`--help'
     Display the command line options understood by `readelf'.

17 Common Options
*****************

The following command-line options are supported by all of the programs
described in this manual.

`@FILE'
     Read command-line options from FILE.  The options read are
     inserted in place of the original @FILE option.  If FILE does not
     exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
     literally, and not removed.

     Options in FILE are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
     character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
     option in either single or double quotes.  Any character
     (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character
     to be included with a backslash.  The FILE may itself contain
     additional @FILE options; any such options will be processed
     recursively.

`--help'
     Display the command-line options supported by the program.

`--version'
     Display the version number of the program.

18 Selecting the Target System
******************************

You can specify two aspects of the target system to the GNU binary file
utilities, each in several ways:

   * the target

   * the architecture

   In the following summaries, the lists of ways to specify values are
in order of decreasing precedence.  The ways listed first override those
listed later.

   The commands to list valid values only list the values for which the
programs you are running were configured.  If they were configured with
`--enable-targets=all', the commands list most of the available values,
but a few are left out; not all targets can be configured in at once
because some of them can only be configured "native" (on hosts with the
same type as the target system).

* Menu:

* Target Selection::
* Architecture Selection::


File: binutils.info,  Node: Target Selection,  Next: Architecture Selection,  Up: Selecting the Target System

18.1 Target Selection
=====================

A "target" is an object file format.  A given target may be supported
for multiple architectures (*note Architecture Selection::).  A target
selection may also have variations for different operating systems or
architectures.

   The command to list valid target values is `objdump -i' (the first
column of output contains the relevant information).

   Some sample values are: `a.out-hp300bsd', `ecoff-littlemips',
`a.out-sunos-big'.

   You can also specify a target using a configuration triplet.  This is
the same sort of name that is passed to `configure' to specify a
target.  When you use a configuration triplet as an argument, it must be
fully canonicalized.  You can see the canonical version of a triplet by
running the shell script `config.sub' which is included with the
sources.

   Some sample configuration triplets are: `m68k-hp-bsd',
`mips-dec-ultrix', `sparc-sun-sunos'.

`objdump' Target
----------------

Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-b' or `--target'

  2. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  3. deduced from the input file

`objcopy' and `strip' Input Target
----------------------------------

Ways to specify:

  1. command line options: `-I' or `--input-target', or `-F' or
     `--target'

  2. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  3. deduced from the input file

`objcopy' and `strip' Output Target
-----------------------------------

Ways to specify:

  1. command line options: `-O' or `--output-target', or `-F' or
     `--target'

  2. the input target (see "`objcopy' and `strip' Input Target" above)

  3. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  4. deduced from the input file

`nm', `size', and `strings' Target
----------------------------------

Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `--target'

  2. environment variable `GNUTARGET'

  3. deduced from the input file


File: binutils.info,  Node: Architecture Selection,  Prev: Target Selection,  Up: Selecting the Target System

18.2 Architecture Selection
===========================

An "architecture" is a type of CPU on which an object file is to run.
Its name may contain a colon, separating the name of the processor
family from the name of the particular CPU.

   The command to list valid architecture values is `objdump -i' (the
second column contains the relevant information).

   Sample values: `m68k:68020', `mips:3000', `sparc'.

`objdump' Architecture
----------------------

Ways to specify:

  1. command line option: `-m' or `--architecture'

  2. deduced from the input file

`objcopy', `nm', `size', `strings' Architecture

19 Reporting Bugs
*****************

Your bug reports play an essential role in making the binary utilities
reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of the binary
utilities work better.  Bug reports are your contribution to their
maintenance.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::                Have you found a bug?
* Bug Reporting::               How to report bugs


File: binutils.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Reporting Bugs

19.1 Have You Found a Bug?
==========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If a binary utility gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever,
     that is a bug.  Reliable utilities never crash.

   * If a binary utility produces an error message for valid input,
     that is a bug.

   * If you are an experienced user of binary utilities, your
     suggestions for improvement are welcome in any case.


File: binutils.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Prev: Bug Criteria,  Up: Reporting Bugs

19.2 How to Report Bugs
=======================

A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained the binary utilities from a support organization, we
recommend you contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for the
binary utilities to `http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a file you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is
a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where
that pathname is stored in memory; perhaps, if the pathname were
different, the contents of that location would fool the utility into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.  You
might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of the utility.  Each utility announces it if you
     start it with the `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of the binary utilities.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the source, including any
     patches made to the `BFD' library.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile the
     utilities--e.g.  "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the utility to observe the bug.  To
     guarantee you will not omit something important, list them all.  A
     copy of the Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file, or set of input files, that will reproduce
     the bug.  If the utility is reading an object file or files, then
     it is generally most helpful to send the actual object files.

     If the source files were produced exclusively using GNU programs
     (e.g., `gcc', `gas', and/or the GNU `ld'), then it may be OK to
     send the source files rather than the object files.  In this case,
     be sure to say exactly what version of `gcc', or whatever, was
     used to produce the object files.  Also say how `gcc', or
     whatever, was configured.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that the utility gets a fatal signal,
     then we will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect
     output, we might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You
     might as well not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as your copy of the utility is out of sync, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has
     happened!)  Your copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told
     us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know
     that the bug was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to
     expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion
     from our observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you wish
     to discuss something in the `ld' source, refer to it by context,
     not by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with programs as complicated as the binary utilities it
     is very hard to construct an example that will make the program
     follow a certain path through the code.  If you do not send us the
     example, we will not be able to construct one, so we will not be
     able to verify that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

1 Introduction
**************

This document describes the GNU configure and build systems.  It
describes how autoconf, automake, libtool, and make fit together.  It
also includes a discussion of the older Cygnus configure system.

   This document does not describe in detail how to use each of the
tools; see the respective manuals for that.  Instead, it describes which
files the developer must write, which files are machine generated and
how they are generated, and where certain common problems should be
addressed.

   This document draws on several sources, including the autoconf manual
by David MacKenzie (*note autoconf overview: (autoconf)Top.), the
automake manual by David MacKenzie and Tom Tromey (*note automake
overview: (automake)Top.), the libtool manual by Gordon Matzigkeit
(*note libtool overview: (libtool)Top.), and the Cygnus configure manual
by K. Richard Pixley.

1.1 Goals
=========

The GNU configure and build system has two main goals.

   The first is to simplify the development of portable programs.  The
system permits the developer to concentrate on writing the program,
simplifying many details of portability across Unix and even Windows
systems, and permitting the developer to describe how to build the
program using simple rules rather than complex Makefiles.

   The second is to simplify the building of programs distributed as
source code.  All programs are built using a simple, standardized, two
step process.  The program builder need not install any special tools in
order to build the program.


File: configure.info,  Node: Tools,  Next: History,  Prev: Goals,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Tools
=========

The GNU configure and build system is comprised of several different
tools.  Program developers must build and install all of these tools.

   People who just want to build programs from distributed sources
normally do not need any special tools beyond a Unix shell, a make
program, and a C compiler.

autoconf
     provides a general portability framework, based on testing the
     features of the host system at build time.
automake
     a system for describing how to build a program, permitting the
     developer to write a simplified 'Makefile'.
libtool
     a standardized approach to building shared libraries.
gettext
     provides a framework for translation of text messages into other
     languages; not really discussed in this document.
m4
     autoconf requires the GNU version of m4; the standard Unix m4 does
     not suffice.
perl
     automake requires perl.


File: configure.info,  Node: History,  Next: Building,  Prev: Tools,  Up: Introduction

1.3 History
===========

This is a very brief and probably inaccurate history.

   As the number of Unix variants increased during the 1980s, it became
harder to write programs which could run on all variants.  While it was
often possible to use '#ifdef' to identify particular systems,
developers frequently did not have access to every system, and the
characteristics of some systems changed from version to version.

   By 1992, at least three different approaches had been developed:
   * The Metaconfig program, by Larry Wall, Harlan Stenn, and Raphael
     Manfredi.
   * The Cygnus configure script, by K. Richard Pixley, and the gcc
     configure script, by Richard Stallman.  These use essentially the
     same approach, and the developers communicated regularly.
   * The autoconf program, by David MacKenzie.

   The Metaconfig program is still used for Perl and a few other
programs.  It is part of the Dist package.  I do not know if it is being
developed.

   In 1994, David MacKenzie and others modified autoconf to incorporate
all the features of Cygnus configure.  Since then, there has been a slow
but steady conversion of GNU programs from Cygnus configure to autoconf.
gcc has been converted, eliminating the gcc configure script.

   GNU autoconf was regularly maintained until late 1996.  As of this
writing in June, 1998, it has no public maintainer.

   Most programs are built using the make program, which requires the
developer to write Makefiles describing how to build the programs.
Since most programs are built in pretty much the same way, this led to a
lot of duplication.

   The X Window system is built using the imake tool, which uses a
database of rules to eliminate the duplication.  However, building a
tool which was developed using imake requires that the builder have
imake installed, violating one of the goals of the GNU system.

   The new BSD make provides a standard library of Makefile fragments,
which permits developers to write very simple Makefiles.  However, this
requires that the builder install the new BSD make program.

   In 1994, David MacKenzie wrote the first version of automake, which
permitted writing a simple build description which was converted into a
Makefile which could be used by the standard make program.  In 1995, Tom
Tromey completely rewrote automake in Perl, and he continues to enhance
it.

   Various free packages built libraries, and by around 1995 several
included support to build shared libraries on various platforms.
However, there was no consistent approach.  In early 1996, Gordon
Matzigkeit began working on libtool, which provided a standardized
approach to building shared libraries.  This was integrated into
automake from the start.

   The development of automake and libtool was driven by the GNITS
project, a group of GNU maintainers who designed standardized tools to
help meet the GNU coding standards.

1.4 Building
============

Most readers of this document should already know how to build a tool by
running 'configure' and 'make'.  This section may serve as a quick
introduction or reminder.

   Building a tool is normally as simple as running 'configure' followed
by 'make'.  You should normally run 'configure' from an empty directory,
using some path to refer to the 'configure' script in the source
directory.  The directory in which you run 'configure' is called the
"object directory".

   In order to use a object directory which is different from the source
directory, you must be using the GNU version of 'make', which has the
required 'VPATH' support.  Despite this restriction, using a different
object directory is highly recommended:
   * It keeps the files generated during the build from cluttering up
     your sources.
   * It permits you to remove the built files by simply removing the
     entire build directory.
   * It permits you to build from the same sources with several sets of
     configure options simultaneously.

   If you don't have GNU 'make', you will have to run 'configure' in the
source directory.  All GNU packages should support this; in particular,
GNU packages should not assume the presence of GNU 'make'.

   After running 'configure', you can build the tools by running 'make'.

   To install the tools, run 'make install'.  Installing the tools will
copy the programs and any required support files to the "installation
directory".  The location of the installation directory is controlled by
'configure' options, as described below.

   In the Cygnus tree at present, the info files are built and installed
as a separate step.  To build them, run 'make info'.  To install them,
run 'make install-info'.  The equivalent html files are also built and
installed in a separate step.  To build the html files, run 'make html'.
To install the html files run 'make install-html'.

   All 'configure' scripts support a wide variety of options.  The most
interesting ones are '--with' and '--enable' options which are generally
specific to particular tools.  You can usually use the '--help' option
to get a list of interesting options for a particular configure script.

   The only generic options you are likely to use are the '--prefix' and
'--exec-prefix' options.  These options are used to specify the
installation directory.

   The directory named by the '--prefix' option will hold machine
independent files such as info files.

   The directory named by the '--exec-prefix' option, which is normally
a subdirectory of the '--prefix' directory, will hold machine dependent
files such as executables.

   The default for '--prefix' is '/usr/local'.  The default for
'--exec-prefix' is the value used for '--prefix'.

   The convention used in Cygnus releases is to use a '--prefix' option
of '/usr/cygnus/RELEASE', where RELEASE is the name of the release, and
to use a '--exec-prefix' option of '/usr/cygnus/RELEASE/H-HOST', where
HOST is the configuration name of the host system (*note Configuration
Names::).

   Do not use either the source or the object directory as the
installation directory.  That will just lead to confusion.

2 Getting Started
*****************

To start using the GNU configure and build system with your software
package, you must write three files, and you must run some tools to
manually generate additional files.

* Menu:

* Write configure.in::		Write configure.in.
* Write Makefile.am::		Write Makefile.am.
* Write acconfig.h::		Write acconfig.h.
* Generate files::		Generate files.
* Getting Started Example::	Example.


File: configure.info,  Node: Write configure.in,  Next: Write Makefile.am,  Up: Getting Started

2.1 Write configure.in
======================

You must first write the file 'configure.in'.  This is an autoconf input
file, and the autoconf manual describes in detail what this file should
look like.

   You will write tests in your 'configure.in' file to check for
conditions that may change from one system to another, such as the
presence of particular header files or functions.

   For example, not all systems support the 'gettimeofday' function.  If
you want to use the 'gettimeofday' function when it is available, and to
use some other function when it is not, you would check for this by
putting 'AC_CHECK_FUNCS(gettimeofday)' in 'configure.in'.

   When the configure script is run at build time, this will arrange to
define the preprocessor macro 'HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY' to the value 1 if the
'gettimeofday' function is available, and to not define the macro at all
if the function is not available.  Your code can then use '#ifdef' to
test whether it is safe to call 'gettimeofday'.

   If you have an existing body of code, the 'autoscan' program may help
identify potential portability problems, and hence configure tests that
you will want to use.  *Note (autoconf)Invoking autoscan::.

   Another handy tool for an existing body of code is 'ifnames'.  This
will show you all the preprocessor conditionals that the code already
uses.  *Note (autoconf)Invoking ifnames::.

   Besides the portability tests which are specific to your particular
package, every 'configure.in' file should contain the following macros.

'AC_INIT'
     This macro takes a single argument, which is the name of a file in
     your package.  For example, 'AC_INIT(foo.c)'.

'AC_PREREQ(VERSION)'
     This macro is optional.  It may be used to indicate the version of
     'autoconf' that you are using.  This will prevent users from
     running an earlier version of 'autoconf' and perhaps getting an
     invalid 'configure' script.  For example, 'AC_PREREQ(2.12)'.

'AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE'
     This macro takes two arguments: the name of the package, and a
     version number.  For example, 'AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(foo, 1.0)'.  (This
     macro is not needed if you are not using automake).

'AM_CONFIG_HEADER'
     This macro names the header file which will hold the preprocessor
     macro definitions at run time.  Normally this should be 'config.h'.
     Your sources would then use '#include "config.h"' to include it.

     This macro may optionally name the input file for that header file;
     by default, this is 'config.h.in', but that file name works poorly
     on DOS filesystems.  Therefore, it is often better to name it
     explicitly as 'config.in'.

     This is what you should normally put in 'configure.in':
          AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h:config.in)

     (If you are not using automake, use 'AC_CONFIG_HEADER' rather than
     'AM_CONFIG_HEADER').

'AM_MAINTAINER_MODE'
     This macro always appears in Cygnus configure scripts.  Other
     programs may or may not use it.

     If this macro is used, the '--enable-maintainer-mode' option is
     required to enable automatic rebuilding of generated files used by
     the configure system.  This of course requires that developers be
     aware of, and use, that option.

     If this macro is not used, then the generated files will always be
     rebuilt automatically.  This will cause problems if the wrong
     versions of autoconf, automake, or others are in the builder's
     'PATH'.

     (If you are not using automake, you do not need to use this macro).

'AC_EXEEXT'
     Either this macro or 'AM_EXEEXT' always appears in Cygnus configure
     files.  Other programs may or may not use one of them.

     This macro looks for the executable suffix used on the host system.
     On Unix systems, this is the empty string.  On Windows systems,
     this is '.exe'.  This macro directs automake to use the executable
     suffix as appropriate when creating programs.  This macro does not
     take any arguments.

     The 'AC_EXEEXT' form is new, and is part of a Cygnus patch to
     autoconf to support compiling with Visual C++.  Older programs use
     'AM_EXEEXT' instead.

     (Programs which do not use automake use neither 'AC_EXEEXT' nor
     'AM_EXEEXT').

'AC_PROG_CC'
     If you are writing C code, you will normally want to use this
     macro.  It locates the C compiler to use.  It does not take any
     arguments.

     However, if this 'configure.in' file is for a library which is to
     be compiled by a cross compiler which may not fully work, then you
     will not want to use 'AC_PROG_CC'.  Instead, you will want to use a
     variant which does not call the macro 'AC_PROG_CC_WORKS'.  Examples
     can be found in various 'configure.in' files for libraries that are
     compiled with cross compilers, such as libiberty or libgloss.  This
     is essentially a bug in autoconf, and there will probably be a
     better workaround at some point.

'AC_PROG_CXX'
     If you are writing C++ code, you will want to use this macro.  It
     locates the C++ compiler to use.  It does not take any arguments.
     The same cross compiler comments apply as for 'AC_PROG_CC'.

'AM_PROG_LIBTOOL'
     If you want to build libraries, and you want to permit them to be
     shared, or you want to link against libraries which were built
     using libtool, then you will need this macro.  This macro is
     required in order to use libtool.

     By default, this will cause all libraries to be built as shared
     libraries.  To prevent this-to change the default-use
     'AM_DISABLE_SHARED' before 'AM_PROG_LIBTOOL'.  The configure
     options '--enable-shared' and '--disable-shared' may be used to
     override the default at build time.

'AC_DEFINE(_GNU_SOURCE)'
     GNU packages should normally include this line before any other
     feature tests.  This defines the macro '_GNU_SOURCE' when
     compiling, which directs the libc header files to provide the
     standard GNU system interfaces including all GNU extensions.  If
     this macro is not defined, certain GNU extensions may not be
     available.

'AC_OUTPUT'
     This macro takes a list of file names which the configure process
     should produce.  This is normally a list of one or more 'Makefile'
     files in different directories.  If your package lives entirely in
     a single directory, you would use simply 'AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)'.  If
     you also have, for example, a 'lib' subdirectory, you would use
     'AC_OUTPUT(Makefile lib/Makefile)'.

   If you want to use locally defined macros in your 'configure.in'
file, then you will need to write a 'acinclude.m4' file which defines
them (if not using automake, this file is called 'aclocal.m4').
Alternatively, you can put separate macros in an 'm4' subdirectory, and
put 'ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4' in your 'Makefile.am' file so that the
'aclocal' program will be able to find them.

   The different macro prefixes indicate which tool defines the macro.
Macros which start with 'AC_' are part of autoconf.  Macros which start
with 'AM_' are provided by automake or libtool.


File: configure.info,  Node: Write Makefile.am,  Next: Write acconfig.h,  Prev: Write configure.in,  Up: Getting Started

2.2 Write Makefile.am
=====================

You must write the file 'Makefile.am'.  This is an automake input file,
and the automake manual describes in detail what this file should look
like.

   The automake commands in 'Makefile.am' mostly look like variable
assignments in a 'Makefile'.  automake recognizes special variable
names, and automatically add make rules to the output as needed.

   There will be one 'Makefile.am' file for each directory in your
package.  For each directory with subdirectories, the 'Makefile.am' file
should contain the line
     SUBDIRS = DIR DIR ...
where each DIR is the name of a subdirectory.

   For each 'Makefile.am', there should be a corresponding 'Makefile' in
the 'AC_OUTPUT' macro in 'configure.in'.

   Every 'Makefile.am' written at Cygnus should contain the line
     AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = cygnus
This puts automake into Cygnus mode.  See the automake manual for
details.

   You may to include the version number of 'automake' that you are
using on the 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS' line.  For example,
     AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = cygnus 1.3
This will prevent users from running an earlier version of 'automake'
and perhaps getting an invalid 'Makefile.in'.

   If your package builds a program, then in the directory where that
program is built you will normally want a line like
     bin_PROGRAMS = PROGRAM
where PROGRAM is the name of the program.  You will then want a line
like
     PROGRAM_SOURCES = FILE FILE ...
where each FILE is the name of a source file to link into the program
(e.g., 'foo.c').

   If your package builds a library, and you do not want the library to
ever be built as a shared library, then in the directory where that
library is built you will normally want a line like
     lib_LIBRARIES = libNAME.a
where 'libNAME.a' is the name of the library.  You will then want a line
like
     libNAME_a_SOURCES = FILE FILE ...
where each FILE is the name of a source file to add to the library.

   If your package builds a library, and you want to permit building the
library as a shared library, then in the directory where that library is
built you will normally want a line like
     lib_LTLIBRARIES = libNAME.la
   The use of 'LTLIBRARIES', and the '.la' extension, indicate a library
to be built using libtool.  As usual, you will then want a line like
     libNAME_la_SOURCES = FILE FILE ...

   The strings 'bin' and 'lib' that appear above in 'bin_PROGRAMS' and
'lib_LIBRARIES' are not arbitrary.  They refer to particular
directories, which may be set by the '--bindir' and '--libdir' options
to 'configure'.  If those options are not used, the default values are
based on the '--prefix' or '--exec-prefix' options to 'configure'.  It
is possible to use other names if the program or library should be
installed in some other directory.

   The 'Makefile.am' file may also contain almost anything that may
appear in a normal 'Makefile'.  automake also supports many other
special variables, as well as conditionals.

   See the automake manual for more information.


File: configure.info,  Node: Write acconfig.h,  Next: Generate files,  Prev: Write Makefile.am,  Up: Getting Started

2.3 Write acconfig.h
====================

If you are generating a portability header file, (i.e., you are using
'AM_CONFIG_HEADER' in 'configure.in'), then you will have to write a
'acconfig.h' file.  It will have to contain the following lines.

     /* Name of package.  */
     #undef PACKAGE

     /* Version of package.  */
     #undef VERSION

   This requirement is really a bug in the system, and the requirement
may be eliminated at some later date.

   The 'acconfig.h' file will also similar comment and '#undef' lines
for any unusual macros in the 'configure.in' file, including any macro
which appears in a 'AC_DEFINE' macro.

   In particular, if you are writing a GNU package and therefore include
'AC_DEFINE(_GNU_SOURCE)' in 'configure.in' as suggested above, you will
need lines like this in 'acconfig.h':
     /* Enable GNU extensions.  */
     #undef _GNU_SOURCE

   Normally the 'autoheader' program will inform you of any such
requirements by printing an error message when it is run.  However, if
you do anything particular odd in your 'configure.in' file, you will
have to make sure that the right entries appear in 'acconfig.h', since
otherwise the results of the tests may not be available in the
'config.h' file which your code will use.

   (Thee 'PACKAGE' and 'VERSION' lines are not required if you are not
using automake, and in that case you may not need a 'acconfig.h' file at
all).


File: configure.info,  Node: Generate files,  Next: Getting Started Example,  Prev: Write acconfig.h,  Up: Getting Started

2.4 Generate files
==================

Once you have written 'configure.in', 'Makefile.am', 'acconfig.h', and
possibly 'acinclude.m4', you must use autoconf and automake programs to
produce the first versions of the generated files.  This is done by
executing the following sequence of commands.

     aclocal
     autoconf
     autoheader
     automake

   The 'aclocal' and 'automake' commands are part of the automake
package, and the 'autoconf' and 'autoheader' commands are part of the
autoconf package.

   If you are using a 'm4' subdirectory for your macros, you will need
to use the '-I m4' option when you run 'aclocal'.

   If you are not using the Cygnus tree, use the '-a' option when
running 'automake' command in order to copy the required support files
into your source directory.

   If you are using libtool, you must build and install the libtool
package with the same '--prefix' and '--exec-prefix' options as you used
with the autoconf and automake packages.  You must do this before
running any of the above commands.  If you are not using the Cygnus
tree, you will need to run the 'libtoolize' program to copy the libtool
support files into your directory.

   Once you have managed to run these commands without getting any
errors, you should create a new empty directory, and run the 'configure'
script which will have been created by 'autoconf' with the
'--enable-maintainer-mode' option.  This will give you a set of
Makefiles which will include rules to automatically rebuild all the
generated files.

   After doing that, whenever you have changed some of the input files
and want to regenerated the other files, go to your object directory and
run 'make'.  Doing this is more reliable than trying to rebuild the
files manually, because there are complex order dependencies and it is
easy to forget something.


File: configure.info,  Node: Getting Started Example,  Prev: Generate files,  Up: Getting Started

2.5 Example
===========

Let's consider a trivial example.

   Suppose we want to write a simple version of 'touch'.  Our program,
which we will call 'poke', will take a single file name argument, and
use the 'utime' system call to set the modification and access times of
the file to the current time.  We want this program to be highly
portable.

   We'll first see what this looks like without using autoconf and
automake, and then see what it looks like with them.

* Menu:

* Getting Started Example 1::		First Try.
* Getting Started Example 2::		Second Try.
* Getting Started Example 3::		Third Try.
* Generate Files in Example::		Generate Files.


File: configure.info,  Node: Getting Started Example 1,  Next: Getting Started Example 2,  Up: Getting Started Example

2.5.1 First Try
---------------

Here is our first try at 'poke.c'.  Note that we've written it without
ANSI/ISO C prototypes, since we want it to be highly portable.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <utime.h>

     int
     main (argc, argv)
          int argc;
          char **argv;
     {
       if (argc != 2)
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Usage: poke file\n");
           exit (1);
         }

       if (utime (argv[1], NULL) < 0)
         {
           perror ("utime");
           exit (1);
         }

       exit (0);
     }

   We also write a simple 'Makefile'.

     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -g -O2

     all: poke

     poke: poke.o
     	$(CC) -o poke $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) poke.o

   So far, so good.

   Unfortunately, there are a few problems.

   On older Unix systems derived from BSD 4.3, the 'utime' system call
does not accept a second argument of 'NULL'.  On those systems, we need
to pass a pointer to 'struct utimbuf' structure.  Unfortunately, even
older systems don't define that structure; on those systems, we need to
pass an array of two 'long' values.

   The header file 'stdlib.h' was invented by ANSI C, and older systems
don't have a copy.  We included it above to get a declaration of 'exit'.

   We can find some of these portability problems by running 'autoscan',
which will create a 'configure.scan' file which we can use as a
prototype for our 'configure.in' file.  I won't show the output, but it
will notice the potential problems with 'utime' and 'stdlib.h'.

   In our 'Makefile', we don't provide any way to install the program.
This doesn't matter much for such a simple example, but a real program
will need an 'install' target.  For that matter, we will also want a
'clean' target.


File: configure.info,  Node: Getting Started Example 2,  Next: Getting Started Example 3,  Prev: Getting Started Example 1,  Up: Getting Started Example

2.5.2 Second Try
----------------

Here is our second try at this program.

   We modify 'poke.c' to use preprocessor macros to control what
features are available.  (I've cheated a bit by using the same macro
names which autoconf will use).

     #include <stdio.h>

     #ifdef STDC_HEADERS
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #endif

     #include <sys/types.h>

     #ifdef HAVE_UTIME_H
     #include <utime.h>
     #endif

     #ifndef HAVE_UTIME_NULL

     #include <time.h>

     #ifndef HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF

     struct utimbuf
     {
       long actime;
       long modtime;
     };

     #endif

     static int
     utime_now (file)
          char *file;
     {
       struct utimbuf now;

       now.actime = now.modtime = time (NULL);
       return utime (file, &now);
     }

     #define utime(f, p) utime_now (f)

     #endif /* HAVE_UTIME_NULL  */

     int
     main (argc, argv)
          int argc;
          char **argv;
     {
       if (argc != 2)
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Usage: poke file\n");
           exit (1);
         }

       if (utime (argv[1], NULL) < 0)
         {
           perror ("utime");
           exit (1);
         }

       exit (0);
     }

   Here is the associated 'Makefile'.  We've added support for the
preprocessor flags we use.  We've also added 'install' and 'clean'
targets.

     # Set this to your installation directory.
     bindir = /usr/local/bin

     # Uncomment this if you have the standard ANSI/ISO C header files.
     # STDC_HDRS = -DSTDC_HEADERS

     # Uncomment this if you have utime.h.
     # UTIME_H = -DHAVE_UTIME_H

     # Uncomment this if utime (FILE, NULL) works on your system.
     # UTIME_NULL = -DHAVE_UTIME_NULL

     # Uncomment this if struct utimbuf is defined in utime.h.
     # UTIMBUF = -DHAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF

     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -g -O2

     ALL_CFLAGS = $(STDC_HDRS) $(UTIME_H) $(UTIME_NULL) $(UTIMBUF) $(CFLAGS)

     all: poke

     poke: poke.o
     	$(CC) -o poke $(ALL_CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) poke.o

     .c.o:
     	$(CC) -c $(ALL_CFLAGS) poke.c

     install: poke
     	cp poke $(bindir)/poke

     clean:
     	rm poke poke.o

   Some problems with this approach should be clear.

   Users who want to compile poke will have to know how 'utime' works on
their systems, so that they can uncomment the 'Makefile' correctly.

   The installation is done using 'cp', but many systems have an
'install' program which may be used, and which supports optional
features such as stripping debugging information out of the installed
binary.

   The use of 'Makefile' variables like 'CC', 'CFLAGS' and 'LDFLAGS'
follows the requirements of the GNU standards.  This is convenient for
all packages, since it reduces surprises for users.  However, it is easy
to get the details wrong, and wind up with a slightly nonstandard
distribution.


File: configure.info,  Node: Getting Started Example 3,  Next: Generate Files in Example,  Prev: Getting Started Example 2,  Up: Getting Started Example

2.5.3 Third Try
---------------

For our third try at this program, we will write a 'configure.in' script
to discover the configuration features on the host system, rather than
requiring the user to edit the 'Makefile'.  We will also write a
'Makefile.am' rather than a 'Makefile'.

   The only change to 'poke.c' is to add a line at the start of the
file:
     #include "config.h"

   The new 'configure.in' file is as follows.

     AC_INIT(poke.c)
     AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(poke, 1.0)
     AM_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h:config.in)
     AC_PROG_CC
     AC_HEADER_STDC
     AC_CHECK_HEADERS(utime.h)
     AC_EGREP_HEADER(utimbuf, utime.h, AC_DEFINE(HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF))
     AC_FUNC_UTIME_NULL
     AC_OUTPUT(Makefile)

   The first four macros in this file, and the last one, were described
above; see *note Write configure.in::.  If we omit these macros, then
when we run 'automake' we will get a reminder that we need them.

   The other macros are standard autoconf macros.

'AC_HEADER_STDC'
     Check for standard C headers.
'AC_CHECK_HEADERS'
     Check whether a particular header file exists.
'AC_EGREP_HEADER'
     Check for a particular string in a particular header file, in this
     case checking for 'utimbuf' in 'utime.h'.
'AC_FUNC_UTIME_NULL'
     Check whether 'utime' accepts a NULL second argument to set the
     file change time to the current time.

   See the autoconf manual for a more complete description.

   The new 'Makefile.am' file is as follows.  Note how simple this is
compared to our earlier 'Makefile'.

     bin_PROGRAMS = poke

     poke_SOURCES = poke.c

   This means that we should build a single program name 'poke'.  It
should be installed in the binary directory, which we called 'bindir'
earlier.  The program 'poke' is built from the source file 'poke.c'.

   We must also write a 'acconfig.h' file.  Besides 'PACKAGE' and
'VERSION', which must be mentioned for all packages which use automake,
we must include 'HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF', since we mentioned it in an
'AC_DEFINE'.

     /* Name of package.  */
     #undef PACKAGE

     /* Version of package.  */
     #undef VERSION

     /* Whether utime.h defines struct utimbuf.  */
     #undef HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF


File: configure.info,  Node: Generate Files in Example,  Prev: Getting Started Example 3,  Up: Getting Started Example

2.5.4 Generate Files
--------------------

We must now generate the other files, using the following commands.

     aclocal
     autoconf
     autoheader
     automake

   When we run 'autoheader', it will remind us of any macros we forgot
to add to 'acconfig.h'.

   When we run 'automake', it will want to add some files to our
distribution.  It will add them automatically if we use the
'--add-missing' option.

   By default, 'automake' will run in GNU mode, which means that it will
want us to create certain additional files; as of this writing, it will
want 'NEWS', 'README', 'AUTHORS', and 'ChangeLog', all of which are
files which should appear in a standard GNU distribution.  We can either
add those files, or run 'automake' with the '--foreign' option.

   Running these tools will generate the following files, all of which
are described in the next chapter.

   * 'aclocal.m4'
   * 'configure'
   * 'config.in'
   * 'Makefile.in'
   * 'stamp-h.in'

     of autoconf macros.  It may also contain ordinary shell script
     code.  This file will contain feature tests for portability issues.
     The last thing in the file will normally be an 'AC_OUTPUT' macro
     listing which files to create when the builder runs the configure
     script.  This file is always required when using the GNU configure
     system.  *Note Write configure.in::.

'Makefile.am'
     This is the automake input file.  It describes how the code should
     be built.  It consists of definitions of automake variables.  It
     may also contain ordinary Makefile targets.  This file is only
     needed when using automake (newer tools normally use automake, but
     there are still older tools which have not been converted, in which
     the developer writes 'Makefile.in' directly).  *Note Write
     Makefile.am::.

'acconfig.h'
     When the configure script creates a portability header file, by
     using 'AM_CONFIG_HEADER' (or, if not using automake,
     'AC_CONFIG_HEADER'), this file is used to describe macros which are
     not recognized by the 'autoheader' command.  This is normally a
     fairly uninteresting file, consisting of a collection of '#undef'
     lines with comments.  Normally any call to 'AC_DEFINE' in
     'configure.in' will require a line in this file.  *Note Write
     acconfig.h::.

'acinclude.m4'
     This file is not always required.  It defines local autoconf
     macros.  These macros may then be used in 'configure.in'.  If you
     don't need any local autoconf macros, then you don't need this file
     at all.  In fact, in general, you never need local autoconf macros,
     since you can put everything in 'configure.in', but sometimes a
     local macro is convenient.

     Newer tools may omit 'acinclude.m4', and instead use a
     subdirectory, typically named 'm4', and define 'ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS =
     -I m4' in 'Makefile.am' to force 'aclocal' to look there for macro
     definitions.  The macro definitions are then placed in separate
     files in that directory.

     The 'acinclude.m4' file is only used when using automake; in older
     tools, the developer writes 'aclocal.m4' directly, if it is needed.

3.1.3 Generated Developer Files
-------------------------------

The following files would be generated by the developer.

   When using automake, these files are normally not generated manually
after the first time.  Instead, the generated 'Makefile' contains rules
to automatically rebuild the files as required.  When
'AM_MAINTAINER_MODE' is used in 'configure.in' (the normal case in
Cygnus code), the automatic rebuilding rules will only be defined if you
configure using the '--enable-maintainer-mode' option.

   When using automatic rebuilding, it is important to ensure that all
the various tools have been built and installed on your 'PATH'.  Using
automatic rebuilding is highly recommended, so much so that I'm not
going to explain what you have to do if you don't use it.

'configure'
     This is the configure script which will be run when building the
     package.  This is generated by 'autoconf' from 'configure.in' and
     'aclocal.m4'.  This is a shell script.

'Makefile.in'
     This is the file which the configure script will turn into the
     'Makefile' at build time.  This file is generated by 'automake'
     from 'Makefile.am'.  If you aren't using automake, you must write
     this file yourself.  This file is pretty much a normal 'Makefile',
     with some configure substitutions for certain variables.

'aclocal.m4'
     This file is created by the 'aclocal' program, based on the
     contents of 'configure.in' and 'acinclude.m4' (or, as noted in the
     description of 'acinclude.m4' above, on the contents of an 'm4'
     subdirectory).  This file contains definitions of autoconf macros
     which 'autoconf' will use when generating the file 'configure'.
     These autoconf macros may be defined by you in 'acinclude.m4' or
     they may be defined by other packages such as automake, libtool or
     gettext.  If you aren't using automake, you will normally write
     this file yourself; in that case, if 'configure.in' uses only
     standard autoconf macros, this file will not be needed at all.

'config.in'
     This file is created by 'autoheader' based on 'acconfig.h' and
     'configure.in'.  At build time, the configure script will define
     some of the macros in it to create 'config.h', which may then be
     included by your program.  This permits your C code to use
     preprocessor conditionals to change its behaviour based on the
     characteristics of the host system.  This file may also be called
     'config.h.in'.

'stamp.h-in'
     This rather uninteresting file, which I omitted from the picture,
     is generated by 'automake'.  It always contains the string
     'timestamp'.  It is used as a timestamp file indicating whether
     'config.in' is up to date.  Using a timestamp file means that
     'config.in' can be marked as up to date without actually changing
     its modification time.  This is useful since 'config.in' depends
     upon 'configure.in', but it is easy to change 'configure.in' in a
     way which does not affect 'config.in'.

3.2 Build Files
===============

This section describes the files which are created at configure and
build time.  These are the files which somebody who builds the package
will see.

   Of course, the developer will also build the package.  The
distinction between developer files and build files is not that the
developer does not see the build files, but that somebody who only
builds the package does not have to worry about the developer files.

3.2.1 Build Files Picture
-------------------------

Here is a picture of the files which will be created at build time.
'config.status' is both a created file and a shell script which is run
to create other files, and the picture attempts to show that.

   config.in        *configure*      Makefile.in

File: configure.info,  Node: Build Files Description,  Prev: Build Files Picture,  Up: Build Files

3.2.2 Build Files Description
-----------------------------

This is a description of the files which are created at build time.

'config.status'
     The first step in building a package is to run the 'configure'
     script.  The 'configure' script will create the file
     'config.status', which is itself a shell script.  When you first
     run 'configure', it will automatically run 'config.status'.  An
     'Makefile' derived from an automake generated 'Makefile.in' will
     contain rules to automatically run 'config.status' again when
     necessary to recreate certain files if their inputs change.

'Makefile'
     This is the file which make will read to build the program.  The
     'config.status' script will transform 'Makefile.in' into
     'Makefile'.

'config.h'
     This file defines C preprocessor macros which C code can use to
     adjust its behaviour on different systems.  The 'config.status'
     script will transform 'config.in' into 'config.h'.

'config.cache'
     This file did not fit neatly into the picture, and I omitted it.
     It is used by the 'configure' script to cache results between runs.
     This can be an important speedup.  If you modify 'configure.in' in
     such a way that the results of old tests should change (perhaps you
     have added a new library to 'LDFLAGS'), then you will have to
     remove 'config.cache' to force the tests to be rerun.

     The autoconf manual explains how to set up a site specific cache
     file.  This can speed up running 'configure' scripts on your
     system.

'stamp.h'
     This file, which I omitted from the picture, is similar to
     'stamp-h.in'.  It is used as a timestamp file indicating whether
     'config.h' is up to date.  This is useful since 'config.h' depends
     upon 'config.status', but it is easy for 'config.status' to change
     in a way which does not affect 'config.h'.


File: configure.info,  Node: Support Files,  Prev: Build Files,  Up: Files

3.3 Support Files
=================

The GNU configure and build system requires several support files to be
included with your distribution.  You do not normally need to concern
yourself with these.  If you are using the Cygnus tree, most are already
present.  Otherwise, they will be installed with your source by
'automake' (with the '--add-missing' option) and 'libtoolize'.

   You don't have to put the support files in the top level directory.
You can put them in a subdirectory, and use the 'AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR'
macro in 'configure.in' to tell 'automake' and the 'configure' script
where they are.

   In this section, I describe the support files, so that you can know
what they are and why they are there.

'ABOUT-NLS'
     Added by automake if you are using gettext.  This is a
     documentation file about the gettext project.
'ansi2knr.c'
     Used by an automake generated 'Makefile' if you put 'ansi2knr' in
     'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS' in 'Makefile.am'.  This permits compiling ANSI C
     code with a K&R C compiler.
'ansi2knr.1'
     The man page which goes with 'ansi2knr.c'.
'config.guess'
     A shell script which determines the configuration name for the
     system on which it is run.
'config.sub'
     A shell script which canonicalizes a configuration name entered by
     a user.
'elisp-comp'
     Used to compile Emacs LISP files.
'install-sh'
     A shell script which installs a program.  This is used if the
     configure script can not find an install binary.
'ltconfig'
     Used by libtool.  This is a shell script which configures libtool
     for the particular system on which it is used.
'ltmain.sh'
     Used by libtool.  This is the actual libtool script which is used,
     after it is configured by 'ltconfig' to build a library.
'mdate-sh'
     A shell script used by an automake generated 'Makefile' to pretty
     print the modification time of a file.  This is used to maintain
     version numbers for texinfo files.
'missing'
     A shell script used if some tool is missing entirely.  This is used
     by an automake generated 'Makefile' to avoid certain sorts of
     timestamp problems.
'mkinstalldirs'
     A shell script which creates a directory, including all parent
     directories.  This is used by an automake generated 'Makefile'
     during installation.
'texinfo.tex'
     Required if you have any texinfo files.  This is used when
     converting Texinfo files into DVI using 'texi2dvi' and TeX.
'ylwrap'
     A shell script used by an automake generated 'Makefile' to run
     programs like 'bison', 'yacc', 'flex', and 'lex'.  These programs
     default to producing output files with a fixed name, and the
     'ylwrap' script runs them in a subdirectory to avoid file name
     conflicts when using a parallel make program.

4 Configuration Names
*********************

The GNU configure system names all systems using a "configuration name".
All such names used to be triplets (they may now contain four parts in
certain cases), and the term "configuration triplet" is still seen.

* Menu:

* Configuration Name Definition::	Configuration Name Definition.
* Using Configuration Names::		Using Configuration Names.


File: configure.info,  Node: Configuration Name Definition,  Next: Using Configuration Names,  Up: Configuration Names

4.1 Configuration Name Definition
=================================

This is a string of the form CPU-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM.  In some
cases, this is extended to a four part form:
CPU-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM.

   When using a configuration name in a configure option, it is normally
not necessary to specify an entire name.  In particular, the
MANUFACTURER field is often omitted, leading to strings such as
'i386-linux' or 'sparc-sunos'.  The shell script 'config.sub' will
translate these shortened strings into the canonical form.  autoconf
will arrange for 'config.sub' to be run automatically when it is needed.

   The fields of a configuration name are as follows:

CPU
     The type of processor.  This is typically something like 'i386' or
     'sparc'.  More specific variants are used as well, such as 'mipsel'
     to indicate a little endian MIPS processor.
MANUFACTURER
     A somewhat freeform field which indicates the manufacturer of the
     system.  This is often simply 'unknown'.  Other common strings are
     'pc' for an IBM PC compatible system, or the name of a workstation
     vendor, such as 'sun'.
OPERATING_SYSTEM
     The name of the operating system which is run on the system.  This
     will be something like 'solaris2.5' or 'irix6.3'.  There is no
     particular restriction on the version number, and strings like
     'aix4.1.4.0' are seen.  For an embedded system, which has no
     operating system, this field normally indicates the type of object
     file format, such as 'elf' or 'coff'.
KERNEL
     This is used mainly for GNU/Linux.  A typical GNU/Linux
     configuration name is 'i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1'.  In this case the
     kernel, 'linux', is separated from the operating system,
     'gnulibc1'.

   The shell script 'config.guess' will normally print the correct
configuration name for the system on which it is run.  It does by
running 'uname' and by examining other characteristics of the system.

   Because 'config.guess' can normally determine the configuration name
for a machine, it is normally only necessary to specify a configuration
name when building a cross-compiler or when building using a
cross-compiler.


File: configure.info,  Node: Using Configuration Names,  Prev: Configuration Name Definition,  Up: Configuration Names

4.2 Using Configuration Names
=============================

A configure script will sometimes have to make a decision based on a
configuration name.  You will need to do this if you have to compile
code differently based on something which can not be tested using a
standard autoconf feature test.

   It is normally better to test for particular features, rather than to
test for a particular system.  This is because as Unix evolves,
different systems copy features from one another.  Even if you need to
determine whether the feature is supported based on a configuration
name, you should define a macro which describes the feature, rather than
defining a macro which describes the particular system you are on.

   Testing for a particular system is normally done using a case
statement in 'configure.in'.  The case statement might look something
like the following, assuming that 'host' is a shell variable holding a
canonical configuration name (which will be the case if 'configure.in'
uses the 'AC_CANONICAL_HOST' or 'AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM' macro).

     case "${host}" in
     i[3-7]86-*-linux-gnu*) do something ;;
     sparc*-sun-solaris2.[56789]*) do something ;;
     sparc*-sun-solaris*) do something ;;
     mips*-*-elf*) do something ;;
     esac

   It is particularly important to use '*' after the operating system
field, in order to match the version number which will be generated by
'config.guess'.

   In most cases you must be careful to match a range of processor
types.  For most processor families, a trailing '*' suffices, as in
'mips*' above.  For the i386 family, something along the lines of
'i[3-7]86' suffices at present.  For the m68k family, you will need
something like 'm68*'.  Of course, if you do not need to match on the
processor, it is simpler to just replace the entire field by a '*', as
in '*-*-irix*'.

5 Cross Compilation Tools
*************************

The GNU configure and build system can be used to build "cross
compilation" tools.  A cross compilation tool is a tool which runs on
one system and produces code which runs on another system.

* Host and Target::			Host and Target.

File: configure.info,  Node: Cross Compilation Concepts,  Next: Host and Target,  Up: Cross Compilation Tools

5.1 Cross Compilation Concepts
==============================

A compiler which produces programs which run on a different system is a
cross compilation compiler, or simply a "cross compiler".  Similarly, we
speak of cross assemblers, cross linkers, etc.

   In the normal case, a compiler produces code which runs on the same
system as the one on which the compiler runs.  When it is necessary to
distinguish this case from the cross compilation case, such a compiler
is called a "native compiler".  Similarly, we speak of native
assemblers, etc.

   Although the debugger is not strictly speaking a compilation tool, it
is nevertheless meaningful to speak of a cross debugger: a debugger
which is used to debug code which runs on another system.  Everything
that is said below about configuring cross compilation tools applies to
the debugger as well.


File: configure.info,  Node: Host and Target,  Next: Using the Host Type,  Prev: Cross Compilation Concepts,  Up: Cross Compilation Tools

5.2 Host and Target
===================

When building cross compilation tools, there are two different systems
involved: the system on which the tools will run, and the system for
which the tools generate code.

   The system on which the tools will run is called the "host" system.

   The system for which the tools generate code is called the "target"
system.

   For example, suppose you have a compiler which runs on a GNU/Linux
system and generates ELF programs for a MIPS embedded system.  In this
case the GNU/Linux system is the host, and the MIPS ELF system is the
target.  Such a compiler could be called a GNU/Linux cross MIPS ELF
compiler, or, equivalently, a 'i386-linux-gnu' cross 'mips-elf'
compiler.

   Naturally, most programs are not cross compilation tools.  For those
programs, it does not make sense to speak of a target.  It only makes
sense to speak of a target for tools like 'gcc' or the 'binutils' which
actually produce running code.  For example, it does not make sense to
speak of the target of a tool like 'bison' or 'make'.

   Most cross compilation tools can also serve as native tools.  For a
native compilation tool, it is still meaningful to speak of a target.
For a native tool, the target is the same as the host.  For example, for
a GNU/Linux native compiler, the host is GNU/Linux, and the target is
also GNU/Linux.


File: configure.info,  Node: Using the Host Type,  Next: Specifying the Target,  Prev: Host and Target,  Up: Cross Compilation Tools

5.3 Using the Host Type
=======================

In almost all cases the host system is the system on which you run the
'configure' script, and on which you build the tools (for the case when
they differ, *note Canadian Cross::).

   If your configure script needs to know the configuration name of the
host system, and the package is not a cross compilation tool and
therefore does not have a target, put 'AC_CANONICAL_HOST' in
'configure.in'.  This macro will arrange to define a few shell variables
when the 'configure' script is run.

'host'
     The canonical configuration name of the host.  This will normally
     be determined by running the 'config.guess' shell script, although
     the user is permitted to override this by using an explicit
     '--host' option.
'host_alias'
     In the unusual case that the user used an explicit '--host' option,
     this will be the argument to '--host'.  In the normal case, this
     will be the same as the 'host' variable.
'host_cpu'
'host_vendor'
'host_os'
     The first three parts of the canonical configuration name.

   The shell variables may be used by putting shell code in
'configure.in'.  For an example, see *note Using Configuration Names::.


File: configure.info,  Node: Specifying the Target,  Next: Using the Target Type,  Prev: Using the Host Type,  Up: Cross Compilation Tools

5.4 Specifying the Target
=========================

By default, the 'configure' script will assume that the target is the
same as the host.  This is the more common case; for example, it leads
to a native compiler rather than a cross compiler.

   If you want to build a cross compilation tool, you must specify the
target explicitly by using the '--target' option when you run
'configure'.  The argument to '--target' is the configuration name of
the system for which you wish to generate code.  *Note Configuration
Names::.

   For example, to build tools which generate code for a MIPS ELF
embedded system, you would use '--target mips-elf'.


File: configure.info,  Node: Using the Target Type,  Next: Cross Tools in the Cygnus Tree,  Prev: Specifying the Target,  Up: Cross Compilation Tools

5.5 Using the Target Type
=========================

When writing 'configure.in' for a cross compilation tool, you will need
to use information about the target.  To do this, put
'AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM' in 'configure.in'.

   'AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM' will look for a '--target' option and
canonicalize it using the 'config.sub' shell script.  It will also run
'AC_CANONICAL_HOST' (*note Using the Host Type::).

   The target type will be recorded in the following shell variables.
Note that the host versions of these variables will also be defined by
'AC_CANONICAL_HOST'.

'target'
     The canonical configuration name of the target.
'target_alias'
     The argument to the '--target' option.  If the user did not specify
     a '--target' option, this will be the same as 'host_alias'.
'target_cpu'
'target_vendor'
'target_os'
     The first three parts of the canonical target configuration name.

   Note that if 'host' and 'target' are the same string, you can assume
a native configuration.  If they are different, you can assume a cross
configuration.

   It is arguably possible for 'host' and 'target' to represent the same
system, but for the strings to not be identical.  For example, if
'config.guess' returns 'sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4', and somebody configures
with '--target sparc-sun-sunos4.1', then the slight differences between
the two versions of SunOS may be unimportant for your tool.  However, in
the general case it can be quite difficult to determine whether the
differences between two configuration names are significant or not.
Therefore, by convention, if the user specifies a '--target' option
without specifying a '--host' option, it is assumed that the user wants
to configure a cross compilation tool.

   The variables 'target' and 'target_alias' should be handled
differently.

   In general, whenever the user may actually see a string,
'target_alias' should be used.  This includes anything which may appear
in the file system, such as a directory name or part of a tool name.  It
also includes any tool output, unless it is clearly labelled as the
canonical target configuration name.  This permits the user to use the
'--target' option to specify how the tool will appear to the outside
world.

   On the other hand, when checking for characteristics of the target
system, 'target' should be used.  This is because a wide variety of
'--target' options may map into the same canonical configuration name.
You should not attempt to duplicate the canonicalization done by
'config.sub' in your own code.

   By convention, cross tools are installed with a prefix of the
argument used with the '--target' option, also known as 'target_alias'
(*note Using the Target Type::).  If the user does not use the
'--target' option, and thus is building a native tool, no prefix is
used.

   For example, if gcc is configured with '--target mips-elf', then the
installed binary will be named 'mips-elf-gcc'.  If gcc is configured
without a '--target' option, then the installed binary will be named
'gcc'.

   The autoconf macro 'AC_ARG_PROGRAM' will handle this for you.  If you
are using automake, no more need be done; the programs will
automatically be installed with the correct prefixes.  Otherwise, see
the autoconf documentation for 'AC_ARG_PROGRAM'.

5.6 Cross Tools in the Cygnus Tree
==================================

The Cygnus tree is used for various packages including gdb, the GNU
binutils, and egcs.  It is also, of course, used for Cygnus releases.

   In the Cygnus tree, the top level 'configure' script uses the old
Cygnus configure system, not autoconf.  The top level 'Makefile.in' is
written to build packages based on what is in the source tree, and
supports building a large number of tools in a single 'configure'/'make'
step.

   The Cygnus tree may be configured with a '--target' option.  The
'--target' option applies recursively to every subdirectory, and permits
building an entire set of cross tools at once.

File: configure.info,  Node: Host and Target Libraries,  Next: Target Library Configure Scripts,  Up: Cross Tools in the Cygnus Tree

5.6.1 Host and Target Libraries
-------------------------------

The Cygnus tree distinguishes host libraries from target libraries.

   Host libraries are built with the compiler used to build the programs
which run on the host, which is called the host compiler.  This includes
libraries such as 'bfd' and 'tcl'.  These libraries are built with the
host compiler, and are linked into programs like the binutils or gcc
which run on the host.

   Target libraries are built with the target compiler.  If gcc is
present in the source tree, then the target compiler is the gcc that is
built using the host compiler.  Target libraries are libraries such as
'newlib' and 'libstdc++'.  These libraries are not linked into the host
programs, but are instead made available for use with programs built
with the target compiler.

   For the rest of this section, assume that gcc is present in the
source tree, so that it will be used to build the target libraries.

   There is a complication here.  The configure process needs to know
which compiler you are going to use to build a tool; otherwise, the
feature tests will not work correctly.  The Cygnus tree handles this by
not configuring the target libraries until the target compiler is built.
In order to permit everything to build using a single
'configure'/'make', the configuration of the target libraries is
actually triggered during the make step.

   When the target libraries are configured, the '--target' option is
not used.  Instead, the '--host' option is used with the argument of the
'--target' option for the overall configuration.  If no '--target'
option was used for the overall configuration, the '--host' option will
be passed with the output of the 'config.guess' shell script.  Any
'--build' option is passed down unchanged.

   This translation of configuration options is done because since the
target libraries are compiled with the target compiler, they are being
built in order to run on the target of the overall configuration.  By
the definition of host, this means that their host system is the same as
the target system of the overall configuration.

   The same process is used for both a native configuration and a cross
configuration.  Even when using a native configuration, the target
libraries will be configured and built using the newly built compiler.
This is particularly important for the C++ libraries, since there is no
reason to assume that the C++ compiler used to build the host tools (if
there even is one) uses the same ABI as the g++ compiler which will be
used to build the target libraries.

   There is one difference between a native configuration and a cross
configuration.  In a native configuration, the target libraries are
normally configured and built as siblings of the host tools.  In a cross
configuration, the target libraries are normally built in a subdirectory
whose name is the argument to '--target'.  This is mainly for historical
reasons.

   To summarize, running 'configure' in the Cygnus tree configures all
the host libraries and tools, but does not configure any of the target
libraries.  Running 'make' then does the following steps:

   * Build the host libraries.
   * Build the host programs, including gcc.  Note that we call gcc both
     a host program (since it runs on the host) and a target compiler
     (since it generates code for the target).
   * Using the newly built target compiler, configure the target
     libraries.
   * Build the target libraries.

   The steps need not be done in precisely this order, since they are
actually controlled by 'Makefile' targets.

5.6.2 Target Library Configure Scripts
--------------------------------------

There are a few things you must know in order to write a configure
script for a target library.  This is just a quick sketch, and beginners
shouldn't worry if they don't follow everything here.

   The target libraries are configured and built using a newly built
target compiler.  There may not be any startup files or libraries for
this target compiler.  In fact, those files will probably be built as
part of some target library, which naturally means that they will not
exist when your target library is configured.

   This means that the configure script for a target library may not use
any test which requires doing a link.  This unfortunately includes many
useful autoconf macros, such as 'AC_CHECK_FUNCS'.  autoconf macros which
do a compile but not a link, such as 'AC_CHECK_HEADERS', may be used.

   This is a severe restriction, but normally not a fatal one, as target
libraries can often assume the presence of other target libraries, and
thus know which functions will be available.

   As of this writing, the autoconf macro 'AC_PROG_CC' does a link to
make sure that the compiler works.  This may fail in a target library,
so target libraries must use a different set of macros to locate the
compiler.  See the 'configure.in' file in a directory like 'libiberty'
or 'libgloss' for an example.

   As noted in the previous section, target libraries are sometimes
built in directories which are siblings to the host tools, and are
sometimes built in a subdirectory.  The '--with-target-subdir' configure
option will be passed when the library is configured.  Its value will be
an empty string if the target library is a sibling.  Its value will be
the name of the subdirectory if the target library is in a subdirectory.

   If the overall build is not a native build (i.e., the overall
configure used the '--target' option), then the library will be
configured with the '--with-cross-host' option.  The value of this
option will be the host system of the overall build.  Recall that the
host system of the library will be the target of the overall build.  If
the overall build is a native build, the '--with-cross-host' option will
not be used.

   A library which can be built both standalone and as a target library
may want to install itself into different directories depending upon the
case.  When built standalone, or when built native, the library should
be installed in '$(libdir)'.  When built as a target library which is
not native, the library should be installed in '$(tooldir)/lib'.  The
'--with-cross-host' option may be used to distinguish these cases.

   This same test of '--with-cross-host' may be used to see whether it
is OK to use link tests in the configure script.  If the
'--with-cross-host' option is not used, then the library is being built
either standalone or native, and a link should work.


File: configure.info,  Node: Make Targets in Cygnus Tree,  Next: Target libiberty,  Prev: Target Library Configure Scripts,  Up: Cross Tools in the Cygnus Tree

5.6.3 Make Targets in Cygnus Tree
---------------------------------

The top level 'Makefile' in the Cygnus tree defines targets for every
known subdirectory.

   For every subdirectory DIR which holds a host library or program, the
'Makefile' target 'all-DIR' will build that library or program.

   There are dependencies among host tools.  For example, building gcc
requires first building gas, because the gcc build process invokes the
target assembler.  These dependencies are reflected in the top level
'Makefile'.

   For every subdirectory DIR which holds a target library, the
'Makefile' target 'configure-target-DIR' will configure that library.
The 'Makefile' target 'all-target-DIR' will build that library.

   Every 'configure-target-DIR' target depends upon 'all-gcc', since
gcc, the target compiler, is required to configure the tool.  Every
'all-target-DIR' target depends upon the corresponding
'configure-target-DIR' target.

   There are several other targets which may be of interest for each
directory: 'install-DIR', 'clean-DIR', and 'check-DIR'.  There are also
corresponding 'target' versions of these for the target libraries , such
as 'install-target-DIR'.


File: configure.info,  Node: Target libiberty,  Prev: Make Targets in Cygnus Tree,  Up: Cross Tools in the Cygnus Tree

5.6.4 Target libiberty
----------------------

The 'libiberty' subdirectory is currently a special case, in that it is
the only directory which is built both using the host compiler and using
the target compiler.

   This is because the files in 'libiberty' are used when building the
host tools, and they are also incorporated into the 'libstdc++' target
library as support code.

   This duality does not pose any particular difficulties.  It means
that there are targets for both 'all-libiberty' and
'all-target-libiberty'.

   In a native configuration, when target libraries are not built in a
subdirectory, the same objects are normally used as both the host build
and the target build.  This is normally OK, since libiberty contains
only C code, and in a native configuration the results of the host
compiler and the target compiler are normally interoperable.

   Irix 6 is again an exception here, since the SGI native compiler
defaults to using the 'O32' ABI, and gcc defaults to using the 'N32'
ABI. On Irix 6, the target libraries are built in a subdirectory even
for a native configuration, avoiding this problem.

   There are currently no other libraries built for both the host and
the target, but there is no conceptual problem with adding more.

****************

It is possible to use the GNU configure and build system to build a
program which will run on a system which is different from the system on
which the tools are built.  In other words, it is possible to build
programs using a cross compiler.

   This is referred to as a "Canadian Cross".

6.1 Canadian Cross Example
==========================

Here is an example of a Canadian Cross.

   While running on a GNU/Linux, you can build a program which will run
on a Solaris system.  You would use a GNU/Linux cross Solaris compiler
to build the program.

   Of course, you could not run the resulting program on your GNU/Linux
system.  You would have to copy it over to a Solaris system before you
would run it.

   Of course, you could also simply build the programs on the Solaris
system in the first place.  However, perhaps the Solaris system is not
available for some reason; perhaps you actually don't have one, but you
want to build the tools for somebody else to use.  Or perhaps your
GNU/Linux system is much faster than your Solaris system.

   A Canadian Cross build is most frequently used when building programs
to run on a non-Unix system, such as DOS or Windows.  It may be simpler
to configure and build on a Unix system than to support the
configuration machinery on a non-Unix system.


File: configure.info,  Node: Canadian Cross Concepts,  Next: Build Cross Host Tools,  Prev: Canadian Cross Example,  Up: Canadian Cross

6.2 Canadian Cross Concepts
===========================

When building a Canadian Cross, there are at least two different systems
involved: the system on which the tools are being built, and the system
on which the tools will run.

   The system on which the tools are being built is called the "build"
system.

   The system on which the tools will run is called the host system.

   For example, if you are building a Solaris program on a GNU/Linux
system, as in the previous section, the build system would be GNU/Linux,
and the host system would be Solaris.

   It is, of course, possible to build a cross compiler using a Canadian
Cross (i.e., build a cross compiler using a cross compiler).  In this
case, the system for which the resulting cross compiler generates code
is called the target system.  (For a more complete discussion of host
and target systems, *note Host and Target::).

   An example of building a cross compiler using a Canadian Cross would
be building a Windows cross MIPS ELF compiler on a GNU/Linux system.  In
this case the build system would be GNU/Linux, the host system would be
Windows, and the target system would be MIPS ELF.

   The name Canadian Cross comes from the case when the build, host, and
target systems are all different.  At the time that these issues were
all being hashed out, Canada had three national political parties.


File: configure.info,  Node: Build Cross Host Tools,  Next: Build and Host Options,  Prev: Canadian Cross Concepts,  Up: Canadian Cross

6.3 Build Cross Host Tools
==========================

In order to configure a program for a Canadian Cross build, you must
first build and install the set of cross tools you will use to build the
program.

   These tools will be build cross host tools.  That is, they will run
on the build system, and will produce code that runs on the host system.

   It is easy to confuse the meaning of build and host here.  Always
remember that the build system is where you are doing the build, and the
host system is where the resulting program will run.  Therefore, you
need a build cross host compiler.

   In general, you must have a complete cross environment in order to do
the build.  This normally means a cross compiler, cross assembler, and
so forth, as well as libraries and include files for the host system.


File: configure.info,  Node: Build and Host Options,  Next: CCross not in Cygnus Tree,  Prev: Build Cross Host Tools,  Up: Canadian Cross

6.4 Build and Host Options
==========================

When you run 'configure', you must use both the '--build' and '--host'
options.

   The '--build' option is used to specify the configuration name of the
build system.  This can normally be the result of running the
'config.guess' shell script, and it is reasonable to use
'--build=`config.guess`'.

   The '--host' option is used to specify the configuration name of the
host system.

   As we explained earlier, 'config.guess' is used to set the default
value for the '--host' option (*note Using the Host Type::).  We can now
see that since 'config.guess' returns the type of system on which it is
run, it really identifies the build system.  Since the host system is
normally the same as the build system (i.e., people do not normally
build using a cross compiler), it is reasonable to use the result of
'config.guess' as the default for the host system when the '--host'
option is not used.

   It might seem that if the '--host' option were used without the
'--build' option that the configure script could run 'config.guess' to
determine the build system, and presume a Canadian Cross if the result
of 'config.guess' differed from the '--host' option.  However, for
historical reasons, some configure scripts are routinely run using an
explicit '--host' option, rather than using the default from
'config.guess'.  As noted earlier, it is difficult or impossible to
reliably compare configuration names (*note Using the Target Type::).
Therefore, by convention, if the '--host' option is used, but the
'--build' option is not used, then the build system defaults to the host
system.

6.5 Canadian Cross not in Cygnus Tree.
======================================

If you are not using the Cygnus tree, you must explicitly specify the
cross tools which you want to use to build the program.  This is done by
setting environment variables before running the 'configure' script.

   You must normally set at least the environment variables 'CC', 'AR',
and 'RANLIB' to the cross tools which you want to use to build.

   For some programs, you must set additional cross tools as well, such
as 'AS', 'LD', or 'NM'.

   You would set these environment variables to the build cross tools
which you are going to use.

   For example, if you are building a Solaris program on a GNU/Linux
system, and your GNU/Linux cross Solaris compiler were named
'solaris-gcc', then you would set the environment variable 'CC' to
'solaris-gcc'.

This section describes configuring and building a Canadian Cross when
using the Cygnus tree.

File: configure.info,  Node: Standard Cygnus CCross,  Next: Cross Cygnus CCross,  Up: CCross in Cygnus Tree

6.6.1 Building a Normal Program
-------------------------------

When configuring a Canadian Cross in the Cygnus tree, all the
appropriate environment variables are automatically set to 'HOST-TOOL',
where HOST is the value used for the '--host' option, and TOOL is the
name of the tool (e.g., 'gcc', 'as', etc.).  These tools must be on your
'PATH'.

   Adding a prefix of HOST will give the usual name for the build cross
host tools.  To see this, consider that when these cross tools were
built, they were configured to run on the build system and to produce
code for the host system.  That is, they were configured with a
'--target' option that is the same as the system which we are now
calling the host.  Recall that the default name for installed cross
tools uses the target system as a prefix (*note Using the Target
Type::).  Since that is the system which we are now calling the host,
HOST is the right prefix to use.

   For example, if you configure with '--build=i386-linux-gnu' and
'--host=solaris', then the Cygnus tree will automatically default to
using the compiler 'solaris-gcc'.  You must have previously built and
installed this compiler, probably by doing a build with no '--host'
option and with a '--target' option of 'solaris'.


File: configure.info,  Node: Cross Cygnus CCross,  Prev: Standard Cygnus CCross,  Up: CCross in Cygnus Tree

6.6.2 Building a Cross Program
------------------------------

There are additional considerations if you want to build a cross
compiler, rather than a native compiler, in the Cygnus tree using a
Canadian Cross.

   When you build a cross compiler using the Cygnus tree, then the
target libraries will normally be built with the newly built target
compiler (*note Host and Target Libraries::).  However, this will not
work when building with a Canadian Cross.  This is because the newly
built target compiler will be a program which runs on the host system,
and therefore will not be able to run on the build system.

   Therefore, when building a cross compiler with the Cygnus tree, you
must first install a set of build cross target tools.  These tools will
be used when building the target libraries.

   Note that this is not a requirement of a Canadian Cross in general.
For example, it would be possible to build just the host cross target
tools on the build system, to copy the tools to the host system, and to
build the target libraries on the host system.  The requirement for
build cross target tools is imposed by the Cygnus tree, which expects to
be able to build both host programs and target libraries in a single
'configure'/'make' step.  Because it builds these in a single step, it
expects to be able to build the target libraries on the build system,
which means that it must use a build cross target toolchain.

   For example, suppose you want to build a Windows cross MIPS ELF
compiler on a GNU/Linux system.  You must have previously installed both
a GNU/Linux cross Windows compiler and a GNU/Linux cross MIPS ELF
compiler.

   In order to build the Windows (configuration name 'i386-cygwin32')
cross MIPS ELF (configure name 'mips-elf') compiler, you might execute
the following commands (long command lines are broken across lines with
a trailing backslash as a continuation character).

     mkdir linux-x-cygwin32
     cd linux-x-cygwin32
     SRCDIR/configure --target i386-cygwin32 --prefix=INSTALLDIR \
       --exec-prefix=INSTALLDIR/H-i386-linux
     make
     make install
     cd ..
     mkdir linux-x-mips-elf
     cd linux-x-mips-elf
     SRCDIR/configure --target mips-elf --prefix=INSTALLDIR \
       --exec-prefix=INSTALLDIR/H-i386-linux
     make
     make install
     cd ..
     mkdir cygwin32-x-mips-elf
     cd cygwin32-x-mips-elf
     SRCDIR/configure --build=i386-linux-gnu --host=i386-cygwin32 \
       --target=mips-elf --prefix=WININSTALLDIR \
       --exec-prefix=WININSTALLDIR/H-i386-cygwin32
     make
     make install

   You would then copy the contents of WININSTALLDIR over to the Windows
machine, and run the resulting programs.

6.7 Supporting Canadian Cross
=============================

If you want to make it possible to build a program you are developing
using a Canadian Cross, you must take some care when writing your
configure and make rules.  Simple cases will normally work correctly.
However, it is not hard to write configure and make tests which will
fail in a Canadian Cross.

* CCross in Make::		Supporting Canadian Cross in Makefiles.


File: configure.info,  Node: CCross in Configure,  Next: CCross in Make,  Up: Supporting Canadian Cross

6.7.1 Supporting Canadian Cross in Configure Scripts
----------------------------------------------------

In a 'configure.in' file, after calling 'AC_PROG_CC', you can find out
whether this is a Canadian Cross configure by examining the shell
variable 'cross_compiling'.  In a Canadian Cross, which means that the
compiler is a cross compiler, 'cross_compiling' will be 'yes'.  In a
normal configuration, 'cross_compiling' will be 'no'.

   You ordinarily do not need to know the type of the build system in a
configure script.  However, if you do need that information, you can get
it by using the macro 'AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM', the same macro that is used
to determine the target system.  This macro will set the variables
'build', 'build_alias', 'build_cpu', 'build_vendor', and 'build_os',
which correspond to the similar 'target' and 'host' variables, except
that they describe the build system.

   When writing tests in 'configure.in', you must remember that you want
to test the host environment, not the build environment.

   Macros like 'AC_CHECK_FUNCS' which use the compiler will test the
host environment.  That is because the tests will be done by running the
compiler, which is actually a build cross host compiler.  If the
compiler can find the function, that means that the function is present
in the host environment.

   Tests like 'test -f /dev/ptyp0', on the other hand, will test the
build environment.  Remember that the configure script is running on the
build system, not the host system.  If your configure scripts examines
files, those files will be on the build system.  Whatever you determine
based on those files may or may not be the case on the host system.

   Most autoconf macros will work correctly for a Canadian Cross.  The
main exception is 'AC_TRY_RUN'.  This macro tries to compile and run a
test program.  This will fail in a Canadian Cross, because the program
will be compiled for the host system, which means that it will not run
on the build system.

   The 'AC_TRY_RUN' macro provides an optional argument to tell the
configure script what to do in a Canadian Cross.  If that argument is
not present, you will get a warning when you run 'autoconf':
     warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow cross compiling
This tells you that the resulting 'configure' script will not work with
a Canadian Cross.

   In some cases while it may better to perform a test at configure
time, it is also possible to perform the test at run time.  In such a
case you can use the cross compiling argument to 'AC_TRY_RUN' to tell
your program that the test could not be performed at configure time.

   There are a few other autoconf macros which will not work correctly
with a Canadian Cross: a partial list is 'AC_FUNC_GETPGRP',
'AC_FUNC_SETPGRP', 'AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED', and
'AC_SYS_RESTARTABLE_SYSCALLS'.  The 'AC_CHECK_SIZEOF' macro is generally
not very useful with a Canadian Cross; it permits an optional argument
indicating the default size, but there is no way to know what the
correct default should be.


File: configure.info,  Node: CCross in Make,  Prev: CCross in Configure,  Up: Supporting Canadian Cross

6.7.2 Supporting Canadian Cross in Makefiles.
---------------------------------------------

The main Canadian Cross issue in a 'Makefile' arises when you want to
use a subsidiary program to generate code or data which you will then
include in your real program.

   If you compile this subsidiary program using '$(CC)' in the usual
way, you will not be able to run it.  This is because '$(CC)' will build
a program for the host system, but the program is being built on the
build system.

   You must instead use a compiler for the build system, rather than the
host system.  In the Cygnus tree, this make variable '$(CC_FOR_BUILD)'
will hold a compiler for the build system.

   Note that you should not include 'config.h' in a file you are
compiling with '$(CC_FOR_BUILD)'.  The 'configure' script will build
'config.h' with information for the host system.  However, you are
compiling the file using a compiler for the build system (a native
compiler).  Subsidiary programs are normally simple filters which do no
user interaction, and it is normally possible to write them in a highly
portable fashion so that the absence of 'config.h' is not crucial.

   The gcc 'Makefile.in' shows a complex situation in which certain
files, such as 'rtl.c', must be compiled into both subsidiary programs
run on the build system and into the final program.  This approach may
be of interest for advanced build system hackers.  Note that the build
system compiler is rather confusingly called 'HOST_CC'.

7 Cygnus Configure
******************

The Cygnus configure script predates autoconf.  All of its interesting
features have been incorporated into autoconf.  No new programs should
be written to use the Cygnus configure script.

   However, the Cygnus configure script is still used in a few places:
at the top of the Cygnus tree and in a few target libraries in the
Cygnus tree.  Until those uses have been replaced with autoconf, some
brief notes are appropriate here.  This is not complete documentation,
but it should be possible to use this as a guide while examining the
scripts themselves.

File: configure.info,  Node: Cygnus Configure Basics,  Next: Cygnus Configure in C++ Libraries,  Up: Cygnus Configure

7.1 Cygnus Configure Basics
===========================

Cygnus configure does not use any generated files; there is no program
corresponding to 'autoconf'.  Instead, there is a single shell script
named 'configure' which may be found at the top of the Cygnus tree.
This shell script was written by hand; it was not generated by autoconf,
and it is incorrect, and indeed harmful, to run 'autoconf' in the top
level of a Cygnus tree.

   Cygnus configure works in a particular directory by examining the
file 'configure.in' in that directory.  That file is broken into four
separate shell scripts.

   The first is the contents of 'configure.in' up to a line that starts
with '# per-host:'.  This is the common part.

   The second is the rest of 'configure.in' up to a line that starts
with '# per-target:'.  This is the per host part.

   The third is the rest of 'configure.in' up to a line that starts with
'# post-target:'.  This is the per target part.

   The fourth is the remainder of 'configure.in'.  This is the post
target part.

   If any of these comment lines are missing, the corresponding shell
script is empty.

   Cygnus configure will first execute the common part.  This must set
the shell variable 'srctrigger' to the name of a source file, to confirm
that Cygnus configure is looking at the right directory.  This may set
the shell variables 'package_makefile_frag' and
'package_makefile_rules_frag'.

   Cygnus configure will next set the 'build' and 'host' shell
variables, and execute the per host part.  This may set the shell
variable 'host_makefile_frag'.

   Cygnus configure will next set the 'target' variable, and execute the
per target part.  This may set the shell variable
'target_makefile_frag'.

   Any of these scripts may set the 'subdirs' shell variable.  This
variable is a list of subdirectories where a 'Makefile.in' file may be
found.  Cygnus configure will automatically look for a 'Makefile.in'
file in the current directory.  The 'subdirs' shell variable is not
normally used, and I believe that the only directory which uses it at
present is 'newlib'.

   For each 'Makefile.in', Cygnus configure will automatically create a
'Makefile' by adding definitions for 'make' variables such as 'host' and
'target', and automatically editing the values of 'make' variables such
as 'prefix' if they are present.

   Also, if any of the 'makefile_frag' shell variables are set, Cygnus
configure will interpret them as file names relative to either the
working directory or the source directory, and will read the contents of
the file into the generated 'Makefile'.  The file contents will be read
in after the first line in 'Makefile.in' which starts with '####'.

   These 'Makefile' fragments are used to customize behaviour for a
particular host or target.  They serve to select particular files to
compile, and to define particular preprocessor macros by providing
values for 'make' variables which are then used during compilation.
Cygnus configure, unlike autoconf, normally does not do feature tests,
and normally requires support to be added manually for each new host.

   The 'Makefile' fragment support is similar to the autoconf
'AC_SUBST_FILE' macro.

   After creating each 'Makefile', the post target script will be run
(i.e., it may be run several times).  This script may further customize
the 'Makefile'.  When it is run, the shell variable 'Makefile' will hold
the name of the 'Makefile', including the appropriate directory
component.

   Like an autoconf generated 'configure' script, Cygnus configure will
create a file named 'config.status' which, when run, will automatically
recreate the configuration.  The 'config.status' file will simply
execute the Cygnus configure script again with the appropriate
arguments.

   Any of the parts of 'configure.in' may set the shell variables
'files' and 'links'.  Cygnus configure will set up symlinks from the
names in 'links' to the files named in 'files'.  This is similar to the
autoconf 'AC_LINK_FILES' macro.

   Finally, any of the parts of 'configure.in' may set the shell
variable 'configdirs' to a set of subdirectories.  If it is set, Cygnus
configure will recursively run the configure process in each
subdirectory.  If the subdirectory uses Cygnus configure, it will
contain a 'configure.in' file but no 'configure' file, in which case
Cygnus configure will invoke itself recursively.  If the subdirectory
has a 'configure' file, Cygnus configure assumes that it is an autoconf
generated 'configure' script, and simply invokes it directly.

7.2 Cygnus Configure in C++ Libraries
=====================================

The C++ library configure system, written by Per Bothner, deserves
special mention.  It uses Cygnus configure, but it does feature testing
like that done by autoconf generated 'configure' scripts.  This approach
is used in the libraries 'libio', 'libstdc++', and 'libg++'.

   Most of the 'Makefile' information is written out by the shell script
'libio/config.shared'.  Each 'configure.in' file sets certain shell
variables, and then invokes 'config.shared' to create two package
'Makefile' fragments.  These fragments are then incorporated into the
resulting 'Makefile' by the Cygnus configure script.

   The file '_G_config.h' is created in the 'libio' object directory by
running the shell script 'libio/gen-params'.  This shell script uses
feature tests to define macros and typedefs in '_G_config.h'.

8 Multilibs
***********

For some targets gcc may have different processor requirements depending
upon command line options.  An obvious example is the '-msoft-float'
option supported on several processors.  This option means that the
floating point registers are not available, which means that floating
point operations must be done by calling an emulation subroutine rather
than by using machine instructions.

   For such options, gcc is often configured to compile target libraries
twice: once with '-msoft-float' and once without.  When gcc compiles
target libraries more than once, the resulting libraries are called
"multilibs".

   Multilibs are not really part of the GNU configure and build system,
but we discuss them here since they require support in the 'configure'
scripts and 'Makefile's used for target libraries.

8.1 Multilibs in gcc
====================

In gcc, multilibs are defined by setting the variable 'MULTILIB_OPTIONS'
in the target 'Makefile' fragment.  Several other 'MULTILIB' variables
may also be defined there.  *Note The Target Makefile Fragment:
(gcc)Target Fragment.

   If you have built gcc, you can see what multilibs it uses by running
it with the '-print-multi-lib' option.  The output '.;' means that no
multilibs are used.  In general, the output is a sequence of lines, one
per multilib.  The first part of each line, up to the ';', is the name
of the multilib directory.  The second part is a list of compiler
options separated by '@' characters.

   Multilibs are built in a tree of directories.  The top of the tree,
represented by '.' in the list of multilib directories, is the default
library to use when no special compiler options are used.  The
subdirectories of the tree hold versions of the library to use when
particular compiler options are used.


File: configure.info,  Node: Multilibs in Target Libraries,  Prev: Multilibs in gcc,  Up: Multilibs

8.2 Multilibs in Target Libraries
=================================

The target libraries in the Cygnus tree are automatically built with
multilibs.  That means that each library is built multiple times.

   This default is set in the top level 'configure.in' file, by adding
'--enable-multilib' to the list of arguments passed to configure when it
is run for the target libraries (*note Host and Target Libraries::).

   Each target library uses the shell script 'config-ml.in', written by
Doug Evans, to prepare to build target libraries.  This shell script is
invoked after the 'Makefile' has been created by the 'configure' script.
If multilibs are not enabled, it does nothing, otherwise it modifies the
'Makefile' to support multilibs.

   The 'config-ml.in' script makes one copy of the 'Makefile' for each
multilib in the appropriate subdirectory.  When configuring in the
source directory (which is not recommended), it will build a symlink
tree of the sources in each subdirectory.

   The 'config-ml.in' script sets several variables in the various
'Makefile's.  The 'Makefile.in' must have definitions for these
variables already; 'config-ml.in' simply changes the existing values.
The 'Makefile' should use default values for these variables which will
do the right thing in the subdirectories.

'MULTISRCTOP'
     'config-ml.in' will set this to a sequence of '../' strings, where
     the number of strings is the number of multilib levels in the
     source tree.  The default value should be the empty string.
'MULTIBUILDTOP'
     'config-ml.in' will set this to a sequence of '../' strings, where
     the number of strings is number of multilib levels in the object
     directory.  The default value should be the empty string.  This
     will differ from 'MULTISRCTOP' when configuring in the source tree
     (which is not recommended).
'MULTIDIRS'
     In the top level 'Makefile' only, 'config-ml.in' will set this to
     the list of multilib subdirectories.  The default value should be
     the empty string.
'MULTISUBDIR'
     'config-ml.in' will set this to the installed subdirectory name to
     use for this subdirectory, with a leading '/'.  The default value
     shold be the empty string.
'MULTIDO'
'MULTICLEAN'
     In the top level 'Makefile' only, 'config-ml.in' will set these
     variables to commands to use when doing a recursive make.  These
     variables should both default to the string 'true', so that by
     default nothing happens.

   All references to the parent of the source directory should use the
variable 'MULTISRCTOP'.  Instead of writing '$(srcdir)/..', you must
write '$(srcdir)/$(MULTISRCTOP)..'.

   Similarly, references to the parent of the object directory should
use the variable 'MULTIBUILDTOP'.

   In the installation target, the libraries should be installed in the
subdirectory 'MULTISUBDIR'.  Instead of installing '$(libdir)/libfoo.a',
install '$(libdir)$(MULTISUBDIR)/libfoo.a'.

   The 'config-ml.in' script also modifies the top level 'Makefile' to
add 'multi-do' and 'multi-clean' targets which are used when building
multilibs.

   The default target of the 'Makefile' should include the following
command:
     @$(MULTIDO) $(FLAGS_TO_PASS) DO=all multi-do
This assumes that '$(FLAGS_TO_PASS)' is defined as a set of variables to
pass to a recursive invocation of 'make'.  This will build all the
multilibs.  Note that the default value of 'MULTIDO' is 'true', so by
default this command will do nothing.  It will only do something in the
top level 'Makefile' if multilibs were enabled.

   The 'install' target of the 'Makefile' should include the following
command:
     @$(MULTIDO) $(FLAGS_TO_PASS) DO=install multi-do

   In general, any operation, other than clean, which should be
performed on all the multilibs should use a '$(MULTIDO)' line, setting
the variable 'DO' to the target of each recursive call to 'make'.

   The 'clean' targets ('clean', 'mostlyclean', etc.)  should use
'$(MULTICLEAN)'.  For example, the 'clean' target should do this:
     @$(MULTICLEAN) DO=clean multi-clean

9 Frequently Asked Questions
****************************

Which do I run first, 'autoconf' or 'automake'?
     Except when you first add autoconf or automake support to a
     package, you shouldn't run either by hand.  Instead, configure with
     the '--enable-maintainer-mode' option, and let 'make' take care of
     it.

'autoconf' says something about undefined macros.
     This means that you have macros in your 'configure.in' which are
     not defined by 'autoconf'.  You may be using an old version of
     'autoconf'; try building and installing a newer one.  Make sure the
     newly installled 'autoconf' is first on your 'PATH'.  Also, see the
     next question.

My 'configure' script has stuff like 'CY_GNU_GETTEXT' in it.
     This means that you have macros in your 'configure.in' which should
     be defined in your 'aclocal.m4' file, but aren't.  This usually
     means that 'aclocal' was not able to appropriate definitions of the
     macros.  Make sure that you have installed all the packages you
     need.  In particular, make sure that you have installed libtool
     (this is where 'AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' is defined) and gettext (this is
     where 'CY_GNU_GETTEXT' is defined, at least in the Cygnus version
     of gettext).

My 'Makefile' has '@' characters in it.
     This may mean that you tried to use an autoconf substitution in
     your 'Makefile.in' without adding the appropriate 'AC_SUBST' call
     to your 'configure' script.  Or it may just mean that you need to
     rebuild 'Makefile' in your build directory.  To rebuild 'Makefile'
     from 'Makefile.in', run the shell script 'config.status' with no
     arguments.  If you need to force 'configure' to run again, first
     run 'config.status --recheck'.  These runs are normally done
     automatically by 'Makefile' targets, but if your 'Makefile' has
     gotten messed up you'll need to help them along.

Why do I have to run both 'config.status --recheck' and 'config.status'?
     Normally, you don't; they will be run automatically by 'Makefile'
     targets.  If you do need to run them, use 'config.status --recheck'
     to run the 'configure' script again with the same arguments as the
     first time you ran it.  Use 'config.status' (with no arguments) to
     regenerate all files ('Makefile', 'config.h', etc.)  based on the
     results of the configure script.  The two cases are separate
     because it isn't always necessary to regenerate all the files after
     running 'config.status --recheck'.  The 'Makefile' targets
     generated by automake will use the environment variables
     'CONFIG_FILES' and 'CONFIG_HEADERS' to only regenerate files as
     they are needed.

What is the Cygnus tree?
     The Cygnus tree is used for various packages including gdb, the GNU
     binutils, and egcs.  It is also, of course, used for Cygnus
     releases.  It is the build system which was developed at Cygnus,
     using the Cygnus configure script.  It permits building many
     different packages with a single configure and make.  The configure
     scripts in the tree are being converted to autoconf, but the
     general build structure remains intact.

Why do I have to keep rebuilding and reinstalling the tools?
     I know, it's a pain.  Unfortunately, there are bugs in the tools
     themselves which need to be fixed, and each time that happens
     everybody who uses the tools need to reinstall new versions of
     them.  I don't know if there is going to be a clever fix until the
     tools stabilize.

Why not just have a Cygnus tree 'make' target to update the tools?
     The tools unfortunately need to be installed before they can be
     used.  That means that they must be built using an appropriate
     prefix, and it seems unwise to assume that every configuration uses
     an appropriate prefix.  It might be possible to make them work in
     place, or it might be possible to install them in some
     subdirectory; so far these approaches have not been implemented.

1 Overview
**********

The C preprocessor, often known as "cpp", is a "macro processor" that is
used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before
compilation.  It is called a macro processor because it allows you to
define "macros", which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

   The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and
Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general
text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of
character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it
preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.

   Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things
which are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
(Pascal, Ada, etc.)  So is assembly, with caution.  '-traditional-cpp'
mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many
of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

   Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the
language you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have
macro facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails, try
a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.

   C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU
C preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO
Standard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a
few things required by the standard.  These are features which are
rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning
of a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C,
you should use the '-std=c90', '-std=c99' or '-std=c11' options,
depending on which version of the standard you want.  To get all the
mandatory diagnostics, you must also use '-pedantic'.  *Note
Invocation::.

   This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To
minimize gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's behavior
does not conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional
preprocessor should behave the same way.  The various differences that
do exist are detailed in the section *note Traditional Mode::.

   For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to 'CPP' in this
manual refer to GNU CPP.

1.1 Character sets
==================

Source code character set processing in C and related languages is
rather complicated.  The C standard discusses two character sets, but
there are really at least four.

   The files input to CPP might be in any character set at all.  CPP's
very first action, before it even looks for line boundaries, is to
convert the file into the character set it uses for internal processing.
That set is what the C standard calls the "source" character set.  It
must be isomorphic with ISO 10646, also known as Unicode.  CPP uses the
UTF-8 encoding of Unicode.

   The character sets of the input files are specified using the
'-finput-charset=' option.

   All preprocessing work (the subject of the rest of this manual) is
carried out in the source character set.  If you request textual output
from the preprocessor with the '-E' option, it will be in UTF-8.

   After preprocessing is complete, string and character constants are
converted again, into the "execution" character set.  This character set
is under control of the user; the default is UTF-8, matching the source
character set.  Wide string and character constants have their own
character set, which is not called out specifically in the standard.
Again, it is under control of the user.  The default is UTF-16 or
UTF-32, whichever fits in the target's 'wchar_t' type, in the target
machine's byte order.(1)  Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences do not
undergo conversion; '\x12' has the value 0x12 regardless of the
currently selected execution character set.  All other escapes are
replaced by the character in the source character set that they
represent, then converted to the execution character set, just like
unescaped characters.

   Unless the experimental '-fextended-identifiers' option is used, GCC
does not permit the use of characters outside the ASCII range, nor '\u'
and '\U' escapes, in identifiers.  Even with that option, characters
outside the ASCII range can only be specified with the '\u' and '\U'
escapes, not used directly in identifiers.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) UTF-16 does not meet the requirements of the C standard for a
wide character set, but the choice of 16-bit 'wchar_t' is enshrined in
some system ABIs so we cannot fix this.

1.2 Initial processing
======================

The preprocessor performs a series of textual transformations on its
input.  These happen before all other processing.  Conceptually, they
happen in a rigid order, and the entire file is run through each
transformation before the next one begins.  CPP actually does them all
at once, for performance reasons.  These transformations correspond
roughly to the first three "phases of translation" described in the C
standard.

  1. The input file is read into memory and broken into lines.

     Different systems use different conventions to indicate the end of
     a line.  GCC accepts the ASCII control sequences 'LF', 'CR LF' and
     'CR' as end-of-line markers.  These are the canonical sequences
     used by Unix, DOS and VMS, and the classic Mac OS (before OSX)
     respectively.  You may therefore safely copy source code written on
     any of those systems to a different one and use it without
     conversion.  (GCC may lose track of the current line number if a
     file doesn't consistently use one convention, as sometimes happens
     when it is edited on computers with different conventions that
     share a network file system.)

     If the last line of any input file lacks an end-of-line marker, the
     end of the file is considered to implicitly supply one.  The C
     standard says that this condition provokes undefined behavior, so
     GCC will emit a warning message.

  2. If trigraphs are enabled, they are replaced by their corresponding
     single characters.  By default GCC ignores trigraphs, but if you
     request a strictly conforming mode with the '-std' option, or you
     specify the '-trigraphs' option, then it converts them.

     These are nine three-character sequences, all starting with '??',
     that are defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  They
     permit obsolete systems that lack some of C's punctuation to use C.
     For example, '??/' stands for '\', so '??/n' is a character
     constant for a newline.

     Trigraphs are not popular and many compilers implement them
     incorrectly.  Portable code should not rely on trigraphs being
     either converted or ignored.  With '-Wtrigraphs' GCC will warn you
     when a trigraph may change the meaning of your program if it were
     converted.  *Note Wtrigraphs::.

     In a string constant, you can prevent a sequence of question marks
     from being confused with a trigraph by inserting a backslash
     between the question marks, or by separating the string literal at
     the trigraph and making use of string literal concatenation.
     "(??\?)" is the string '(???)', not '(?]'.  Traditional C compilers
     do not recognize these idioms.

     The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

          Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
          Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

  3. Continued lines are merged into one long line.

     A continued line is a line which ends with a backslash, '\'.  The
     backslash is removed and the following line is joined with the
     current one.  No space is inserted, so you may split a line
     anywhere, even in the middle of a word.  (It is generally more
     readable to split lines only at white space.)

     The trailing backslash on a continued line is commonly referred to
     as a "backslash-newline".

     If there is white space between a backslash and the end of a line,
     that is still a continued line.  However, as this is usually the
     result of an editing mistake, and many compilers will not accept it
     as a continued line, GCC will warn you about it.

  4. All comments are replaced with single spaces.

     There are two kinds of comments.  "Block comments" begin with '/*'
     and continue until the next '*/'.  Block comments do not nest:

          /* this is /* one comment */ text outside comment

     "Line comments" begin with '//' and continue to the end of the
     current line.  Line comments do not nest either, but it does not
     matter, because they would end in the same place anyway.

          // this is // one comment
          text outside comment

   It is safe to put line comments inside block comments, or vice versa.

     /* block comment
        // contains line comment
        yet more comment
      */ outside comment

     // line comment /* contains block comment */

   But beware of commenting out one end of a block comment with a line
comment.

      // l.c.  /* block comment begins
         oops! this isn't a comment anymore */

   Comments are not recognized within string literals.  "/* blah */" is
the string constant '/* blah */', not an empty string.

   Line comments are not in the 1989 edition of the C standard, but they
are recognized by GCC as an extension.  In C++ and in the 1999 edition
of the C standard, they are an official part of the language.

   Since these transformations happen before all other processing, you
can split a line mechanically with backslash-newline anywhere.  You can
comment out the end of a line.  You can continue a line comment onto the
next line with backslash-newline.  You can even split '/*', '*/', and
'//' onto multiple lines with backslash-newline.  For example:

     /\
     *
     */ # /*
     */ defi\
     ne FO\
     O 10\
     20

is equivalent to '#define FOO 1020'.  All these tricks are extremely
confusing and should not be used in code intended to be readable.

   There is no way to prevent a backslash at the end of a line from
being interpreted as a backslash-newline.  This cannot affect any
correct program, however.

1.3 Tokenization
================

After the textual transformations are finished, the input file is
converted into a sequence of "preprocessing tokens".  These mostly
correspond to the syntactic tokens used by the C compiler, but there are
a few differences.  White space separates tokens; it is not itself a
token of any kind.  Tokens do not have to be separated by white space,
but it is often necessary to avoid ambiguities.

   When faced with a sequence of characters that has more than one
possible tokenization, the preprocessor is greedy.  It always makes each
token, starting from the left, as big as possible before moving on to
the next token.  For instance, 'a+++++b' is interpreted as
'a ++ ++ + b', not as 'a ++ + ++ b', even though the latter tokenization
could be part of a valid C program and the former could not.

   Once the input file is broken into tokens, the token boundaries never
change, except when the '##' preprocessing operator is used to paste
tokens together.  *Note Concatenation::.  For example,

     #define foo() bar
     foo()baz
          ==> bar baz
     _not_
          ==> barbaz

   The compiler does not re-tokenize the preprocessor's output.  Each
preprocessing token becomes one compiler token.

   Preprocessing tokens fall into five broad classes: identifiers,
preprocessing numbers, string literals, punctuators, and other.  An
"identifier" is the same as an identifier in C: any sequence of letters,
digits, or underscores, which begins with a letter or underscore.
Keywords of C have no significance to the preprocessor; they are
ordinary identifiers.  You can define a macro whose name is a keyword,
for instance.  The only identifier which can be considered a
preprocessing keyword is 'defined'.  *Note Defined::.

   This is mostly true of other languages which use the C preprocessor.
However, a few of the keywords of C++ are significant even in the
preprocessor.  *Note C++ Named Operators::.

   In the 1999 C standard, identifiers may contain letters which are not
part of the "basic source character set", at the implementation's
discretion (such as accented Latin letters, Greek letters, or Chinese
ideograms).  This may be done with an extended character set, or the
'\u' and '\U' escape sequences.  The implementation of this feature in
GCC is experimental; such characters are only accepted in the '\u' and
'\U' forms and only if '-fextended-identifiers' is used.

   As an extension, GCC treats '$' as a letter.  This is for
compatibility with some systems, such as VMS, where '$' is commonly used
in system-defined function and object names.  '$' is not a letter in
strictly conforming mode, or if you specify the '-$' option.  *Note
Invocation::.

   A "preprocessing number" has a rather bizarre definition.  The
category includes all the normal integer and floating point constants
one expects of C, but also a number of other things one might not
initially recognize as a number.  Formally, preprocessing numbers begin
with an optional period, a required decimal digit, and then continue
with any sequence of letters, digits, underscores, periods, and
exponents.  Exponents are the two-character sequences 'e+', 'e-', 'E+',
'E-', 'p+', 'p-', 'P+', and 'P-'.  (The exponents that begin with 'p' or
'P' are new to C99.  They are used for hexadecimal floating-point
constants.)

   The purpose of this unusual definition is to isolate the preprocessor
from the full complexity of numeric constants.  It does not have to
distinguish between lexically valid and invalid floating-point numbers,
which is complicated.  The definition also permits you to split an
identifier at any position and get exactly two tokens, which can then be
pasted back together with the '##' operator.

   It's possible for preprocessing numbers to cause programs to be
misinterpreted.  For example, '0xE+12' is a preprocessing number which
does not translate to any valid numeric constant, therefore a syntax
error.  It does not mean '0xE + 12', which is what you might have
intended.

   "String literals" are string constants, character constants, and
header file names (the argument of '#include').(1)  String constants and
character constants are straightforward: "..." or '...'.  In either case
embedded quotes should be escaped with a backslash: '\'' is the
character constant for '''.  There is no limit on the length of a
character constant, but the value of a character constant that contains
more than one character is implementation-defined.  *Note Implementation
Details::.

   Header file names either look like string constants, "...", or are
written with angle brackets instead, <...>.  In either case, backslash
is an ordinary character.  There is no way to escape the closing quote
or angle bracket.  The preprocessor looks for the header file in
different places depending on which form you use.  *Note Include
Operation::.

   No string literal may extend past the end of a line.  Older versions
of GCC accepted multi-line string constants.  You may use continued
lines instead, or string constant concatenation.  *Note Differences from
previous versions::.

   "Punctuators" are all the usual bits of punctuation which are
meaningful to C and C++.  All but three of the punctuation characters in
ASCII are C punctuators.  The exceptions are '@', '$', and '`'.  In
addition, all the two- and three-character operators are punctuators.
There are also six "digraphs", which the C++ standard calls "alternative
tokens", which are merely alternate ways to spell other punctuators.
This is a second attempt to work around missing punctuation in obsolete
systems.  It has no negative side effects, unlike trigraphs, but does
not cover as much ground.  The digraphs and their corresponding normal
punctuators are:

     Digraph:        <%  %>  <:  :>  %:  %:%:
     Punctuator:      {   }   [   ]   #    ##

   Any other single character is considered "other".  It is passed on to
the preprocessor's output unmolested.  The C compiler will almost
certainly reject source code containing "other" tokens.  In ASCII, the
only other characters are '@', '$', '`', and control characters other
than NUL (all bits zero).  (Note that '$' is normally considered a
letter.)  All characters with the high bit set (numeric range 0x7F-0xFF)
are also "other" in the present implementation.  This will change when
proper support for international character sets is added to GCC.

   NUL is a special case because of the high probability that its
appearance is accidental, and because it may be invisible to the user
(many terminals do not display NUL at all).  Within comments, NULs are
silently ignored, just as any other character would be.  In running
text, NUL is considered white space.  For example, these two directives
have the same meaning.

     #define X^@1
     #define X 1

(where '^@' is ASCII NUL).  Within string or character constants, NULs
are preserved.  In the latter two cases the preprocessor emits a warning
message.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The C standard uses the term "string literal" to refer only to
what we are calling "string constants".

1.4 The preprocessing language
==============================

After tokenization, the stream of tokens may simply be passed straight
to the compiler's parser.  However, if it contains any operations in the
"preprocessing language", it will be transformed first.  This stage
corresponds roughly to the standard's "translation phase 4" and is what
most people think of as the preprocessor's job.

   The preprocessing language consists of "directives" to be executed
and "macros" to be expanded.  Its primary capabilities are:

   * Inclusion of header files.  These are files of declarations that
     can be substituted into your program.

   * Macro expansion.  You can define "macros", which are abbreviations
     for arbitrary fragments of C code.  The preprocessor will replace
     the macros with their definitions throughout the program.  Some
     macros are automatically defined for you.

   * Conditional compilation.  You can include or exclude parts of the
     program according to various conditions.

   * Line control.  If you use a program to combine or rearrange source
     files into an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can use
     line control to inform the compiler where each source line
     originally came from.

   * Diagnostics.  You can detect problems at compile time and issue
     errors or warnings.

   There are a few more, less useful, features.

   Except for expansion of predefined macros, all these operations are
triggered with "preprocessing directives".  Preprocessing directives are
lines in your program that start with '#'.  Whitespace is allowed before
and after the '#'.  The '#' is followed by an identifier, the "directive
name".  It specifies the operation to perform.  Directives are commonly
referred to as '#NAME' where NAME is the directive name.  For example,
'#define' is the directive that defines a macro.

   The '#' which begins a directive cannot come from a macro expansion.
Also, the directive name is not macro expanded.  Thus, if 'foo' is
defined as a macro expanding to 'define', that does not make '#foo' a
valid preprocessing directive.

   The set of valid directive names is fixed.  Programs cannot define
new preprocessing directives.

   Some directives require arguments; these make up the rest of the
directive line and must be separated from the directive name by
whitespace.  For example, '#define' must be followed by a macro name and
the intended expansion of the macro.

   A preprocessing directive cannot cover more than one line.  The line
may, however, be continued with backslash-newline, or by a block comment
which extends past the end of the line.  In either case, when the
directive is processed, the continuations have already been merged with
the first line to make one long line.

2 Header Files
**************

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
(*note Macros::) to be shared between several source files.  You request
the use of a header file in your program by "including" it, with the C
preprocessing directive '#include'.

   Header files serve two purposes.

   * System header files declare the interfaces to parts of the
     operating system.  You include them in your program to supply the
     definitions and declarations you need to invoke system calls and
     libraries.

   * Your own header files contain declarations for interfaces between
     the source files of your program.  Each time you have a group of
     related declarations and macro definitions all or most of which are
     needed in several different source files, it is a good idea to
     create a header file for them.

   Including a header file produces the same results as copying the
header file into each source file that needs it.  Such copying would be
time-consuming and error-prone.  With a header file, the related
declarations appear in only one place.  If they need to be changed, they
can be changed in one place, and programs that include the header file
will automatically use the new version when next recompiled.  The header
file eliminates the labor of finding and changing all the copies as well
as the risk that a failure to find one copy will result in
inconsistencies within a program.

   In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end
with '.h'.  It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and
underscores in header file names, and at most one dot.

2.1 Include Syntax
==================

Both user and system header files are included using the preprocessing
directive '#include'.  It has two variants:

'#include <FILE>'
     This variant is used for system header files.  It searches for a
     file named FILE in a standard list of system directories.  You can
     prepend directories to this list with the '-I' option (*note
     Invocation::).

'#include "FILE"'
     This variant is used for header files of your own program.  It
     searches for a file named FILE first in the directory containing
     the current file, then in the quote directories and then the same
     directories used for '<FILE>'.  You can prepend directories to the
     list of quote directories with the '-iquote' option.

   The argument of '#include', whether delimited with quote marks or
angle brackets, behaves like a string constant in that comments are not
recognized, and macro names are not expanded.  Thus, '#include <x/*y>'
specifies inclusion of a system header file named 'x/*y'.

   However, if backslashes occur within FILE, they are considered
ordinary text characters, not escape characters.  None of the character
escape sequences appropriate to string constants in C are processed.
Thus, '#include "x\n\\y"' specifies a filename containing three
backslashes.  (Some systems interpret '\' as a pathname separator.  All
of these also interpret '/' the same way.  It is most portable to use
only '/'.)

   It is an error if there is anything (other than comments) on the line
after the file name.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Include Operation,  Next: Search Path,  Prev: Include Syntax,  Up: Header Files

2.2 Include Operation
=====================

The '#include' directive works by directing the C preprocessor to scan
the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the
current file.  The output from the preprocessor contains the output
already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included
file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the
'#include' directive.  For example, if you have a header file 'header.h'
as follows,

     char *test (void);

and a main program called 'program.c' that uses the header file, like
this,

     int x;
     #include "header.h"

     int
     main (void)
     {
       puts (test ());
     }

the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if 'program.c'
read

     int x;
     char *test (void);

     int
     main (void)
     {
       puts (test ());
     }

   Included files are not limited to declarations and macro definitions;
those are merely the typical uses.  Any fragment of a C program can be
included from another file.  The include file could even contain the
beginning of a statement that is concluded in the containing file, or
the end of a statement that was started in the including file.  However,
an included file must consist of complete tokens.  Comments and string
literals which have not been closed by the end of an included file are
invalid.  For error recovery, they are considered to end at the end of
the file.

   To avoid confusion, it is best if header files contain only complete
syntactic units--function declarations or definitions, type
declarations, etc.

   The line following the '#include' directive is always treated as a
separate line by the C preprocessor, even if the included file lacks a
final newline.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Search Path,  Next: Once-Only Headers,  Prev: Include Operation,  Up: Header Files

2.3 Search Path
===============

GCC looks in several different places for headers.  On a normal Unix
system, if you do not instruct it otherwise, it will look for headers
requested with '#include <FILE>' in:

     /usr/local/include
     LIBDIR/gcc/TARGET/VERSION/include
     /usr/TARGET/include
     /usr/include

   For C++ programs, it will also look in
'LIBDIR/../include/c++/VERSION', first.  In the above, TARGET is the
canonical name of the system GCC was configured to compile code for;
often but not always the same as the canonical name of the system it
runs on.  VERSION is the version of GCC in use.

   You can add to this list with the '-IDIR' command line option.  All
the directories named by '-I' are searched, in left-to-right order,
_before_ the default directories.  The only exception is when 'dir' is
already searched by default.  In this case, the option is ignored and
the search order for system directories remains unchanged.

   Duplicate directories are removed from the quote and bracket search
chains before the two chains are merged to make the final search chain.
Thus, it is possible for a directory to occur twice in the final search
chain if it was specified in both the quote and bracket chains.

   You can prevent GCC from searching any of the default directories
with the '-nostdinc' option.  This is useful when you are compiling an
operating system kernel or some other program that does not use the
standard C library facilities, or the standard C library itself.  '-I'
options are not ignored as described above when '-nostdinc' is in
effect.

   GCC looks for headers requested with '#include "FILE"' first in the
directory containing the current file, then in the directories as
specified by '-iquote' options, then in the same places it would have
looked for a header requested with angle brackets.  For example, if
'/usr/include/sys/stat.h' contains '#include "types.h"', GCC looks for
'types.h' first in '/usr/include/sys', then in its usual search path.

   '#line' (*note Line Control::) does not change GCC's idea of the
directory containing the current file.

   You may put '-I-' at any point in your list of '-I' options.  This
has two effects.  First, directories appearing before the '-I-' in the
list are searched only for headers requested with quote marks.
Directories after '-I-' are searched for all headers.  Second, the
directory containing the current file is not searched for anything,
unless it happens to be one of the directories named by an '-I' switch.
'-I-' is deprecated, '-iquote' should be used instead.

   '-I. -I-' is not the same as no '-I' options at all, and does not
cause the same behavior for '<>' includes that '""' includes get with no
special options.  '-I.' searches the compiler's current working
directory for header files.  That may or may not be the same as the
directory containing the current file.

   If you need to look for headers in a directory named '-', write
'-I./-'.

   There are several more ways to adjust the header search path.  They
are generally less useful.  *Note Invocation::.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Once-Only Headers,  Next: Alternatives to Wrapper #ifndef,  Prev: Search Path,  Up: Header Files

2.4 Once-Only Headers
=====================

If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process
its contents twice.  This is very likely to cause an error, e.g. when
the compiler sees the same structure definition twice.  Even if it does
not, it will certainly waste time.

   The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real
contents of the file in a conditional, like this:

     /* File foo.  */
     #ifndef FILE_FOO_SEEN
     #define FILE_FOO_SEEN

     THE ENTIRE FILE

     #endif /* !FILE_FOO_SEEN */

   This construct is commonly known as a "wrapper #ifndef".  When the
header is included again, the conditional will be false, because
'FILE_FOO_SEEN' is defined.  The preprocessor will skip over the entire
contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it twice.

   CPP optimizes even further.  It remembers when a header file has a
wrapper '#ifndef'.  If a subsequent '#include' specifies that header,
and the macro in the '#ifndef' is still defined, it does not bother to
rescan the file at all.

   You can put comments outside the wrapper.  They will not interfere
with this optimization.

   The macro 'FILE_FOO_SEEN' is called the "controlling macro" or "guard
macro".  In a user header file, the macro name should not begin with
'_'.  In a system header file, it should begin with '__' to avoid
conflicts with user programs.  In any kind of header file, the macro
name should contain the name of the file and some additional text, to
avoid conflicts with other header files.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Alternatives to Wrapper #ifndef,  Next: Computed Includes,  Prev: Once-Only Headers,  Up: Header Files

2.5 Alternatives to Wrapper #ifndef
===================================

CPP supports two more ways of indicating that a header file should be
read only once.  Neither one is as portable as a wrapper '#ifndef' and
we recommend you do not use them in new programs, with the caveat that
'#import' is standard practice in Objective-C.

   CPP supports a variant of '#include' called '#import' which includes
a file, but does so at most once.  If you use '#import' instead of
'#include', then you don't need the conditionals inside the header file
to prevent multiple inclusion of the contents.  '#import' is standard in
Objective-C, but is considered a deprecated extension in C and C++.

   '#import' is not a well designed feature.  It requires the users of a
header file to know that it should only be included once.  It is much
better for the header file's implementor to write the file so that users
don't need to know this.  Using a wrapper '#ifndef' accomplishes this
goal.

   In the present implementation, a single use of '#import' will prevent
the file from ever being read again, by either '#import' or '#include'.
You should not rely on this; do not use both '#import' and '#include' to
refer to the same header file.

   Another way to prevent a header file from being included more than
once is with the '#pragma once' directive.  If '#pragma once' is seen
when scanning a header file, that file will never be read again, no
matter what.

   '#pragma once' does not have the problems that '#import' does, but it
is not recognized by all preprocessors, so you cannot rely on it in a
portable program.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Computed Includes,  Next: Wrapper Headers,  Prev: Alternatives to Wrapper #ifndef,  Up: Header Files

2.6 Computed Includes
=====================

Sometimes it is necessary to select one of several different header
files to be included into your program.  They might specify
configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating
systems, for instance.  You could do this with a series of conditionals,

     #if SYSTEM_1
     # include "system_1.h"
     #elif SYSTEM_2
     # include "system_2.h"
     #elif SYSTEM_3
     ...
     #endif

   That rapidly becomes tedious.  Instead, the preprocessor offers the
ability to use a macro for the header name.  This is called a "computed
include".  Instead of writing a header name as the direct argument of
'#include', you simply put a macro name there instead:

     #define SYSTEM_H "system_1.h"
     ...
     #include SYSTEM_H

'SYSTEM_H' will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for
'system_1.h' as if the '#include' had been written that way originally.
'SYSTEM_H' could be defined by your Makefile with a '-D' option.

   You must be careful when you define the macro.  '#define' saves
tokens, not text.  The preprocessor has no way of knowing that the macro
will be used as the argument of '#include', so it generates ordinary
tokens, not a header name.  This is unlikely to cause problems if you
use double-quote includes, which are close enough to string constants.
If you use angle brackets, however, you may have trouble.

   The syntax of a computed include is actually a bit more general than
the above.  If the first non-whitespace character after '#include' is
not '"' or '<', then the entire line is macro-expanded like running text
would be.

   If the line expands to a single string constant, the contents of that
string constant are the file to be included.  CPP does not re-examine
the string for embedded quotes, but neither does it process backslash
escapes in the string.  Therefore

     #define HEADER "a\"b"
     #include HEADER

looks for a file named 'a\"b'.  CPP searches for the file according to
the rules for double-quoted includes.

   If the line expands to a token stream beginning with a '<' token and
including a '>' token, then the tokens between the '<' and the first '>'
are combined to form the filename to be included.  Any whitespace
between tokens is reduced to a single space; then any space after the
initial '<' is retained, but a trailing space before the closing '>' is
ignored.  CPP searches for the file according to the rules for
angle-bracket includes.

   In either case, if there are any tokens on the line after the file
name, an error occurs and the directive is not processed.  It is also an
error if the result of expansion does not match either of the two
expected forms.

   These rules are implementation-defined behavior according to the C
standard.  To minimize the risk of different compilers interpreting your
computed includes differently, we recommend you use only a single
object-like macro which expands to a string constant.  This will also
minimize confusion for people reading your program.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Wrapper Headers,  Next: System Headers,  Prev: Computed Includes,  Up: Header Files

2.7 Wrapper Headers
===================

Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the contents of a system-provided
header file without editing it directly.  GCC's 'fixincludes' operation
does this, for example.  One way to do that would be to create a new
header file with the same name and insert it in the search path before
the original header.  That works fine as long as you're willing to
replace the old header entirely.  But what if you want to refer to the
old header from the new one?

   You cannot simply include the old header with '#include'.  That will
start from the beginning, and find your new header again.  If your
header is not protected from multiple inclusion (*note Once-Only
Headers::), it will recurse infinitely and cause a fatal error.

   You could include the old header with an absolute pathname:
     #include "/usr/include/old-header.h"
This works, but is not clean; should the system headers ever move, you
would have to edit the new headers to match.

   There is no way to solve this problem within the C standard, but you
can use the GNU extension '#include_next'.  It means, "Include the
_next_ file with this name".  This directive works like '#include'
except in searching for the specified file: it starts searching the list
of header file directories _after_ the directory in which the current
file was found.

   Suppose you specify '-I /usr/local/include', and the list of
directories to search also includes '/usr/include'; and suppose both
directories contain 'signal.h'.  Ordinary '#include <signal.h>' finds
the file under '/usr/local/include'.  If that file contains
'#include_next <signal.h>', it starts searching after that directory,
and finds the file in '/usr/include'.

   '#include_next' does not distinguish between '<FILE>' and '"FILE"'
inclusion, nor does it check that the file you specify has the same name
as the current file.  It simply looks for the file named, starting with
the directory in the search path after the one where the current file
was found.

   The use of '#include_next' can lead to great confusion.  We recommend
it be used only when there is no other alternative.  In particular, it
should not be used in the headers belonging to a specific program; it
should be used only to make global corrections along the lines of
'fixincludes'.


File: cpp.info,  Node: System Headers,  Prev: Wrapper Headers,  Up: Header Files

2.8 System Headers
==================

The header files declaring interfaces to the operating system and
runtime libraries often cannot be written in strictly conforming C.
Therefore, GCC gives code found in "system headers" special treatment.
All warnings, other than those generated by '#warning' (*note
Diagnostics::), are suppressed while GCC is processing a system header.
Macros defined in a system header are immune to a few warnings wherever
they are expanded.  This immunity is granted on an ad-hoc basis, when we
find that a warning generates lots of false positives because of code in
macros defined in system headers.

   Normally, only the headers found in specific directories are
considered system headers.  These directories are determined when GCC is
compiled.  There are, however, two ways to make normal headers into
system headers.

   The '-isystem' command line option adds its argument to the list of
directories to search for headers, just like '-I'.  Any headers found in
that directory will be considered system headers.

   All directories named by '-isystem' are searched _after_ all
directories named by '-I', no matter what their order was on the command
line.  If the same directory is named by both '-I' and '-isystem', the
'-I' option is ignored.  GCC provides an informative message when this
occurs if '-v' is used.

   There is also a directive, '#pragma GCC system_header', which tells
GCC to consider the rest of the current include file a system header, no
matter where it was found.  Code that comes before the '#pragma' in the
file will not be affected.  '#pragma GCC system_header' has no effect in
the primary source file.

   On very old systems, some of the pre-defined system header
directories get even more special treatment.  GNU C++ considers code in
headers found in those directories to be surrounded by an 'extern "C"'
block.  There is no way to request this behavior with a '#pragma', or
from the command line.

3 Macros
********

A "macro" is a fragment of code which has been given a name.  Whenever
the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro.  There
are two kinds of macros.  They differ mostly in what they look like when
they are used.  "Object-like" macros resemble data objects when used,
"function-like" macros resemble function calls.

   You may define any valid identifier as a macro, even if it is a C
keyword.  The preprocessor does not know anything about keywords.  This
can be useful if you wish to hide a keyword such as 'const' from an
older compiler that does not understand it.  However, the preprocessor
operator 'defined' (*note Defined::) can never be defined as a macro,
and C++'s named operators (*note C++ Named Operators::) cannot be macros
when you are compiling C++.

File: cpp.info,  Node: Object-like Macros,  Next: Function-like Macros,  Up: Macros

3.1 Object-like Macros
======================

An "object-like macro" is a simple identifier which will be replaced by
a code fragment.  It is called object-like because it looks like a data
object in code that uses it.  They are most commonly used to give
symbolic names to numeric constants.

   You create macros with the '#define' directive.  '#define' is
followed by the name of the macro and then the token sequence it should
be an abbreviation for, which is variously referred to as the macro's
"body", "expansion" or "replacement list".  For example,

     #define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

defines a macro named 'BUFFER_SIZE' as an abbreviation for the token
'1024'.  If somewhere after this '#define' directive there comes a C
statement of the form

     foo = (char *) malloc (BUFFER_SIZE);

then the C preprocessor will recognize and "expand" the macro
'BUFFER_SIZE'.  The C compiler will see the same tokens as it would if
you had written

     foo = (char *) malloc (1024);

   By convention, macro names are written in uppercase.  Programs are
easier to read when it is possible to tell at a glance which names are
macros.

   The macro's body ends at the end of the '#define' line.  You may
continue the definition onto multiple lines, if necessary, using
backslash-newline.  When the macro is expanded, however, it will all
come out on one line.  For example,

     #define NUMBERS 1, \
                     2, \
                     3
     int x[] = { NUMBERS };
          ==> int x[] = { 1, 2, 3 };

The most common visible consequence of this is surprising line numbers
in error messages.

   There is no restriction on what can go in a macro body provided it
decomposes into valid preprocessing tokens.  Parentheses need not
balance, and the body need not resemble valid C code.  (If it does not,
you may get error messages from the C compiler when you use the macro.)

   The C preprocessor scans your program sequentially.  Macro
definitions take effect at the place you write them.  Therefore, the
following input to the C preprocessor

     foo = X;
     #define X 4
     bar = X;

produces

     foo = X;
     bar = 4;

   When the preprocessor expands a macro name, the macro's expansion
replaces the macro invocation, then the expansion is examined for more
macros to expand.  For example,

     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
     #define BUFSIZE 1024
     TABLESIZE
          ==> BUFSIZE
          ==> 1024

'TABLESIZE' is expanded first to produce 'BUFSIZE', then that macro is
expanded to produce the final result, '1024'.

   Notice that 'BUFSIZE' was not defined when 'TABLESIZE' was defined.
The '#define' for 'TABLESIZE' uses exactly the expansion you specify--in
this case, 'BUFSIZE'--and does not check to see whether it too contains
macro names.  Only when you _use_ 'TABLESIZE' is the result of its
expansion scanned for more macro names.

   This makes a difference if you change the definition of 'BUFSIZE' at
some point in the source file.  'TABLESIZE', defined as shown, will
always expand using the definition of 'BUFSIZE' that is currently in
effect:

     #define BUFSIZE 1020
     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
     #undef BUFSIZE
     #define BUFSIZE 37

Now 'TABLESIZE' expands (in two stages) to '37'.

   If the expansion of a macro contains its own name, either directly or
via intermediate macros, it is not expanded again when the expansion is
examined for more macros.  This prevents infinite recursion.  *Note
Self-Referential Macros::, for the precise details.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Function-like Macros,  Next: Macro Arguments,  Prev: Object-like Macros,  Up: Macros

3.2 Function-like Macros
========================

You can also define macros whose use looks like a function call.  These
are called "function-like macros".  To define a function-like macro, you
use the same '#define' directive, but you put a pair of parentheses
immediately after the macro name.  For example,

     #define lang_init()  c_init()
     lang_init()
          ==> c_init()

   A function-like macro is only expanded if its name appears with a
pair of parentheses after it.  If you write just the name, it is left
alone.  This can be useful when you have a function and a macro of the
same name, and you wish to use the function sometimes.

     extern void foo(void);
     #define foo() /* optimized inline version */
     ...
       foo();
       funcptr = foo;

   Here the call to 'foo()' will use the macro, but the function pointer
will get the address of the real function.  If the macro were to be
expanded, it would cause a syntax error.

   If you put spaces between the macro name and the parentheses in the
macro definition, that does not define a function-like macro, it defines
an object-like macro whose expansion happens to begin with a pair of
parentheses.

     #define lang_init ()    c_init()
     lang_init()
          ==> () c_init()()

   The first two pairs of parentheses in this expansion come from the
macro.  The third is the pair that was originally after the macro
invocation.  Since 'lang_init' is an object-like macro, it does not
consume those parentheses.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Macro Arguments,  Next: Stringification,  Prev: Function-like Macros,  Up: Macros

3.3 Macro Arguments
===================

Function-like macros can take "arguments", just like true functions.  To
define a macro that uses arguments, you insert "parameters" between the
pair of parentheses in the macro definition that make the macro
function-like.  The parameters must be valid C identifiers, separated by
commas and optionally whitespace.

   To invoke a macro that takes arguments, you write the name of the
macro followed by a list of "actual arguments" in parentheses, separated
by commas.  The invocation of the macro need not be restricted to a
single logical line--it can cross as many lines in the source file as
you wish.  The number of arguments you give must match the number of
parameters in the macro definition.  When the macro is expanded, each
use of a parameter in its body is replaced by the tokens of the
corresponding argument.  (You need not use all of the parameters in the
macro body.)

   As an example, here is a macro that computes the minimum of two
numeric values, as it is defined in many C programs, and some uses.

     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
       x = min(a, b);          ==>  x = ((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b));
       y = min(1, 2);          ==>  y = ((1) < (2) ? (1) : (2));
       z = min(a + 28, *p);    ==>  z = ((a + 28) < (*p) ? (a + 28) : (*p));

(In this small example you can already see several of the dangers of
macro arguments.  *Note Macro Pitfalls::, for detailed explanations.)

   Leading and trailing whitespace in each argument is dropped, and all
whitespace between the tokens of an argument is reduced to a single
space.  Parentheses within each argument must balance; a comma within
such parentheses does not end the argument.  However, there is no
requirement for square brackets or braces to balance, and they do not
prevent a comma from separating arguments.  Thus,

     macro (array[x = y, x + 1])

passes two arguments to 'macro': 'array[x = y' and 'x + 1]'.  If you
want to supply 'array[x = y, x + 1]' as an argument, you can write it as
'array[(x = y, x + 1)]', which is equivalent C code.

   All arguments to a macro are completely macro-expanded before they
are substituted into the macro body.  After substitution, the complete
text is scanned again for macros to expand, including the arguments.
This rule may seem strange, but it is carefully designed so you need not
worry about whether any function call is actually a macro invocation.
You can run into trouble if you try to be too clever, though.  *Note
Argument Prescan::, for detailed discussion.

   For example, 'min (min (a, b), c)' is first expanded to

       min (((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b)), (c))

and then to

     ((((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b))) < (c)
      ? (((a) < (b) ? (a) : (b)))
      : (c))

(Line breaks shown here for clarity would not actually be generated.)

   You can leave macro arguments empty; this is not an error to the
preprocessor (but many macros will then expand to invalid code).  You
cannot leave out arguments entirely; if a macro takes two arguments,
there must be exactly one comma at the top level of its argument list.
Here are some silly examples using 'min':

     min(, b)        ==> ((   ) < (b) ? (   ) : (b))
     min(a, )        ==> ((a  ) < ( ) ? (a  ) : ( ))
     min(,)          ==> ((   ) < ( ) ? (   ) : ( ))
     min((,),)       ==> (((,)) < ( ) ? ((,)) : ( ))

     min()      error-> macro "min" requires 2 arguments, but only 1 given
     min(,,)    error-> macro "min" passed 3 arguments, but takes just 2

   Whitespace is not a preprocessing token, so if a macro 'foo' takes
one argument, 'foo ()' and 'foo ( )' both supply it an empty argument.
Previous GNU preprocessor implementations and documentation were
incorrect on this point, insisting that a function-like macro that takes
a single argument be passed a space if an empty argument was required.

   Macro parameters appearing inside string literals are not replaced by
their corresponding actual arguments.

     #define foo(x) x, "x"
     foo(bar)        ==> bar, "x"

3.4 Stringification
===================

Sometimes you may want to convert a macro argument into a string
constant.  Parameters are not replaced inside string constants, but you
can use the '#' preprocessing operator instead.  When a macro parameter
is used with a leading '#', the preprocessor replaces it with the
literal text of the actual argument, converted to a string constant.
Unlike normal parameter replacement, the argument is not macro-expanded
first.  This is called "stringification".

   There is no way to combine an argument with surrounding text and
stringify it all together.  Instead, you can write a series of adjacent
string constants and stringified arguments.  The preprocessor will
replace the stringified arguments with string constants.  The C compiler
will then combine all the adjacent string constants into one long
string.

   Here is an example of a macro definition that uses stringification:

     #define WARN_IF(EXP) \
     do { if (EXP) \
             fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " #EXP "\n"); } \
     while (0)
     WARN_IF (x == 0);
          ==> do { if (x == 0)
                fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " "x == 0" "\n"); } while (0);

The argument for 'EXP' is substituted once, as-is, into the 'if'
statement, and once, stringified, into the argument to 'fprintf'.  If
'x' were a macro, it would be expanded in the 'if' statement, but not in
the string.

   The 'do' and 'while (0)' are a kludge to make it possible to write
'WARN_IF (ARG);', which the resemblance of 'WARN_IF' to a function would
make C programmers want to do; see *note Swallowing the Semicolon::.

   Stringification in C involves more than putting double-quote
characters around the fragment.  The preprocessor backslash-escapes the
quotes surrounding embedded string constants, and all backslashes within
string and character constants, in order to get a valid C string
constant with the proper contents.  Thus, stringifying 'p = "foo\n";'
results in "p = \"foo\\n\";".  However, backslashes that are not inside
string or character constants are not duplicated: '\n' by itself
stringifies to "\n".

   All leading and trailing whitespace in text being stringified is
ignored.  Any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text is
converted to a single space in the stringified result.  Comments are
replaced by whitespace long before stringification happens, so they
never appear in stringified text.

   There is no way to convert a macro argument into a character
constant.

   If you want to stringify the result of expansion of a macro argument,
you have to use two levels of macros.

     #define xstr(s) str(s)
     #define str(s) #s
     #define foo 4
     str (foo)
          ==> "foo"
     xstr (foo)
          ==> xstr (4)
          ==> str (4)
          ==> "4"

   's' is stringified when it is used in 'str', so it is not
macro-expanded first.  But 's' is an ordinary argument to 'xstr', so it
is completely macro-expanded before 'xstr' itself is expanded (*note
Argument Prescan::).  Therefore, by the time 'str' gets to its argument,
it has already been macro-expanded.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Concatenation,  Next: Variadic Macros,  Prev: Stringification,  Up: Macros

3.5 Concatenation
=================

It is often useful to merge two tokens into one while expanding macros.
This is called "token pasting" or "token concatenation".  The '##'
preprocessing operator performs token pasting.  When a macro is
expanded, the two tokens on either side of each '##' operator are
combined into a single token, which then replaces the '##' and the two
original tokens in the macro expansion.  Usually both will be
identifiers, or one will be an identifier and the other a preprocessing
number.  When pasted, they make a longer identifier.  This isn't the
only valid case.  It is also possible to concatenate two numbers (or a
number and a name, such as '1.5' and 'e3') into a number.  Also,
multi-character operators such as '+=' can be formed by token pasting.

   However, two tokens that don't together form a valid token cannot be
pasted together.  For example, you cannot concatenate 'x' with '+' in
either order.  If you try, the preprocessor issues a warning and emits
the two tokens.  Whether it puts white space between the tokens is
undefined.  It is common to find unnecessary uses of '##' in complex
macros.  If you get this warning, it is likely that you can simply
remove the '##'.

   Both the tokens combined by '##' could come from the macro body, but
you could just as well write them as one token in the first place.
Token pasting is most useful when one or both of the tokens comes from a
macro argument.  If either of the tokens next to an '##' is a parameter
name, it is replaced by its actual argument before '##' executes.  As
with stringification, the actual argument is not macro-expanded first.
If the argument is empty, that '##' has no effect.

   Keep in mind that the C preprocessor converts comments to whitespace
before macros are even considered.  Therefore, you cannot create a
comment by concatenating '/' and '*'.  You can put as much whitespace
between '##' and its operands as you like, including comments, and you
can put comments in arguments that will be concatenated.  However, it is
an error if '##' appears at either end of a macro body.

   Consider a C program that interprets named commands.  There probably
needs to be a table of commands, perhaps an array of structures declared
as follows:

     struct command
     {
       char *name;
       void (*function) (void);
     };

     struct command commands[] =
     {
       { "quit", quit_command },
       { "help", help_command },
       ...
     };

   It would be cleaner not to have to give each command name twice, once
in the string constant and once in the function name.  A macro which
takes the name of a command as an argument can make this unnecessary.
The string constant can be created with stringification, and the
function name by concatenating the argument with '_command'.  Here is
how it is done:

     #define COMMAND(NAME)  { #NAME, NAME ## _command }

     struct command commands[] =
     {
       COMMAND (quit),
       COMMAND (help),
       ...
     };

3.6 Variadic Macros
===================

A macro can be declared to accept a variable number of arguments much as
a function can.  The syntax for defining the macro is similar to that of
a function.  Here is an example:

     #define eprintf(...) fprintf (stderr, __VA_ARGS__)

   This kind of macro is called "variadic".  When the macro is invoked,
all the tokens in its argument list after the last named argument (this
macro has none), including any commas, become the "variable argument".
This sequence of tokens replaces the identifier '__VA_ARGS__' in the
macro body wherever it appears.  Thus, we have this expansion:

     eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file, lineno)
          ==>  fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: ", input_file, lineno)

   The variable argument is completely macro-expanded before it is
inserted into the macro expansion, just like an ordinary argument.  You
may use the '#' and '##' operators to stringify the variable argument or
to paste its leading or trailing token with another token.  (But see
below for an important special case for '##'.)

   If your macro is complicated, you may want a more descriptive name
for the variable argument than '__VA_ARGS__'.  CPP permits this, as an
extension.  You may write an argument name immediately before the '...';
that name is used for the variable argument.  The 'eprintf' macro above
could be written

     #define eprintf(args...) fprintf (stderr, args)

using this extension.  You cannot use '__VA_ARGS__' and this extension
in the same macro.

   You can have named arguments as well as variable arguments in a
variadic macro.  We could define 'eprintf' like this, instead:

     #define eprintf(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)

This formulation looks more descriptive, but unfortunately it is less
flexible: you must now supply at least one argument after the format
string.  In standard C, you cannot omit the comma separating the named
argument from the variable arguments.  Furthermore, if you leave the
variable argument empty, you will get a syntax error, because there will
be an extra comma after the format string.

     eprintf("success!\n", );
          ==> fprintf(stderr, "success!\n", );

   GNU CPP has a pair of extensions which deal with this problem.
First, you are allowed to leave the variable argument out entirely:

     eprintf ("success!\n")
          ==> fprintf(stderr, "success!\n", );

Second, the '##' token paste operator has a special meaning when placed
between a comma and a variable argument.  If you write

     #define eprintf(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, ##__VA_ARGS__)

and the variable argument is left out when the 'eprintf' macro is used,
then the comma before the '##' will be deleted.  This does _not_ happen
if you pass an empty argument, nor does it happen if the token preceding
'##' is anything other than a comma.

     eprintf ("success!\n")
          ==> fprintf(stderr, "success!\n");

The above explanation is ambiguous about the case where the only macro
parameter is a variable arguments parameter, as it is meaningless to try
to distinguish whether no argument at all is an empty argument or a
missing argument.  In this case the C99 standard is clear that the comma
must remain, however the existing GCC extension used to swallow the
comma.  So CPP retains the comma when conforming to a specific C
standard, and drops it otherwise.

   C99 mandates that the only place the identifier '__VA_ARGS__' can
appear is in the replacement list of a variadic macro.  It may not be
used as a macro name, macro argument name, or within a different type of
macro.  It may also be forbidden in open text; the standard is
ambiguous.  We recommend you avoid using it except for its defined
purpose.

   Variadic macros are a new feature in C99.  GNU CPP has supported them
for a long time, but only with a named variable argument ('args...', not
'...' and '__VA_ARGS__').  If you are concerned with portability to
previous versions of GCC, you should use only named variable arguments.
On the other hand, if you are concerned with portability to other
conforming implementations of C99, you should use only '__VA_ARGS__'.

   Previous versions of CPP implemented the comma-deletion extension
much more generally.  We have restricted it in this release to minimize
the differences from C99.  To get the same effect with both this and
previous versions of GCC, the token preceding the special '##' must be a
comma, and there must be white space between that comma and whatever
comes immediately before it:

     #define eprintf(format, args...) fprintf (stderr, format , ##args)

3.7 Predefined Macros
=====================

Several object-like macros are predefined; you use them without
supplying their definitions.  They fall into three classes: standard,
common, and system-specific.

   In C++, there is a fourth category, the named operators.  They act
like predefined macros, but you cannot undefine them.

* C++ Named Operators::


File: cpp.info,  Node: Standard Predefined Macros,  Next: Common Predefined Macros,  Up: Predefined Macros

3.7.1 Standard Predefined Macros
--------------------------------

The standard predefined macros are specified by the relevant language
standards, so they are available with all compilers that implement those
standards.  Older compilers may not provide all of them.  Their names
all start with double underscores.

'__FILE__'
     This macro expands to the name of the current input file, in the
     form of a C string constant.  This is the path by which the
     preprocessor opened the file, not the short name specified in
     '#include' or as the input file name argument.  For example,
     '"/usr/local/include/myheader.h"' is a possible expansion of this
     macro.

'__LINE__'
     This macro expands to the current input line number, in the form of
     a decimal integer constant.  While we call it a predefined macro,
     it's a pretty strange macro, since its "definition" changes with
     each new line of source code.

   '__FILE__' and '__LINE__' are useful in generating an error message
to report an inconsistency detected by the program; the message can
state the source line at which the inconsistency was detected.  For
example,

     fprintf (stderr, "Internal error: "
                      "negative string length "
                      "%d at %s, line %d.",
              length, __FILE__, __LINE__);

   An '#include' directive changes the expansions of '__FILE__' and
'__LINE__' to correspond to the included file.  At the end of that file,
when processing resumes on the input file that contained the '#include'
directive, the expansions of '__FILE__' and '__LINE__' revert to the
values they had before the '#include' (but '__LINE__' is then
incremented by one as processing moves to the line after the
'#include').

   A '#line' directive changes '__LINE__', and may change '__FILE__' as
well.  *Note Line Control::.

   C99 introduces '__func__', and GCC has provided '__FUNCTION__' for a
long time.  Both of these are strings containing the name of the current
function (there are slight semantic differences; see the GCC manual).
Neither of them is a macro; the preprocessor does not know the name of
the current function.  They tend to be useful in conjunction with
'__FILE__' and '__LINE__', though.

'__DATE__'
     This macro expands to a string constant that describes the date on
     which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
     eleven characters and looks like '"Feb 12 1996"'.  If the day of
     the month is less than 10, it is padded with a space on the left.

     If GCC cannot determine the current date, it will emit a warning
     message (once per compilation) and '__DATE__' will expand to
     '"??? ?? ????"'.

'__TIME__'
     This macro expands to a string constant that describes the time at
     which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
     eight characters and looks like '"23:59:01"'.

     If GCC cannot determine the current time, it will emit a warning
     message (once per compilation) and '__TIME__' will expand to
     '"??:??:??"'.

'__STDC__'
     In normal operation, this macro expands to the constant 1, to
     signify that this compiler conforms to ISO Standard C.  If GNU CPP
     is used with a compiler other than GCC, this is not necessarily
     true; however, the preprocessor always conforms to the standard
     unless the '-traditional-cpp' option is used.

     This macro is not defined if the '-traditional-cpp' option is used.

     On some hosts, the system compiler uses a different convention,
     where '__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies
     strict conformance to the C Standard.  CPP follows the host
     convention when processing system header files, but when processing
     user files '__STDC__' is always 1.  This has been reported to cause
     problems; for instance, some versions of Solaris provide X Windows
     headers that expect '__STDC__' to be either undefined or 1.  *Note
     Invocation::.

'__STDC_VERSION__'
     This macro expands to the C Standard's version number, a long
     integer constant of the form 'YYYYMML' where YYYY and MM are the
     year and month of the Standard version.  This signifies which
     version of the C Standard the compiler conforms to.  Like
     '__STDC__', this is not necessarily accurate for the entire
     implementation, unless GNU CPP is being used with GCC.

     The value '199409L' signifies the 1989 C standard as amended in
     1994, which is the current default; the value '199901L' signifies
     the 1999 revision of the C standard.  Support for the 1999 revision
     is not yet complete.

     This macro is not defined if the '-traditional-cpp' option is used,
     nor when compiling C++ or Objective-C.

'__STDC_HOSTED__'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, if the compiler's target is a
     "hosted environment".  A hosted environment has the complete
     facilities of the standard C library available.

'__cplusplus'
     This macro is defined when the C++ compiler is in use.  You can use
     '__cplusplus' to test whether a header is compiled by a C compiler
     or a C++ compiler.  This macro is similar to '__STDC_VERSION__', in
     that it expands to a version number.  Depending on the language
     standard selected, the value of the macro is '199711L', as mandated
     by the 1998 C++ standard; '201103L', per the 2011 C++ standard; an
     unspecified value strictly larger than '201103L' for the
     experimental languages enabled by '-std=c++1y' and '-std=gnu++1y'.

'__OBJC__'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, when the Objective-C compiler
     is in use.  You can use '__OBJC__' to test whether a header is
     compiled by a C compiler or an Objective-C compiler.

'__ASSEMBLER__'
     This macro is defined with value 1 when preprocessing assembly
     language.

3.7.2 Common Predefined Macros
------------------------------

The common predefined macros are GNU C extensions.  They are available
with the same meanings regardless of the machine or operating system on
which you are using GNU C or GNU Fortran.  Their names all start with
double underscores.

'__COUNTER__'
     This macro expands to sequential integral values starting from 0.
     In conjunction with the '##' operator, this provides a convenient
     means to generate unique identifiers.  Care must be taken to ensure
     that '__COUNTER__' is not expanded prior to inclusion of
     precompiled headers which use it.  Otherwise, the precompiled
     headers will not be used.

'__GFORTRAN__'
     The GNU Fortran compiler defines this.

'__GNUC__'
'__GNUC_MINOR__'
'__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__'
     These macros are defined by all GNU compilers that use the C
     preprocessor: C, C++, Objective-C and Fortran.  Their values are
     the major version, minor version, and patch level of the compiler,
     as integer constants.  For example, GCC 3.2.1 will define
     '__GNUC__' to 3, '__GNUC_MINOR__' to 2, and '__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__'
     to 1.  These macros are also defined if you invoke the preprocessor
     directly.

     '__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__' is new to GCC 3.0; it is also present in the
     widely-used development snapshots leading up to 3.0 (which identify
     themselves as GCC 2.96 or 2.97, depending on which snapshot you
     have).

     If all you need to know is whether or not your program is being
     compiled by GCC, or a non-GCC compiler that claims to accept the
     GNU C dialects, you can simply test '__GNUC__'.  If you need to
     write code which depends on a specific version, you must be more
     careful.  Each time the minor version is increased, the patch level
     is reset to zero; each time the major version is increased (which
     happens rarely), the minor version and patch level are reset.  If
     you wish to use the predefined macros directly in the conditional,
     you will need to write it like this:

          /* Test for GCC > 3.2.0 */
          #if __GNUC__ > 3 || \
              (__GNUC__ == 3 && (__GNUC_MINOR__ > 2 || \
                                 (__GNUC_MINOR__ == 2 && \
                                  __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ > 0))

     Another approach is to use the predefined macros to calculate a
     single number, then compare that against a threshold:

          #define GCC_VERSION (__GNUC__ * 10000 \
                               + __GNUC_MINOR__ * 100 \
                               + __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__)
          ...
          /* Test for GCC > 3.2.0 */
          #if GCC_VERSION > 30200

     Many people find this form easier to understand.

'__GNUG__'
     The GNU C++ compiler defines this.  Testing it is equivalent to
     testing '(__GNUC__ && __cplusplus)'.

'__STRICT_ANSI__'
     GCC defines this macro if and only if the '-ansi' switch, or a
     '-std' switch specifying strict conformance to some version of ISO
     C or ISO C++, was specified when GCC was invoked.  It is defined to
     '1'.  This macro exists primarily to direct GNU libc's header files
     to restrict their definitions to the minimal set found in the 1989
     C standard.

'__BASE_FILE__'
     This macro expands to the name of the main input file, in the form
     of a C string constant.  This is the source file that was specified
     on the command line of the preprocessor or C compiler.

'__INCLUDE_LEVEL__'
     This macro expands to a decimal integer constant that represents
     the depth of nesting in include files.  The value of this macro is
     incremented on every '#include' directive and decremented at the
     end of every included file.  It starts out at 0, its value within
     the base file specified on the command line.

'__ELF__'
     This macro is defined if the target uses the ELF object format.

'__VERSION__'
     This macro expands to a string constant which describes the version
     of the compiler in use.  You should not rely on its contents having
     any particular form, but it can be counted on to contain at least
     the release number.

'__OPTIMIZE__'
'__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__'
'__NO_INLINE__'
     These macros describe the compilation mode.  '__OPTIMIZE__' is
     defined in all optimizing compilations.  '__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__' is
     defined if the compiler is optimizing for size, not speed.
     '__NO_INLINE__' is defined if no functions will be inlined into
     their callers (when not optimizing, or when inlining has been
     specifically disabled by '-fno-inline').

     These macros cause certain GNU header files to provide optimized
     definitions, using macros or inline functions, of system library
     functions.  You should not use these macros in any way unless you
     make sure that programs will execute with the same effect whether
     or not they are defined.  If they are defined, their value is 1.

'__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__'
     GCC defines this macro if functions declared 'inline' will be
     handled in GCC's traditional gnu90 mode.  Object files will contain
     externally visible definitions of all functions declared 'inline'
     without 'extern' or 'static'.  They will not contain any
     definitions of any functions declared 'extern inline'.

'__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__'
     GCC defines this macro if functions declared 'inline' will be
     handled according to the ISO C99 standard.  Object files will
     contain externally visible definitions of all functions declared
     'extern inline'.  They will not contain definitions of any
     functions declared 'inline' without 'extern'.

     If this macro is defined, GCC supports the 'gnu_inline' function
     attribute as a way to always get the gnu90 behavior.  Support for
     this and '__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__' was added in GCC 4.1.3.  If neither
     macro is defined, an older version of GCC is being used: 'inline'
     functions will be compiled in gnu90 mode, and the 'gnu_inline'
     function attribute will not be recognized.

'__CHAR_UNSIGNED__'
     GCC defines this macro if and only if the data type 'char' is
     unsigned on the target machine.  It exists to cause the standard
     header file 'limits.h' to work correctly.  You should not use this
     macro yourself; instead, refer to the standard macros defined in
     'limits.h'.

'__WCHAR_UNSIGNED__'
     Like '__CHAR_UNSIGNED__', this macro is defined if and only if the
     data type 'wchar_t' is unsigned and the front-end is in C++ mode.

'__REGISTER_PREFIX__'
     This macro expands to a single token (not a string constant) which
     is the prefix applied to CPU register names in assembly language
     for this target.  You can use it to write assembly that is usable
     in multiple environments.  For example, in the 'm68k-aout'
     environment it expands to nothing, but in the 'm68k-coff'
     environment it expands to a single '%'.

'__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__'
     This macro expands to a single token which is the prefix applied to
     user labels (symbols visible to C code) in assembly.  For example,
     in the 'm68k-aout' environment it expands to an '_', but in the

     This macro will have the correct definition even if
     '-f(no-)underscores' is in use, but it will not be correct if
     target-specific options that adjust this prefix are used (e.g. the
     OSF/rose '-mno-underscores' option).

'__BYTE_ORDER__'
'__ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__'
'__ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN__'
'__ORDER_PDP_ENDIAN__'
     '__BYTE_ORDER__' is defined to one of the values
     '__ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__', '__ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN__', or
     '__ORDER_PDP_ENDIAN__' to reflect the layout of multi-byte and
     multi-word quantities in memory.  If '__BYTE_ORDER__' is equal to
     '__ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__' or '__ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN__', then
     multi-byte and multi-word quantities are laid out identically: the
     byte (word) at the lowest address is the least significant or most
     significant byte (word) of the quantity, respectively.  If
     '__BYTE_ORDER__' is equal to '__ORDER_PDP_ENDIAN__', then bytes in
     16-bit words are laid out in a little-endian fashion, whereas the
     16-bit subwords of a 32-bit quantity are laid out in big-endian
     fashion.

     You should use these macros for testing like this:

          /* Test for a little-endian machine */
          #if __BYTE_ORDER__ == __ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__

'__FLOAT_WORD_ORDER__'
     '__FLOAT_WORD_ORDER__' is defined to one of the values
     '__ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__' or '__ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN__' to reflect the
     layout of the words of multi-word floating-point quantities.

'__DEPRECATED'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, when compiling a C++ source
     file with warnings about deprecated constructs enabled.  These
     warnings are enabled by default, but can be disabled with
     '-Wno-deprecated'.

'__EXCEPTIONS'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, when compiling a C++ source
     file with exceptions enabled.  If '-fno-exceptions' is used when
     compiling the file, then this macro is not defined.

'__GXX_RTTI'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, when compiling a C++ source
     file with runtime type identification enabled.  If '-fno-rtti' is
     used when compiling the file, then this macro is not defined.

'__USING_SJLJ_EXCEPTIONS__'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, if the compiler uses the old
     mechanism based on 'setjmp' and 'longjmp' for exception handling.

'__GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__'
     This macro is defined when compiling a C++ source file with the
     option '-std=c++0x' or '-std=gnu++0x'.  It indicates that some
     features likely to be included in C++0x are available.  Note that
     these features are experimental, and may change or be removed in
     future versions of GCC.

'__GXX_WEAK__'
     This macro is defined when compiling a C++ source file.  It has the
     value 1 if the compiler will use weak symbols, COMDAT sections, or
     other similar techniques to collapse symbols with "vague linkage"
     that are defined in multiple translation units.  If the compiler
     will not collapse such symbols, this macro is defined with value 0.
     In general, user code should not need to make use of this macro;
     the purpose of this macro is to ease implementation of the C++
     runtime library provided with G++.

'__NEXT_RUNTIME__'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, if (and only if) the NeXT
     runtime (as in '-fnext-runtime') is in use for Objective-C.  If the
     GNU runtime is used, this macro is not defined, so that you can use
     this macro to determine which runtime (NeXT or GNU) is being used.

'__LP64__'
'_LP64'
     These macros are defined, with value 1, if (and only if) the
     compilation is for a target where 'long int' and pointer both use
     64-bits and 'int' uses 32-bit.

'__SSP__'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, when '-fstack-protector' is in
     use.

'__SSP_ALL__'
     This macro is defined, with value 2, when '-fstack-protector-all'
     is in use.

'__SSP_STRONG__'
     This macro is defined, with value 3, when
     '-fstack-protector-strong' is in use.

'__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__'
     This macro is defined, with value 1, when '-fsanitize=address' or
     '-fsanitize=kernel-address' are in use.

'__TIMESTAMP__'
     This macro expands to a string constant that describes the date and
     time of the last modification of the current source file.  The
     string constant contains abbreviated day of the week, month, day of
     the month, time in hh:mm:ss form, year and looks like
     '"Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973"'.  If the day of the month is less than
     10, it is padded with a space on the left.

     If GCC cannot determine the current date, it will emit a warning
     message (once per compilation) and '__TIMESTAMP__' will expand to
     '"??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? ????"'.

'__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_1'
'__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_2'
'__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_4'
'__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_8'
'__GCC_HAVE_SYNC_COMPARE_AND_SWAP_16'
     These macros are defined when the target processor supports atomic
     compare and swap operations on operands 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bytes in
     length, respectively.

'__GCC_HAVE_DWARF2_CFI_ASM'
     This macro is defined when the compiler is emitting Dwarf2 CFI
     directives to the assembler.  When this is defined, it is possible
     to emit those same directives in inline assembly.

'__FP_FAST_FMA'
'__FP_FAST_FMAF'
'__FP_FAST_FMAL'
     These macros are defined with value 1 if the backend supports the
     'fma', 'fmaf', and 'fmal' builtin functions, so that the include
     file 'math.h' can define the macros 'FP_FAST_FMA', 'FP_FAST_FMAF',
     and 'FP_FAST_FMAL' for compatibility with the 1999 C standard.

'__GCC_IEC_559'
     This macro is defined to indicate the intended level of support for
     IEEE 754 (IEC 60559) floating-point arithmetic.  It expands to a
     nonnegative integer value.  If 0, it indicates that the combination
     of the compiler configuration and the command-line options is not
     intended to support IEEE 754 arithmetic for 'float' and 'double' as
     defined in C99 and C11 Annex F (for example, that the standard
     rounding modes and exceptions are not supported, or that
     optimizations are enabled that conflict with IEEE 754 semantics).
     If 1, it indicates that IEEE 754 arithmetic is intended to be
     supported; this does not mean that all relevant language features
     are supported by GCC. If 2 or more, it additionally indicates
     support for IEEE 754-2008 (in particular, that the binary encodings
     for quiet and signaling NaNs are as specified in IEEE 754-2008).

     This macro does not indicate the default state of command-line
     options that control optimizations that C99 and C11 permit to be
     controlled by standard pragmas, where those standards do not
     require a particular default state.  It does not indicate whether
     optimizations respect signaling NaN semantics (the macro for that
     is '__SUPPORT_SNAN__').  It does not indicate support for decimal
     floating point or the IEEE 754 binary16 and binary128 types.

'__GCC_IEC_559_COMPLEX'
     This macro is defined to indicate the intended level of support for
     IEEE 754 (IEC 60559) floating-point arithmetic for complex numbers,
     as defined in C99 and C11 Annex G. It expands to a nonnegative
     integer value.  If 0, it indicates that the combination of the
     compiler configuration and the command-line options is not intended
     to support Annex G requirements (for example, because
     '-fcx-limited-range' was used).  If 1 or more, it indicates that it
     is intended to support those requirements; this does not mean that
     all relevant language features are supported by GCC.

3.7.3 System-specific Predefined Macros
---------------------------------------

The C preprocessor normally predefines several macros that indicate what
type of system and machine is in use.  They are obviously different on
each target supported by GCC.  This manual, being for all systems and
machines, cannot tell you what their names are, but you can use 'cpp
-dM' to see them all.  *Note Invocation::.  All system-specific
predefined macros expand to a constant value, so you can test them with
either '#ifdef' or '#if'.

   The C standard requires that all system-specific macros be part of
the "reserved namespace".  All names which begin with two underscores,
or an underscore and a capital letter, are reserved for the compiler and
library to use as they wish.  However, historically system-specific
macros have had names with no special prefix; for instance, it is common
to find 'unix' defined on Unix systems.  For all such macros, GCC
provides a parallel macro with two underscores added at the beginning
and the end.  If 'unix' is defined, '__unix__' will be defined too.
There will never be more than two underscores; the parallel of '_mips'
is '__mips__'.

   When the '-ansi' option, or any '-std' option that requests strict
conformance, is given to the compiler, all the system-specific
predefined macros outside the reserved namespace are suppressed.  The
parallel macros, inside the reserved namespace, remain defined.

   We are slowly phasing out all predefined macros which are outside the
reserved namespace.  You should never use them in new programs, and we
encourage you to correct older code to use the parallel macros whenever
you find it.  We don't recommend you use the system-specific macros that
are in the reserved namespace, either.  It is better in the long run to
check specifically for features you need, using a tool such as
'autoconf'.


File: cpp.info,  Node: C++ Named Operators,  Prev: System-specific Predefined Macros,  Up: Predefined Macros

3.7.4 C++ Named Operators
-------------------------

In C++, there are eleven keywords which are simply alternate spellings
of operators normally written with punctuation.  These keywords are
treated as such even in the preprocessor.  They function as operators in
'#if', and they cannot be defined as macros or poisoned.  In C, you can
request that those keywords take their C++ meaning by including
'iso646.h'.  That header defines each one as a normal object-like macro
expanding to the appropriate punctuator.

   These are the named operators and their corresponding punctuators:

Named Operator   Punctuator
'and'            '&&'
'and_eq'         '&='
'bitand'         '&'
'bitor'          '|'
'compl'          '~'
'not'            '!'
'not_eq'         '!='
'or'             '||'
'or_eq'          '|='
'xor'            '^'
'xor_eq'         '^='


File: cpp.info,  Node: Undefining and Redefining Macros,  Next: Directives Within Macro Arguments,  Prev: Predefined Macros,  Up: Macros

3.8 Undefining and Redefining Macros
====================================

If a macro ceases to be useful, it may be "undefined" with the '#undef'
directive.  '#undef' takes a single argument, the name of the macro to
undefine.  You use the bare macro name, even if the macro is
function-like.  It is an error if anything appears on the line after the
macro name.  '#undef' has no effect if the name is not a macro.

     #define FOO 4
     x = FOO;        ==> x = 4;
     #undef FOO
     x = FOO;        ==> x = FOO;

   Once a macro has been undefined, that identifier may be "redefined"
as a macro by a subsequent '#define' directive.  The new definition need
not have any resemblance to the old definition.

   However, if an identifier which is currently a macro is redefined,
then the new definition must be "effectively the same" as the old one.
Two macro definitions are effectively the same if:
   * Both are the same type of macro (object- or function-like).
   * All the tokens of the replacement list are the same.
   * If there are any parameters, they are the same.
   * Whitespace appears in the same places in both.  It need not be
     exactly the same amount of whitespace, though.  Remember that
     comments count as whitespace.

These definitions are effectively the same:
     #define FOUR (2 + 2)
     #define FOUR         (2    +    2)
     #define FOUR (2 /* two */ + 2)
but these are not:
     #define FOUR (2 + 2)
     #define FOUR ( 2+2 )
     #define FOUR (2 * 2)
     #define FOUR(score,and,seven,years,ago) (2 + 2)

   If a macro is redefined with a definition that is not effectively the
same as the old one, the preprocessor issues a warning and changes the
macro to use the new definition.  If the new definition is effectively
the same, the redefinition is silently ignored.  This allows, for
instance, two different headers to define a common macro.  The
preprocessor will only complain if the definitions do not match.

3.9 Directives Within Macro Arguments
=====================================

Occasionally it is convenient to use preprocessor directives within the
arguments of a macro.  The C and C++ standards declare that behavior in
these cases is undefined.

   Versions of CPP prior to 3.2 would reject such constructs with an
error message.  This was the only syntactic difference between normal
functions and function-like macros, so it seemed attractive to remove
this limitation, and people would often be surprised that they could not
use macros in this way.  Moreover, sometimes people would use
conditional compilation in the argument list to a normal library
function like 'printf', only to find that after a library upgrade
'printf' had changed to be a function-like macro, and their code would
no longer compile.  So from version 3.2 we changed CPP to successfully
process arbitrary directives within macro arguments in exactly the same
way as it would have processed the directive were the function-like
macro invocation not present.

   If, within a macro invocation, that macro is redefined, then the new
definition takes effect in time for argument pre-expansion, but the
original definition is still used for argument replacement.  Here is a
pathological example:

     #define f(x) x x
     f (1
     #undef f
     #define f 2
     f)

which expands to

     1 2 1 2

with the semantics described above.

3.10 Macro Pitfalls
===================

In this section we describe some special rules that apply to macros and
macro expansion, and point out certain cases in which the rules have
counter-intuitive consequences that you must watch out for.

File: cpp.info,  Node: Misnesting,  Next: Operator Precedence Problems,  Up: Macro Pitfalls

3.10.1 Misnesting
-----------------

When a macro is called with arguments, the arguments are substituted
into the macro body and the result is checked, together with the rest of
the input file, for more macro calls.  It is possible to piece together
a macro call coming partially from the macro body and partially from the
arguments.  For example,

     #define twice(x) (2*(x))
     #define call_with_1(x) x(1)
     call_with_1 (twice)
          ==> twice(1)
          ==> (2*(1))

   Macro definitions do not have to have balanced parentheses.  By
writing an unbalanced open parenthesis in a macro body, it is possible
to create a macro call that begins inside the macro body but ends
outside of it.  For example,

     #define strange(file) fprintf (file, "%s %d",
     ...
     strange(stderr) p, 35)
          ==> fprintf (stderr, "%s %d", p, 35)

   The ability to piece together a macro call can be useful, but the use
of unbalanced open parentheses in a macro body is just confusing, and
should be avoided.

3.10.2 Operator Precedence Problems
-----------------------------------

You may have noticed that in most of the macro definition examples shown
above, each occurrence of a macro argument name had parentheses around
it.  In addition, another pair of parentheses usually surround the
entire macro definition.  Here is why it is best to write macros that
way.

   Suppose you define a macro as follows,

     #define ceil_div(x, y) (x + y - 1) / y

whose purpose is to divide, rounding up.  (One use for this operation is
to compute how many 'int' objects are needed to hold a certain number of
'char' objects.)  Then suppose it is used as follows:

     a = ceil_div (b & c, sizeof (int));
          ==> a = (b & c + sizeof (int) - 1) / sizeof (int);

This does not do what is intended.  The operator-precedence rules of C
make it equivalent to this:

     a = (b & (c + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);

What we want is this:

     a = ((b & c) + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);

Defining the macro as

     #define ceil_div(x, y) ((x) + (y) - 1) / (y)

provides the desired result.

   Unintended grouping can result in another way.  Consider 'sizeof
ceil_div(1, 2)'.  That has the appearance of a C expression that would
compute the size of the type of 'ceil_div (1, 2)', but in fact it means
something very different.  Here is what it expands to:

     sizeof ((1) + (2) - 1) / (2)

This would take the size of an integer and divide it by two.  The
precedence rules have put the division outside the 'sizeof' when it was
intended to be inside.

   Parentheses around the entire macro definition prevent such problems.
Here, then, is the recommended way to define 'ceil_div':

     #define ceil_div(x, y) (((x) + (y) - 1) / (y))


File: cpp.info,  Node: Swallowing the Semicolon,  Next: Duplication of Side Effects,  Prev: Operator Precedence Problems,  Up: Macro Pitfalls

3.10.3 Swallowing the Semicolon
-------------------------------

Often it is desirable to define a macro that expands into a compound
statement.  Consider, for example, the following macro, that advances a
pointer (the argument 'p' says where to find it) across whitespace
characters:

     #define SKIP_SPACES(p, limit)  \
     { char *lim = (limit);         \
       while (p < lim) {            \
         if (*p++ != ' ') {         \
           p--; break; }}}

Here backslash-newline is used to split the macro definition, which must
be a single logical line, so that it resembles the way such code would
be laid out if not part of a macro definition.

   A call to this macro might be 'SKIP_SPACES (p, lim)'.  Strictly
speaking, the call expands to a compound statement, which is a complete
statement with no need for a semicolon to end it.  However, since it
looks like a function call, it minimizes confusion if you can use it
like a function call, writing a semicolon afterward, as in 'SKIP_SPACES
(p, lim);'

   This can cause trouble before 'else' statements, because the
semicolon is actually a null statement.  Suppose you write

     if (*p != 0)
       SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);
     else ...

The presence of two statements--the compound statement and a null
statement--in between the 'if' condition and the 'else' makes invalid C
code.

   The definition of the macro 'SKIP_SPACES' can be altered to solve
this problem, using a 'do ... while' statement.  Here is how:

     #define SKIP_SPACES(p, limit)     \
     do { char *lim = (limit);         \
          while (p < lim) {            \
            if (*p++ != ' ') {         \
              p--; break; }}}          \
     while (0)

   Now 'SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);' expands into

     do {...} while (0);

which is one statement.  The loop executes exactly once; most compilers
generate no extra code for it.

3.10.4 Duplication of Side Effects
----------------------------------

Many C programs define a macro 'min', for "minimum", like this:

     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))

   When you use this macro with an argument containing a side effect, as
shown here,

     next = min (x + y, foo (z));

it expands as follows:

     next = ((x + y) < (foo (z)) ? (x + y) : (foo (z)));

where 'x + y' has been substituted for 'X' and 'foo (z)' for 'Y'.

   The function 'foo' is used only once in the statement as it appears
in the program, but the expression 'foo (z)' has been substituted twice
into the macro expansion.  As a result, 'foo' might be called two times
when the statement is executed.  If it has side effects or if it takes a
long time to compute, the results might not be what you intended.  We
say that 'min' is an "unsafe" macro.

   The best solution to this problem is to define 'min' in a way that
computes the value of 'foo (z)' only once.  The C language offers no
standard way to do this, but it can be done with GNU extensions as
follows:

     #define min(X, Y)                \
     ({ typeof (X) x_ = (X);          \
        typeof (Y) y_ = (Y);          \
        (x_ < y_) ? x_ : y_; })

   The '({ ... })' notation produces a compound statement that acts as
an expression.  Its value is the value of its last statement.  This
permits us to define local variables and assign each argument to one.
The local variables have underscores after their names to reduce the
risk of conflict with an identifier of wider scope (it is impossible to
avoid this entirely).  Now each argument is evaluated exactly once.

   If you do not wish to use GNU C extensions, the only solution is to
be careful when _using_ the macro 'min'.  For example, you can calculate
the value of 'foo (z)', save it in a variable, and use that variable in
'min':

     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) < (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
     ...
     {
       int tem = foo (z);
       next = min (x + y, tem);
     }

(where we assume that 'foo' returns type 'int').


File: cpp.info,  Node: Self-Referential Macros,  Next: Argument Prescan,  Prev: Duplication of Side Effects,  Up: Macro Pitfalls

3.10.5 Self-Referential Macros
------------------------------

A "self-referential" macro is one whose name appears in its definition.
Recall that all macro definitions are rescanned for more macros to
replace.  If the self-reference were considered a use of the macro, it
would produce an infinitely large expansion.  To prevent this, the
self-reference is not considered a macro call.  It is passed into the
preprocessor output unchanged.  Consider an example:

     #define foo (4 + foo)

where 'foo' is also a variable in your program.

   Following the ordinary rules, each reference to 'foo' will expand
into '(4 + foo)'; then this will be rescanned and will expand into '(4 +
(4 + foo))'; and so on until the computer runs out of memory.

   The self-reference rule cuts this process short after one step, at
'(4 + foo)'.  Therefore, this macro definition has the possibly useful
effect of causing the program to add 4 to the value of 'foo' wherever
'foo' is referred to.

   In most cases, it is a bad idea to take advantage of this feature.  A
person reading the program who sees that 'foo' is a variable will not
expect that it is a macro as well.  The reader will come across the
identifier 'foo' in the program and think its value should be that of
the variable 'foo', whereas in fact the value is four greater.

   One common, useful use of self-reference is to create a macro which
expands to itself.  If you write

     #define EPERM EPERM

then the macro 'EPERM' expands to 'EPERM'.  Effectively, it is left
alone by the preprocessor whenever it's used in running text.  You can
tell that it's a macro with '#ifdef'.  You might do this if you want to
define numeric constants with an 'enum', but have '#ifdef' be true for
each constant.

   If a macro 'x' expands to use a macro 'y', and the expansion of 'y'
refers to the macro 'x', that is an "indirect self-reference" of 'x'.
'x' is not expanded in this case either.  Thus, if we have

     #define x (4 + y)
     #define y (2 * x)

then 'x' and 'y' expand as follows:

     x    ==> (4 + y)
          ==> (4 + (2 * x))

     y    ==> (2 * x)
          ==> (2 * (4 + y))

Each macro is expanded when it appears in the definition of the other
macro, but not when it indirectly appears in its own definition.

3.10.6 Argument Prescan
-----------------------

Macro arguments are completely macro-expanded before they are
substituted into a macro body, unless they are stringified or pasted
with other tokens.  After substitution, the entire macro body, including
the substituted arguments, is scanned again for macros to be expanded.
The result is that the arguments are scanned _twice_ to expand macro
calls in them.

   Most of the time, this has no effect.  If the argument contained any
macro calls, they are expanded during the first scan.  The result
therefore contains no macro calls, so the second scan does not change
it.  If the argument were substituted as given, with no prescan, the
single remaining scan would find the same macro calls and produce the
same results.

   You might expect the double scan to change the results when a
self-referential macro is used in an argument of another macro (*note
Self-Referential Macros::): the self-referential macro would be expanded
once in the first scan, and a second time in the second scan.  However,
this is not what happens.  The self-references that do not expand in the
first scan are marked so that they will not expand in the second scan
either.

   You might wonder, "Why mention the prescan, if it makes no
difference?  And why not skip it and make the preprocessor faster?"  The
answer is that the prescan does make a difference in three special
cases:

   * Nested calls to a macro.

     We say that "nested" calls to a macro occur when a macro's argument
     contains a call to that very macro.  For example, if 'f' is a macro
     that expects one argument, 'f (f (1))' is a nested pair of calls to
     'f'.  The desired expansion is made by expanding 'f (1)' and
     substituting that into the definition of 'f'.  The prescan causes
     the expected result to happen.  Without the prescan, 'f (1)' itself
     would be substituted as an argument, and the inner use of 'f' would
     appear during the main scan as an indirect self-reference and would
     not be expanded.

   * Macros that call other macros that stringify or concatenate.

     If an argument is stringified or concatenated, the prescan does not
     occur.  If you _want_ to expand a macro, then stringify or
     concatenate its expansion, you can do that by causing one macro to
     call another macro that does the stringification or concatenation.
     For instance, if you have

          #define AFTERX(x) X_ ## x
          #define XAFTERX(x) AFTERX(x)
          #define TABLESIZE 1024
          #define BUFSIZE TABLESIZE

     then 'AFTERX(BUFSIZE)' expands to 'X_BUFSIZE', and
     'XAFTERX(BUFSIZE)' expands to 'X_1024'.  (Not to 'X_TABLESIZE'.
     Prescan always does a complete expansion.)

   * Macros used in arguments, whose expansions contain unshielded
     commas.

     This can cause a macro expanded on the second scan to be called
     with the wrong number of arguments.  Here is an example:

          #define foo  a,b
          #define bar(x) lose(x)
          #define lose(x) (1 + (x))

     We would like 'bar(foo)' to turn into '(1 + (foo))', which would
     then turn into '(1 + (a,b))'.  Instead, 'bar(foo)' expands into
     'lose(a,b)', and you get an error because 'lose' requires a single
     argument.  In this case, the problem is easily solved by the same
     parentheses that ought to be used to prevent misnesting of
     arithmetic operations:

          #define foo (a,b)
     or
          #define bar(x) lose((x))

     The extra pair of parentheses prevents the comma in 'foo''s
     definition from being interpreted as an argument separator.

3.10.7 Newlines in Arguments
----------------------------

The invocation of a function-like macro can extend over many logical
lines.  However, in the present implementation, the entire expansion
comes out on one line.  Thus line numbers emitted by the compiler or
debugger refer to the line the invocation started on, which might be
different to the line containing the argument causing the problem.

   Here is an example illustrating this:

     #define ignore_second_arg(a,b,c) a; c

     ignore_second_arg (foo (),
                        ignored (),
                        syntax error);

The syntax error triggered by the tokens 'syntax error' results in an
error message citing line three--the line of ignore_second_arg-- even
though the problematic code comes from line five.

   We consider this a bug, and intend to fix it in the near future.

4 Conditionals
**************

A "conditional" is a directive that instructs the preprocessor to select
whether or not to include a chunk of code in the final token stream
passed to the compiler.  Preprocessor conditionals can test arithmetic
expressions, or whether a name is defined as a macro, or both
simultaneously using the special 'defined' operator.

   A conditional in the C preprocessor resembles in some ways an 'if'
statement in C, but it is important to understand the difference between
them.  The condition in an 'if' statement is tested during the execution
of your program.  Its purpose is to allow your program to behave
differently from run to run, depending on the data it is operating on.
The condition in a preprocessing conditional directive is tested when
your program is compiled.  Its purpose is to allow different code to be
included in the program depending on the situation at the time of
compilation.

   However, the distinction is becoming less clear.  Modern compilers
often do test 'if' statements when a program is compiled, if their
conditions are known not to vary at run time, and eliminate code which
can never be executed.  If you can count on your compiler to do this,
you may find that your program is more readable if you use 'if'
statements with constant conditions (perhaps determined by macros).  Of
course, you can only use this to exclude code, not type definitions or
other preprocessing directives, and you can only do it if the code
remains syntactically valid when it is not to be used.

   GCC version 3 eliminates this kind of never-executed code even when
not optimizing.  Older versions did it only when optimizing.

File: cpp.info,  Node: Conditional Uses,  Next: Conditional Syntax,  Up: Conditionals

4.1 Conditional Uses
====================

There are three general reasons to use a conditional.

   * A program may need to use different code depending on the machine
     or operating system it is to run on.  In some cases the code for
     one operating system may be erroneous on another operating system;
     for example, it might refer to data types or constants that do not
     exist on the other system.  When this happens, it is not enough to
     avoid executing the invalid code.  Its mere presence will cause the
     compiler to reject the program.  With a preprocessing conditional,
     the offending code can be effectively excised from the program when
     it is not valid.

   * You may want to be able to compile the same source file into two
     different programs.  One version might make frequent time-consuming
     consistency checks on its intermediate data, or print the values of
     those data for debugging, and the other not.

   * A conditional whose condition is always false is one way to exclude
     code from the program but keep it as a sort of comment for future
     reference.

   Simple programs that do not need system-specific logic or complex
debugging hooks generally will not need to use preprocessing
conditionals.

4.2 Conditional Syntax
======================

A conditional in the C preprocessor begins with a "conditional
directive": '#if', '#ifdef' or '#ifndef'.

* Menu:

* Ifdef::
* If::
* Defined::
* Else::
* Elif::


File: cpp.info,  Node: Ifdef,  Next: If,  Up: Conditional Syntax

4.2.1 Ifdef
-----------

The simplest sort of conditional is

     #ifdef MACRO

     CONTROLLED TEXT

     #endif /* MACRO */

   This block is called a "conditional group".  CONTROLLED TEXT will be
included in the output of the preprocessor if and only if MACRO is
defined.  We say that the conditional "succeeds" if MACRO is defined,
"fails" if it is not.

   The CONTROLLED TEXT inside of a conditional can include preprocessing
directives.  They are executed only if the conditional succeeds.  You
can nest conditional groups inside other conditional groups, but they
must be completely nested.  In other words, '#endif' always matches the
nearest '#ifdef' (or '#ifndef', or '#if').  Also, you cannot start a
conditional group in one file and end it in another.

   Even if a conditional fails, the CONTROLLED TEXT inside it is still
run through initial transformations and tokenization.  Therefore, it
must all be lexically valid C.  Normally the only way this matters is
that all comments and string literals inside a failing conditional group
must still be properly ended.

   The comment following the '#endif' is not required, but it is a good
practice if there is a lot of CONTROLLED TEXT, because it helps people
match the '#endif' to the corresponding '#ifdef'.  Older programs
sometimes put MACRO directly after the '#endif' without enclosing it in
a comment.  This is invalid code according to the C standard.  CPP
accepts it with a warning.  It never affects which '#ifndef' the
'#endif' matches.

   Sometimes you wish to use some code if a macro is _not_ defined.  You
can do this by writing '#ifndef' instead of '#ifdef'.  One common use of
'#ifndef' is to include code only the first time a header file is
included.  *Note Once-Only Headers::.

   Macro definitions can vary between compilations for several reasons.
Here are some samples.

   * Some macros are predefined on each kind of machine (*note
     System-specific Predefined Macros::).  This allows you to provide
     code specially tuned for a particular machine.

   * System header files define more macros, associated with the
     features they implement.  You can test these macros with
     conditionals to avoid using a system feature on a machine where it
     is not implemented.

   * Macros can be defined or undefined with the '-D' and '-U' command
     line options when you compile the program.  You can arrange to
     compile the same source file into two different programs by
     choosing a macro name to specify which program you want, writing
     conditionals to test whether or how this macro is defined, and then
     controlling the state of the macro with command line options,
     perhaps set in the Makefile.  *Note Invocation::.

   * Your program might have a special header file (often called
     'config.h') that is adjusted when the program is compiled.  It can
     define or not define macros depending on the features of the system
     and the desired capabilities of the program.  The adjustment can be
     automated by a tool such as 'autoconf', or done by hand.


File: cpp.info,  Node: If,  Next: Defined,  Prev: Ifdef,  Up: Conditional Syntax

4.2.2 If
--------

The '#if' directive allows you to test the value of an arithmetic
expression, rather than the mere existence of one macro.  Its syntax is

     #if EXPRESSION

     CONTROLLED TEXT

     #endif /* EXPRESSION */

   EXPRESSION is a C expression of integer type, subject to stringent
restrictions.  It may contain

   * Integer constants.

   * Character constants, which are interpreted as they would be in
     normal code.

   * Arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
     division, bitwise operations, shifts, comparisons, and logical
     operations ('&&' and '||').  The latter two obey the usual
     short-circuiting rules of standard C.

   * Macros.  All macros in the expression are expanded before actual
     computation of the expression's value begins.

   * Uses of the 'defined' operator, which lets you check whether macros
     are defined in the middle of an '#if'.

   * Identifiers that are not macros, which are all considered to be the
     number zero.  This allows you to write '#if MACRO' instead of
     '#ifdef MACRO', if you know that MACRO, when defined, will always
     have a nonzero value.  Function-like macros used without their
     function call parentheses are also treated as zero.

     In some contexts this shortcut is undesirable.  The '-Wundef'
     option causes GCC to warn whenever it encounters an identifier
     which is not a macro in an '#if'.

   The preprocessor does not know anything about types in the language.
Therefore, 'sizeof' operators are not recognized in '#if', and neither
are 'enum' constants.  They will be taken as identifiers which are not
macros, and replaced by zero.  In the case of 'sizeof', this is likely
to cause the expression to be invalid.

   The preprocessor calculates the value of EXPRESSION.  It carries out
all calculations in the widest integer type known to the compiler; on
most machines supported by GCC this is 64 bits.  This is not the same
rule as the compiler uses to calculate the value of a constant
expression, and may give different results in some cases.  If the value
comes out to be nonzero, the '#if' succeeds and the CONTROLLED TEXT is
included; otherwise it is skipped.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Defined,  Next: Else,  Prev: If,  Up: Conditional Syntax

4.2.3 Defined
-------------

The special operator 'defined' is used in '#if' and '#elif' expressions
to test whether a certain name is defined as a macro.  'defined NAME'
and 'defined (NAME)' are both expressions whose value is 1 if NAME is
defined as a macro at the current point in the program, and 0 otherwise.
Thus, '#if defined MACRO' is precisely equivalent to '#ifdef MACRO'.

   'defined' is useful when you wish to test more than one macro for
existence at once.  For example,

     #if defined (__vax__) || defined (__ns16000__)

would succeed if either of the names '__vax__' or '__ns16000__' is
defined as a macro.

   Conditionals written like this:

     #if defined BUFSIZE && BUFSIZE >= 1024

can generally be simplified to just '#if BUFSIZE >= 1024', since if
'BUFSIZE' is not defined, it will be interpreted as having the value
zero.

   If the 'defined' operator appears as a result of a macro expansion,
the C standard says the behavior is undefined.  GNU cpp treats it as a
genuine 'defined' operator and evaluates it normally.  It will warn
wherever your code uses this feature if you use the command-line option
'-pedantic', since other compilers may handle it differently.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Else,  Next: Elif,  Prev: Defined,  Up: Conditional Syntax

4.2.4 Else
----------

The '#else' directive can be added to a conditional to provide
alternative text to be used if the condition fails.  This is what it
looks like:

     #if EXPRESSION
     TEXT-IF-TRUE
     #else /* Not EXPRESSION */
     TEXT-IF-FALSE
     #endif /* Not EXPRESSION */

If EXPRESSION is nonzero, the TEXT-IF-TRUE is included and the
TEXT-IF-FALSE is skipped.  If EXPRESSION is zero, the opposite happens.

   You can use '#else' with '#ifdef' and '#ifndef', too.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Elif,  Prev: Else,  Up: Conditional Syntax

4.2.5 Elif
----------

One common case of nested conditionals is used to check for more than
two possible alternatives.  For example, you might have

     #if X == 1
     ...
     #else /* X != 1 */
     #if X == 2
     ...
     #else /* X != 2 */
     ...
     #endif /* X != 2 */
     #endif /* X != 1 */

   Another conditional directive, '#elif', allows this to be abbreviated
as follows:

     #if X == 1
     ...
     #elif X == 2
     ...
     #else /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
     ...
     #endif /* X != 2 and X != 1*/

   '#elif' stands for "else if".  Like '#else', it goes in the middle of
a conditional group and subdivides it; it does not require a matching
'#endif' of its own.  Like '#if', the '#elif' directive includes an
expression to be tested.  The text following the '#elif' is processed
only if the original '#if'-condition failed and the '#elif' condition
succeeds.

   More than one '#elif' can go in the same conditional group.  Then the
text after each '#elif' is processed only if the '#elif' condition
succeeds after the original '#if' and all previous '#elif' directives
within it have failed.

   '#else' is allowed after any number of '#elif' directives, but
'#elif' may not follow '#else'.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Deleted Code,  Prev: Conditional Syntax,  Up: Conditionals

4.3 Deleted Code
================

If you replace or delete a part of the program but want to keep the old
code around for future reference, you often cannot simply comment it
out.  Block comments do not nest, so the first comment inside the old
code will end the commenting-out.  The probable result is a flood of
syntax errors.

   One way to avoid this problem is to use an always-false conditional
instead.  For instance, put '#if 0' before the deleted code and '#endif'
after it.  This works even if the code being turned off contains
conditionals, but they must be entire conditionals (balanced '#if' and
'#endif').

   Some people use '#ifdef notdef' instead.  This is risky, because
'notdef' might be accidentally defined as a macro, and then the
conditional would succeed.  '#if 0' can be counted on to fail.

   Do not use '#if 0' for comments which are not C code.  Use a real
comment, instead.  The interior of '#if 0' must consist of complete
tokens; in particular, single-quote characters must balance.  Comments
often contain unbalanced single-quote characters (known in English as
apostrophes).  These confuse '#if 0'.  They don't confuse '/*'.

5 Diagnostics
*************

The directive '#error' causes the preprocessor to report a fatal error.
The tokens forming the rest of the line following '#error' are used as
the error message.

   You would use '#error' inside of a conditional that detects a
combination of parameters which you know the program does not properly
support.  For example, if you know that the program will not run
properly on a VAX, you might write

     #ifdef __vax__
     #error "Won't work on VAXen.  See comments at get_last_object."
     #endif

   If you have several configuration parameters that must be set up by
the installation in a consistent way, you can use conditionals to detect
an inconsistency and report it with '#error'.  For example,

     #if !defined(FOO) && defined(BAR)
     #error "BAR requires FOO."
     #endif

   The directive '#warning' is like '#error', but causes the
preprocessor to issue a warning and continue preprocessing.  The tokens
following '#warning' are used as the warning message.

   You might use '#warning' in obsolete header files, with a message
directing the user to the header file which should be used instead.

   Neither '#error' nor '#warning' macro-expands its argument.  Internal
whitespace sequences are each replaced with a single space.  The line
must consist of complete tokens.  It is wisest to make the argument of
these directives be a single string constant; this avoids problems with
apostrophes and the like.

6 Line Control
**************

The C preprocessor informs the C compiler of the location in your source
code where each token came from.  Presently, this is just the file name
and line number.  All the tokens resulting from macro expansion are
reported as having appeared on the line of the source file where the
outermost macro was used.  We intend to be more accurate in the future.

   If you write a program which generates source code, such as the
'bison' parser generator, you may want to adjust the preprocessor's
notion of the current file name and line number by hand.  Parts of the
output from 'bison' are generated from scratch, other parts come from a
standard parser file.  The rest are copied verbatim from 'bison''s
input.  You would like compiler error messages and symbolic debuggers to
be able to refer to 'bison''s input file.

   'bison' or any such program can arrange this by writing '#line'
directives into the output file.  '#line' is a directive that specifies
the original line number and source file name for subsequent input in
the current preprocessor input file.  '#line' has three variants:

'#line LINENUM'
     LINENUM is a non-negative decimal integer constant.  It specifies
     the line number which should be reported for the following line of
     input.  Subsequent lines are counted from LINENUM.

'#line LINENUM FILENAME'
     LINENUM is the same as for the first form, and has the same effect.
     In addition, FILENAME is a string constant.  The following line and
     all subsequent lines are reported to come from the file it
     specifies, until something else happens to change that.  FILENAME
     is interpreted according to the normal rules for a string constant:
     backslash escapes are interpreted.  This is different from
     '#include'.

     Previous versions of CPP did not interpret escapes in '#line'; we
     have changed it because the standard requires they be interpreted,
     and most other compilers do.

'#line ANYTHING ELSE'
     ANYTHING ELSE is checked for macro calls, which are expanded.  The
     result should match one of the above two forms.

   '#line' directives alter the results of the '__FILE__' and '__LINE__'
predefined macros from that point on.  *Note Standard Predefined
Macros::.  They do not have any effect on '#include''s idea of the
directory containing the current file.  This is a change from GCC 2.95.
Previously, a file reading

     #include "gram.h"

   would search for 'gram.h' in '../src', then the '-I' chain; the
directory containing the physical source file would not be searched.  In
GCC 3.0 and later, the '#include' is not affected by the presence of a
'#line' referring to a different directory.

   We made this change because the old behavior caused problems when
generated source files were transported between machines.  For instance,
it is common practice to ship generated parsers with a source release,
so that people building the distribution do not need to have yacc or
Bison installed.  These files frequently have '#line' directives
referring to the directory tree of the system where the distribution was
created.  If GCC tries to search for headers in those directories, the
build is likely to fail.

   The new behavior can cause failures too, if the generated file is not
in the same directory as its source and it attempts to include a header
which would be visible searching from the directory containing the
source file.  However, this problem is easily solved with an additional
'-I' switch on the command line.  The failures caused by the old
semantics could sometimes be corrected only by editing the generated
files, which is difficult and error-prone.

7 Pragmas
*********

The '#pragma' directive is the method specified by the C standard for
providing additional information to the compiler, beyond what is
conveyed in the language itself.  Three forms of this directive
(commonly known as "pragmas") are specified by the 1999 C standard.  A C
compiler is free to attach any meaning it likes to other pragmas.

   GCC has historically preferred to use extensions to the syntax of the
language, such as '__attribute__', for this purpose.  However, GCC does
define a few pragmas of its own.  These mostly have effects on the
entire translation unit or source file.

   In GCC version 3, all GNU-defined, supported pragmas have been given
a 'GCC' prefix.  This is in line with the 'STDC' prefix on all pragmas
defined by C99.  For backward compatibility, pragmas which were
recognized by previous versions are still recognized without the 'GCC'
prefix, but that usage is deprecated.  Some older pragmas are deprecated
in their entirety.  They are not recognized with the 'GCC' prefix.
*Note Obsolete Features::.

   C99 introduces the '_Pragma' operator.  This feature addresses a
major problem with '#pragma': being a directive, it cannot be produced
as the result of macro expansion.  '_Pragma' is an operator, much like
'sizeof' or 'defined', and can be embedded in a macro.

   Its syntax is '_Pragma (STRING-LITERAL)', where STRING-LITERAL can be
either a normal or wide-character string literal.  It is destringized,
by replacing all '\\' with a single '\' and all '\"' with a '"'.  The
result is then processed as if it had appeared as the right hand side of
a '#pragma' directive.  For example,

     _Pragma ("GCC dependency \"parse.y\"")

has the same effect as '#pragma GCC dependency "parse.y"'.  The same
effect could be achieved using macros, for example

     #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
     DO_PRAGMA (GCC dependency "parse.y")

   The standard is unclear on where a '_Pragma' operator can appear.
The preprocessor does not accept it within a preprocessing conditional
directive like '#if'.  To be safe, you are probably best keeping it out
of directives other than '#define', and putting it on a line of its own.

   This manual documents the pragmas which are meaningful to the
preprocessor itself.  Other pragmas are meaningful to the C or C++
compilers.  They are documented in the GCC manual.

   GCC plugins may provide their own pragmas.

'#pragma GCC dependency'
     '#pragma GCC dependency' allows you to check the relative dates of
     the current file and another file.  If the other file is more
     recent than the current file, a warning is issued.  This is useful
     if the current file is derived from the other file, and should be
     regenerated.  The other file is searched for using the normal
     include search path.  Optional trailing text can be used to give
     more information in the warning message.

          #pragma GCC dependency "parse.y"
          #pragma GCC dependency "/usr/include/time.h" rerun fixincludes

'#pragma GCC poison'
     Sometimes, there is an identifier that you want to remove
     completely from your program, and make sure that it never creeps
     back in.  To enforce this, you can "poison" the identifier with
     this pragma.  '#pragma GCC poison' is followed by a list of
     identifiers to poison.  If any of those identifiers appears
     anywhere in the source after the directive, it is a hard error.
     For example,

          #pragma GCC poison printf sprintf fprintf
          sprintf(some_string, "hello");

     will produce an error.

     If a poisoned identifier appears as part of the expansion of a
     macro which was defined before the identifier was poisoned, it will
     _not_ cause an error.  This lets you poison an identifier without
     worrying about system headers defining macros that use it.

     For example,

          #define strrchr rindex
          #pragma GCC poison rindex
          strrchr(some_string, 'h');

     will not produce an error.

'#pragma GCC system_header'
     This pragma takes no arguments.  It causes the rest of the code in
     the current file to be treated as if it came from a system header.
     *Note System Headers::.

'#pragma GCC warning'
'#pragma GCC error'
     '#pragma GCC warning "message"' causes the preprocessor to issue a
     warning diagnostic with the text 'message'.  The message contained
     in the pragma must be a single string literal.  Similarly, '#pragma
     GCC error "message"' issues an error message.  Unlike the
     '#warning' and '#error' directives, these pragmas can be embedded
     in preprocessor macros using '_Pragma'.

8 Other Directives
******************

The '#ident' directive takes one argument, a string constant.  On some
systems, that string constant is copied into a special segment of the
object file.  On other systems, the directive is ignored.  The '#sccs'
directive is a synonym for '#ident'.

   These directives are not part of the C standard, but they are not
official GNU extensions either.  What historical information we have
been able to find, suggests they originated with System V.

   The "null directive" consists of a '#' followed by a newline, with
only whitespace (including comments) in between.  A null directive is
understood as a preprocessing directive but has no effect on the
preprocessor output.  The primary significance of the existence of the
null directive is that an input line consisting of just a '#' will
produce no output, rather than a line of output containing just a '#'.
Supposedly some old C programs contain such lines.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Preprocessor Output,  Next: Traditional Mode,  Prev: Other Directives,  Up: Top

9 Preprocessor Output
*********************

When the C preprocessor is used with the C, C++, or Objective-C
compilers, it is integrated into the compiler and communicates a stream
of binary tokens directly to the compiler's parser.  However, it can
also be used in the more conventional standalone mode, where it produces
textual output.

   The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except
that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank
lines and all comments with spaces.  Long runs of blank lines are
discarded.

   The ISO standard specifies that it is implementation defined whether
a preprocessor preserves whitespace between tokens, or replaces it with
e.g. a single space.  In GNU CPP, whitespace between tokens is collapsed
to become a single space, with the exception that the first token on a
non-directive line is preceded with sufficient spaces that it appears in
the same column in the preprocessed output that it appeared in the
original source file.  This is so the output is easy to read.  *Note
Differences from previous versions::.  CPP does not insert any
whitespace where there was none in the original source, except where
necessary to prevent an accidental token paste.

   Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines of
the form

     # LINENUM FILENAME FLAGS

These are called "linemarkers".  They are inserted as needed into the
output (but never within a string or character constant).  They mean
that the following line originated in file FILENAME at line LINENUM.
FILENAME will never contain any non-printing characters; they are
replaced with octal escape sequences.

   After the file name comes zero or more flags, which are '1', '2',
'3', or '4'.  If there are multiple flags, spaces separate them.  Here
is what the flags mean:

'1'
     This indicates the start of a new file.
'2'
     This indicates returning to a file (after having included another
     file).
'3'
     This indicates that the following text comes from a system header
     file, so certain warnings should be suppressed.
'4'
     This indicates that the following text should be treated as being
     wrapped in an implicit 'extern "C"' block.

   As an extension, the preprocessor accepts linemarkers in
non-assembler input files.  They are treated like the corresponding
'#line' directive, (*note Line Control::), except that trailing flags
are permitted, and are interpreted with the meanings described above.
If multiple flags are given, they must be in ascending order.

   Some directives may be duplicated in the output of the preprocessor.
These are '#ident' (always), '#pragma' (only if the preprocessor does
not handle the pragma itself), and '#define' and '#undef' (with certain
debugging options).  If this happens, the '#' of the directive will
always be in the first column, and there will be no space between the
'#' and the directive name.  If macro expansion happens to generate
tokens which might be mistaken for a duplicated directive, a space will
be inserted between the '#' and the directive name.

10 Traditional Mode
*******************

Traditional (pre-standard) C preprocessing is rather different from the
preprocessing specified by the standard.  When GCC is given the
'-traditional-cpp' option, it attempts to emulate a traditional
preprocessor.

   GCC versions 3.2 and later only support traditional mode semantics in
the preprocessor, and not in the compiler front ends.  This chapter
outlines the traditional preprocessor semantics we implemented.

   The implementation does not correspond precisely to the behavior of
earlier versions of GCC, nor to any true traditional preprocessor.
After all, inconsistencies among traditional implementations were a
major motivation for C standardization.  However, we intend that it
should be compatible with true traditional preprocessors in all ways
that actually matter.

File: cpp.info,  Node: Traditional lexical analysis,  Next: Traditional macros,  Up: Traditional Mode

10.1 Traditional lexical analysis
=================================

The traditional preprocessor does not decompose its input into tokens
the same way a standards-conforming preprocessor does.  The input is
simply treated as a stream of text with minimal internal form.

   This implementation does not treat trigraphs (*note trigraphs::)
specially since they were an invention of the standards committee.  It
handles arbitrarily-positioned escaped newlines properly and splices the
lines as you would expect; many traditional preprocessors did not do
this.

   The form of horizontal whitespace in the input file is preserved in
the output.  In particular, hard tabs remain hard tabs.  This can be
useful if, for example, you are preprocessing a Makefile.

   Traditional CPP only recognizes C-style block comments, and treats
the '/*' sequence as introducing a comment only if it lies outside
quoted text.  Quoted text is introduced by the usual single and double
quotes, and also by an initial '<' in a '#include' directive.

   Traditionally, comments are completely removed and are not replaced
with a space.  Since a traditional compiler does its own tokenization of
the output of the preprocessor, this means that comments can effectively
be used as token paste operators.  However, comments behave like
separators for text handled by the preprocessor itself, since it doesn't
re-lex its input.  For example, in

     #if foo/**/bar

'foo' and 'bar' are distinct identifiers and expanded separately if they
happen to be macros.  In other words, this directive is equivalent to

     #if foo bar

rather than

     #if foobar

   Generally speaking, in traditional mode an opening quote need not
have a matching closing quote.  In particular, a macro may be defined
with replacement text that contains an unmatched quote.  Of course, if
you attempt to compile preprocessed output containing an unmatched quote
you will get a syntax error.

   However, all preprocessing directives other than '#define' require
matching quotes.  For example:

     #define m This macro's fine and has an unmatched quote
     "/* This is not a comment.  */
     /* This is a comment.  The following #include directive
        is ill-formed.  */
     #include <stdio.h

   Just as for the ISO preprocessor, what would be a closing quote can
be escaped with a backslash to prevent the quoted text from closing.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Traditional macros,  Next: Traditional miscellany,  Prev: Traditional lexical analysis,  Up: Traditional Mode

10.2 Traditional macros
=======================

The major difference between traditional and ISO macros is that the
former expand to text rather than to a token sequence.  CPP removes all
leading and trailing horizontal whitespace from a macro's replacement
text before storing it, but preserves the form of internal whitespace.

   One consequence is that it is legitimate for the replacement text to
contain an unmatched quote (*note Traditional lexical analysis::).  An
unclosed string or character constant continues into the text following
the macro call.  Similarly, the text at the end of a macro's expansion
can run together with the text after the macro invocation to produce a
single token.

   Normally comments are removed from the replacement text after the
macro is expanded, but if the '-CC' option is passed on the command line
comments are preserved.  (In fact, the current implementation removes
comments even before saving the macro replacement text, but it careful
to do it in such a way that the observed effect is identical even in the
function-like macro case.)

   The ISO stringification operator '#' and token paste operator '##'
have no special meaning.  As explained later, an effect similar to these
operators can be obtained in a different way.  Macro names that are
embedded in quotes, either from the main file or after macro
replacement, do not expand.

   CPP replaces an unquoted object-like macro name with its replacement
text, and then rescans it for further macros to replace.  Unlike
standard macro expansion, traditional macro expansion has no provision
to prevent recursion.  If an object-like macro appears unquoted in its
replacement text, it will be replaced again during the rescan pass, and
so on _ad infinitum_.  GCC detects when it is expanding recursive
macros, emits an error message, and continues after the offending macro
invocation.

     #define PLUS +
     #define INC(x) PLUS+x
     INC(foo);
          ==> ++foo;

   Function-like macros are similar in form but quite different in
behavior to their ISO counterparts.  Their arguments are contained
within parentheses, are comma-separated, and can cross physical lines.
Commas within nested parentheses are not treated as argument separators.
Similarly, a quote in an argument cannot be left unclosed; a following
comma or parenthesis that comes before the closing quote is treated like
any other character.  There is no facility for handling variadic macros.

   This implementation removes all comments from macro arguments, unless
the '-C' option is given.  The form of all other horizontal whitespace
in arguments is preserved, including leading and trailing whitespace.
In particular

     f( )

is treated as an invocation of the macro 'f' with a single argument
consisting of a single space.  If you want to invoke a function-like
macro that takes no arguments, you must not leave any whitespace between
the parentheses.

   If a macro argument crosses a new line, the new line is replaced with
a space when forming the argument.  If the previous line contained an
unterminated quote, the following line inherits the quoted state.

   Traditional preprocessors replace parameters in the replacement text
with their arguments regardless of whether the parameters are within
quotes or not.  This provides a way to stringize arguments.  For example

     #define str(x) "x"
     str(/* A comment */some text )
          ==> "some text "

Note that the comment is removed, but that the trailing space is
preserved.  Here is an example of using a comment to effect token
pasting.

     #define suffix(x) foo_/**/x
     suffix(bar)
          ==> foo_bar

10.3 Traditional miscellany
===========================

Here are some things to be aware of when using the traditional
preprocessor.

   * Preprocessing directives are recognized only when their leading '#'
     appears in the first column.  There can be no whitespace between
     the beginning of the line and the '#', but whitespace can follow
     the '#'.

   * A true traditional C preprocessor does not recognize '#error' or
     '#pragma', and may not recognize '#elif'.  CPP supports all the
     directives in traditional mode that it supports in ISO mode,
     including extensions, with the exception that the effects of
     '#pragma GCC poison' are undefined.

   * __STDC__ is not defined.

   * If you use digraphs the behavior is undefined.

   * If a line that looks like a directive appears within macro
     arguments, the behavior is undefined.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Traditional warnings,  Prev: Traditional miscellany,  Up: Traditional Mode

10.4 Traditional warnings
=========================

You can request warnings about features that did not exist, or worked
differently, in traditional C with the '-Wtraditional' option.  GCC does
not warn about features of ISO C which you must use when you are using a
conforming compiler, such as the '#' and '##' operators.

   Presently '-Wtraditional' warns about:

   * Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro
     body.  In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string
     literals, but does not in ISO C.

   * In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
     Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a
     directive if the '#' appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
     '-Wtraditional' warns about directives that traditional C
     understands but would ignore because the '#' does not appear as the
     first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives
     like '#pragma' not understood by traditional C by indenting them.
     Some traditional implementations would not recognize '#elif', so it
     suggests avoiding it altogether.

   * A function-like macro that appears without an argument list.  In
     some traditional preprocessors this was an error.  In ISO C it
     merely means that the macro is not expanded.

   * The unary plus operator.  This did not exist in traditional C.

   * The 'U' and 'LL' integer constant suffixes, which were not
     available in traditional C.  (Traditional C does support the 'L'
     suffix for simple long integer constants.)  You are not warned
     about uses of these suffixes in macros defined in system headers.
     For instance, 'UINT_MAX' may well be defined as '4294967295U', but
     you will not be warned if you use 'UINT_MAX'.

     You can usually avoid the warning, and the related warning about
     constants which are so large that they are unsigned, by writing the
     integer constant in question in hexadecimal, with no U suffix.
     Take care, though, because this gives the wrong result in exotic
     cases.

11 Implementation Details
*************************

Here we document details of how the preprocessor's implementation
affects its user-visible behavior.  You should try to avoid undue
reliance on behavior described here, as it is possible that it will
change subtly in future implementations.

   Also documented here are obsolete features and changes from previous
versions of CPP.

* Menu:

* Implementation-defined behavior::
* Implementation limits::
* Obsolete Features::
* Differences from previous versions::


File: cpp.info,  Node: Implementation-defined behavior,  Next: Implementation limits,  Up: Implementation Details

11.1 Implementation-defined behavior
====================================

This is how CPP behaves in all the cases which the C standard describes
as "implementation-defined".  This term means that the implementation is
free to do what it likes, but must document its choice and stick to it.

   * The mapping of physical source file multi-byte characters to the
     execution character set.

     The input character set can be specified using the
     '-finput-charset' option, while the execution character set may be
     controlled using the '-fexec-charset' and '-fwide-exec-charset'
     options.

   * Identifier characters.

     The C and C++ standards allow identifiers to be composed of '_' and
     the alphanumeric characters.  C++ and C99 also allow universal
     character names, and C99 further permits implementation-defined
     characters.  GCC currently only permits universal character names
     if '-fextended-identifiers' is used, because the implementation of
     universal character names in identifiers is experimental.

     GCC allows the '$' character in identifiers as an extension for
     most targets.  This is true regardless of the 'std=' switch, since
     this extension cannot conflict with standards-conforming programs.
     When preprocessing assembler, however, dollars are not identifier
     characters by default.

     Currently the targets that by default do not permit '$' are AVR,
     IP2K, MMIX, MIPS Irix 3, ARM aout, and PowerPC targets for the AIX
     operating system.

     You can override the default with '-fdollars-in-identifiers' or
     'fno-dollars-in-identifiers'.  *Note fdollars-in-identifiers::.

   * Non-empty sequences of whitespace characters.

     In textual output, each whitespace sequence is collapsed to a
     single space.  For aesthetic reasons, the first token on each
     non-directive line of output is preceded with sufficient spaces
     that it appears in the same column as it did in the original source
     file.

   * The numeric value of character constants in preprocessor
     expressions.

     The preprocessor and compiler interpret character constants in the
     same way; i.e. escape sequences such as '\a' are given the values
     they would have on the target machine.

     The compiler evaluates a multi-character character constant a
     character at a time, shifting the previous value left by the number
     of bits per target character, and then or-ing in the bit-pattern of
     the new character truncated to the width of a target character.
     The final bit-pattern is given type 'int', and is therefore signed,
     regardless of whether single characters are signed or not (a slight
     change from versions 3.1 and earlier of GCC).  If there are more
     characters in the constant than would fit in the target 'int' the
     compiler issues a warning, and the excess leading characters are
     ignored.

     For example, ''ab'' for a target with an 8-bit 'char' would be
     interpreted as
     '(int) ((unsigned char) 'a' * 256 + (unsigned char) 'b')', and
     ''\234a'' as
     '(int) ((unsigned char) '\234' * 256 + (unsigned char) 'a')'.

   * Source file inclusion.

     For a discussion on how the preprocessor locates header files,
     *note Include Operation::.

   * Interpretation of the filename resulting from a macro-expanded
     '#include' directive.

     *Note Computed Includes::.

   * Treatment of a '#pragma' directive that after macro-expansion
     results in a standard pragma.

     No macro expansion occurs on any '#pragma' directive line, so the
     question does not arise.

     Note that GCC does not yet implement any of the standard pragmas.


File: cpp.info,  Node: Implementation limits,  Next: Obsolete Features,  Prev: Implementation-defined behavior,  Up: Implementation Details

11.2 Implementation limits
==========================

CPP has a small number of internal limits.  This section lists the
limits which the C standard requires to be no lower than some minimum,
and all the others known.  It is intended that there should be as few
limits as possible.  If you encounter an undocumented or inconvenient
limit, please report that as a bug.  *Note Reporting Bugs: (gcc)Bugs.

   Where we say something is limited "only by available memory", that
means that internal data structures impose no intrinsic limit, and space
is allocated with 'malloc' or equivalent.  The actual limit will
therefore depend on many things, such as the size of other things
allocated by the compiler at the same time, the amount of memory
consumed by other processes on the same computer, etc.

   * Nesting levels of '#include' files.

     We impose an arbitrary limit of 200 levels, to avoid runaway
     recursion.  The standard requires at least 15 levels.

   * Nesting levels of conditional inclusion.

     The C standard mandates this be at least 63.  CPP is limited only
     by available memory.

   * Levels of parenthesized expressions within a full expression.

     The C standard requires this to be at least 63.  In preprocessor
     conditional expressions, it is limited only by available memory.

   * Significant initial characters in an identifier or macro name.

     The preprocessor treats all characters as significant.  The C
     standard requires only that the first 63 be significant.

   * Number of macros simultaneously defined in a single translation
     unit.

     The standard requires at least 4095 be possible.  CPP is limited
     only by available memory.

   * Number of parameters in a macro definition and arguments in a macro
     call.

     We allow 'USHRT_MAX', which is no smaller than 65,535.  The minimum
     required by the standard is 127.

   * Number of characters on a logical source line.

     The C standard requires a minimum of 4096 be permitted.  CPP places
     no limits on this, but you may get incorrect column numbers
     reported in diagnostics for lines longer than 65,535 characters.

   * Maximum size of a source file.

     The standard does not specify any lower limit on the maximum size
     of a source file.  GNU cpp maps files into memory, so it is limited
     by the available address space.  This is generally at least two
     gigabytes.  Depending on the operating system, the size of physical
     memory may or may not be a limitation.

11.3 Obsolete Features
======================

CPP has some features which are present mainly for compatibility with
older programs.  We discourage their use in new code.  In some cases, we
plan to remove the feature in a future version of GCC.

11.3.1 Assertions
-----------------

"Assertions" are a deprecated alternative to macros in writing
conditionals to test what sort of computer or system the compiled
program will run on.  Assertions are usually predefined, but you can
define them with preprocessing directives or command-line options.

   Assertions were intended to provide a more systematic way to describe
the compiler's target system and we added them for compatibility with
existing compilers.  In practice they are just as unpredictable as the
system-specific predefined macros.  In addition, they are not part of
any standard, and only a few compilers support them.  Therefore, the use
of assertions is *less* portable than the use of system-specific
predefined macros.  We recommend you do not use them at all.

   An assertion looks like this:

     #PREDICATE (ANSWER)

PREDICATE must be a single identifier.  ANSWER can be any sequence of
tokens; all characters are significant except for leading and trailing
whitespace, and differences in internal whitespace sequences are
ignored.  (This is similar to the rules governing macro redefinition.)
Thus, '(x + y)' is different from '(x+y)' but equivalent to '( x + y )'.
Parentheses do not nest inside an answer.

   To test an assertion, you write it in an '#if'.  For example, this
conditional succeeds if either 'vax' or 'ns16000' has been asserted as
an answer for 'machine'.

     #if #machine (vax) || #machine (ns16000)

You can test whether _any_ answer is asserted for a predicate by
omitting the answer in the conditional:

     #if #machine

   Assertions are made with the '#assert' directive.  Its sole argument
is the assertion to make, without the leading '#' that identifies
assertions in conditionals.

     #assert PREDICATE (ANSWER)

You may make several assertions with the same predicate and different
answers.  Subsequent assertions do not override previous ones for the
same predicate.  All the answers for any given predicate are
simultaneously true.

   Assertions can be canceled with the '#unassert' directive.  It has
the same syntax as '#assert'.  In that form it cancels only the answer
which was specified on the '#unassert' line; other answers for that
predicate remain true.  You can cancel an entire predicate by leaving
out the answer:

     #unassert PREDICATE

In either form, if no such assertion has been made, '#unassert' has no
effect.

   You can also make or cancel assertions using command line options.

11.4 Differences from previous versions
=======================================

This section details behavior which has changed from previous versions
of CPP.  We do not plan to change it again in the near future, but we do
not promise not to, either.

   The "previous versions" discussed here are 2.95 and before.  The
behavior of GCC 3.0 is mostly the same as the behavior of the widely
used 2.96 and 2.97 development snapshots.  Where there are differences,
they generally represent bugs in the snapshots.

   * -I- deprecated

     This option has been deprecated in 4.0.  '-iquote' is meant to
     replace the need for this option.

   * Order of evaluation of '#' and '##' operators

     The standard does not specify the order of evaluation of a chain of
     '##' operators, nor whether '#' is evaluated before, after, or at
     the same time as '##'.  You should therefore not write any code
     which depends on any specific ordering.  It is possible to
     guarantee an ordering, if you need one, by suitable use of nested
     macros.

     An example of where this might matter is pasting the arguments '1',
     'e' and '-2'.  This would be fine for left-to-right pasting, but
     right-to-left pasting would produce an invalid token 'e-2'.

     GCC 3.0 evaluates '#' and '##' at the same time and strictly left
     to right.  Older versions evaluated all '#' operators first, then
     all '##' operators, in an unreliable order.

   * The form of whitespace between tokens in preprocessor output

     *Note Preprocessor Output::, for the current textual format.  This
     is also the format used by stringification.  Normally, the
     preprocessor communicates tokens directly to the compiler's parser,
     and whitespace does not come up at all.

     Older versions of GCC preserved all whitespace provided by the user
     and inserted lots more whitespace of their own, because they could
     not accurately predict when extra spaces were needed to prevent
     accidental token pasting.

   * Optional argument when invoking rest argument macros

     As an extension, GCC permits you to omit the variable arguments
     entirely when you use a variable argument macro.  This is forbidden
     by the 1999 C standard, and will provoke a pedantic warning with
     GCC 3.0.  Previous versions accepted it silently.

   * '##' swallowing preceding text in rest argument macros

     Formerly, in a macro expansion, if '##' appeared before a variable
     arguments parameter, and the set of tokens specified for that
     argument in the macro invocation was empty, previous versions of
     CPP would back up and remove the preceding sequence of
     non-whitespace characters (*not* the preceding token).  This
     extension is in direct conflict with the 1999 C standard and has
     been drastically pared back.

     In the current version of the preprocessor, if '##' appears between
     a comma and a variable arguments parameter, and the variable
     argument is omitted entirely, the comma will be removed from the
     expansion.  If the variable argument is empty, or the token before
     '##' is not a comma, then '##' behaves as a normal token paste.

   * '#line' and '#include'

     The '#line' directive used to change GCC's notion of the "directory
     containing the current file", used by '#include' with a
     double-quoted header file name.  In 3.0 and later, it does not.
     *Note Line Control::, for further explanation.

   * Syntax of '#line'

     In GCC 2.95 and previous, the string constant argument to '#line'
     was treated the same way as the argument to '#include': backslash
     escapes were not honored, and the string ended at the second '"'.
     This is not compliant with the C standard.  In GCC 3.0, an attempt
     was made to correct the behavior, so that the string was treated as
     a real string constant, but it turned out to be buggy.  In 3.1, the
     bugs have been fixed.  (We are not fixing the bugs in 3.0 because
     they affect relatively few people and the fix is quite invasive.)

12 Invocation
*************

Most often when you use the C preprocessor you will not have to invoke
it explicitly: the C compiler will do so automatically.  However, the
preprocessor is sometimes useful on its own.  All the options listed
here are also acceptable to the C compiler and have the same meaning,
except that the C compiler has different rules for specifying the output
file.

   _Note:_ Whether you use the preprocessor by way of 'gcc' or 'cpp',
the "compiler driver" is run first.  This program's purpose is to
translate your command into invocations of the programs that do the
actual work.  Their command line interfaces are similar but not
identical to the documented interface, and may change without notice.

   The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, INFILE and
OUTFILE.  The preprocessor reads INFILE together with any other files it
specifies with '#include'.  All the output generated by the combined
input files is written in OUTFILE.

   Either INFILE or OUTFILE may be '-', which as INFILE means to read
from standard input and as OUTFILE means to write to standard output.
Also, if either file is omitted, it means the same as if '-' had been
specified for that file.

   Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in '=', all options which
take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately after
the option, or with a space between option and argument: '-Ifoo' and '-I
foo' have the same effect.

   Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple
single-letter options may _not_ be grouped: '-dM' is very different from
'-d -M'.

'-D NAME'
     Predefine NAME as a macro, with definition '1'.

'-D NAME=DEFINITION'
     The contents of DEFINITION are tokenized and processed as if they
     appeared during translation phase three in a '#define' directive.
     In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline
     characters.

     If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
     program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
     characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

     If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line,
     write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the
     equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells,
     so you will need to quote the option.  With 'sh' and 'csh',
     '-D'NAME(ARGS...)=DEFINITION'' works.

     '-D' and '-U' options are processed in the order they are given on
     the command line.  All '-imacros FILE' and '-include FILE' options
     are processed after all '-D' and '-U' options.

'-U NAME'
     Cancel any previous definition of NAME, either built in or provided
     with a '-D' option.

'-undef'
     Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
     standard predefined macros remain defined.  *Note Standard
     Predefined Macros::.

'-I DIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
     header files.  *Note Search Path::.  Directories named by '-I' are
     searched before the standard system include directories.  If the
     directory DIR is a standard system include directory, the option is
     ignored to ensure that the default search order for system
     directories and the special treatment of system headers are not
     defeated (*note System Headers::) .  If DIR begins with '=', then
     the '=' will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see '--sysroot' and
     '-isysroot'.

'-o FILE'
     Write output to FILE.  This is the same as specifying FILE as the
     second non-option argument to 'cpp'.  'gcc' has a different
     interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must use
     '-o' to specify the output file.

'-Wall'
     Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
     At present this is '-Wcomment', '-Wtrigraphs', '-Wmultichar' and a
     warning about integer promotion causing a change of sign in '#if'
     expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on
     by default and have no options to control them.

'-Wcomment'
'-Wcomments'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence '/*' appears in a '/*'
     comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a '//' comment.
     (Both forms have the same effect.)

'-Wtrigraphs'
     Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the
     program.  However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline
     ('??/' at the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment
     begins or ends.  Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped
     newlines produce warnings inside a comment.

     This option is implied by '-Wall'.  If '-Wall' is not given, this
     option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get
     trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other '-Wall'
     warnings, use '-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs'.

'-Wtraditional'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have
     no traditional C equivalent, and problematic constructs which
     should be avoided.  *Note Traditional Mode::.

'-Wundef'
     Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in
     an '#if' directive, outside of 'defined'.  Such identifiers are
     replaced with zero.

'-Wunused-macros'
     Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A
     macro is "used" if it is expanded or tested for existence at least
     once.  The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been
     used at the time it is redefined or undefined.

     Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
     defined in include files are not warned about.

     _Note:_ If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
     conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid
     the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the
     macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first
     skipped block.  Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with
     something like:

          #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
          #endif

'-Wendif-labels'
     Warn whenever an '#else' or an '#endif' are followed by text.  This
     usually happens in code of the form

          #if FOO
          ...
          #else FOO
          ...
          #endif FOO

     The second and third 'FOO' should be in comments, but often are not
     in older programs.  This warning is on by default.

'-Werror'
     Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers
     warnings will be rejected.

'-Wsystem-headers'
     Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally
     unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.
     If you are responsible for the system library, you may want to see
     them.

'-w'
     Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by
     default.

'-pedantic'
     Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some
     of them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on
     harmless code.

'-pedantic-errors'
     Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory
     diagnostics into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that
     GCC issues without '-pedantic' but treats as warnings.

'-M'
     Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
     suitable for 'make' describing the dependencies of the main source
     file.  The preprocessor outputs one 'make' rule containing the
     object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of
     all the included files, including those coming from '-include' or
     '-imacros' command line options.

     Unless specified explicitly (with '-MT' or '-MQ'), the object file
     name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix
     replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
     parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
     split into several lines using '\'-newline.  The rule has no
     commands.

     This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such
     as '-dM'.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
     rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
     '-MF', or use an environment variable like 'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT'
     (*note Environment Variables::).  Debug output will still be sent
     to the regular output stream as normal.

     Passing '-M' to the driver implies '-E', and suppresses warnings
     with an implicit '-w'.

'-MM'
     Like '-M' but do not mention header files that are found in system
     header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or
     indirectly, from such a header.

     This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in
     an '#include' directive does not in itself determine whether that
     header will appear in '-MM' dependency output.  This is a slight
     change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

'-MF FILE'
     When used with '-M' or '-MM', specifies a file to write the
     dependencies to.  If no '-MF' switch is given the preprocessor
     sends the rules to the same place it would have sent preprocessed
     output.

     When used with the driver options '-MD' or '-MMD', '-MF' overrides
     the default dependency output file.

'-MG'
     In conjunction with an option such as '-M' requesting dependency
     generation, '-MG' assumes missing header files are generated files
     and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error.  The
     dependency filename is taken directly from the '#include' directive
     without prepending any path.  '-MG' also suppresses preprocessed
     output, as a missing header file renders this useless.

     This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

'-MP'
     This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
     other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
     dummy rules work around errors 'make' gives if you remove header
     files without updating the 'Makefile' to match.

     This is typical output:

          test.o: test.c test.h

          test.h:

'-MT TARGET'

     Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
     default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
     directory components and any file suffix such as '.c', and appends
     the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

     An '-MT' option will set the target to be exactly the string you
     specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a
     single argument to '-MT', or use multiple '-MT' options.

     For example, '-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'' might give

          $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

'-MQ TARGET'

     Same as '-MT', but it quotes any characters which are special to
     Make.  '-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'' gives

          $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

     The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given
     with '-MQ'.

'-MD'
     '-MD' is equivalent to '-M -MF FILE', except that '-E' is not
     implied.  The driver determines FILE based on whether an '-o'
     option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a
     suffix of '.d', otherwise it takes the name of the input file,
     removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a '.d'
     suffix.

     If '-MD' is used in conjunction with '-E', any '-o' switch is
     understood to specify the dependency output file (*note -MF:
     dashMF.), but if used without '-E', each '-o' is understood to
     specify a target object file.

     Since '-E' is not implied, '-MD' can be used to generate a
     dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

'-MMD'
     Like '-MD' except mention only user header files, not system header
     files.

'-x c'
'-x c++'
'-x objective-c'
'-x assembler-with-cpp'
     Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.
     This has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it
     merely selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of
     these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension of
     the source file: '.c', '.cc', '.m', or '.S'.  Some other common
     extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does
     not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is
     the most generic mode.

     _Note:_ Previous versions of cpp accepted a '-lang' option which
     selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
     This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the '-l'
     option.

'-std=STANDARD'
'-ansi'
     Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently
     CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be added in the
     future.

     STANDARD may be one of:
     'c90'
     'c89'
     'iso9899:1990'
          The ISO C standard from 1990.  'c90' is the customary
          shorthand for this version of the standard.

          The '-ansi' option is equivalent to '-std=c90'.

     'iso9899:199409'
          The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.

     'iso9899:1999'
     'c99'
     'iso9899:199x'
     'c9x'
          The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.
          Before publication, this was known as C9X.

     'iso9899:2011'
     'c11'
     'c1x'
          The revised ISO C standard, published in December 2011.
          Before publication, this was known as C1X.

     'gnu90'
     'gnu89'
          The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.

     'gnu99'
     'gnu9x'
          The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.

     'gnu11'
     'gnu1x'
          The 2011 C standard plus GNU extensions.

     'c++98'
          The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

     'gnu++98'
          The same as '-std=c++98' plus GNU extensions.  This is the
          default for C++ code.

'-I-'
     Split the include path.  Any directories specified with '-I'
     options before '-I-' are searched only for headers requested with
     '#include "FILE"'; they are not searched for '#include <FILE>'.  If
     additional directories are specified with '-I' options after the
     '-I-', those directories are searched for all '#include'
     directives.

     In addition, '-I-' inhibits the use of the directory of the current
     file directory as the first search directory for '#include "FILE"'.
     *Note Search Path::.  This option has been deprecated.

'-nostdinc'
     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
     Only the directories you have specified with '-I' options (and the
     directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

'-nostdinc++'
     Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
     directories, but do still search the other standard directories.
     (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

'-include FILE'
     Process FILE as if '#include "file"' appeared as the first line of
     the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched for
     FILE is the preprocessor's working directory _instead of_ the
     directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
     is searched for in the remainder of the '#include "..."' search
     chain as normal.

     If multiple '-include' options are given, the files are included in
     the order they appear on the command line.

'-imacros FILE'
     Exactly like '-include', except that any output produced by
     scanning FILE is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
     This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without
     also processing its declarations.

     All files specified by '-imacros' are processed before all files
     specified by '-include'.

'-idirafter DIR'
     Search DIR for header files, but do it _after_ all directories
     specified with '-I' and the standard system directories have been
     exhausted.  DIR is treated as a system include directory.  If DIR
     begins with '=', then the '=' will be replaced by the sysroot
     prefix; see '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-iprefix PREFIX'
     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent '-iwithprefix' options.
     If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the final
     '/'.

'-iwithprefix DIR'
'-iwithprefixbefore DIR'
     Append DIR to the prefix specified previously with '-iprefix', and
     add the resulting directory to the include search path.
     '-iwithprefixbefore' puts it in the same place '-I' would;
     '-iwithprefix' puts it where '-idirafter' would.

'-isysroot DIR'
     This option is like the '--sysroot' option, but applies only to
     header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both
     header files and libraries).  See the '--sysroot' option for more
     information.

'-imultilib DIR'
     Use DIR as a subdirectory of the directory containing
     target-specific C++ headers.

'-isystem DIR'
     Search DIR for header files, after all directories specified by
     '-I' but before the standard system directories.  Mark it as a
     system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is
     applied to the standard system directories.  *Note System
     Headers::.  If DIR begins with '=', then the '=' will be replaced
     by the sysroot prefix; see '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-iquote DIR'
     Search DIR only for header files requested with '#include "FILE"';
     they are not searched for '#include <FILE>', before all directories
     specified by '-I' and before the standard system directories.
     *Note Search Path::.  If DIR begins with '=', then the '=' will be
     replaced by the sysroot prefix; see '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-fdirectives-only'
     When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

     The option's behavior depends on the '-E' and '-fpreprocessed'
     options.

     With '-E', preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
     such as '#define', '#ifdef', and '#error'.  Other preprocessor
     operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
     performed.  In addition, the '-dD' option is implicitly enabled.

     With '-fpreprocessed', predefinition of command line and most
     builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as '__LINE__', which are
     contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables
     compilation of files previously preprocessed with '-E
     -fdirectives-only'.

     With both '-E' and '-fpreprocessed', the rules for '-fpreprocessed'
     take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files
     previously preprocessed with '-E -fdirectives-only'.

'-fdollars-in-identifiers'
     Accept '$' in identifiers.  *Note Identifier characters::.

'-fextended-identifiers'
     Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
     experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by
     default for C99 and C++.

'-fno-canonical-system-headers'
     When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with
     canonicalization.

'-fpreprocessed'
     Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
     preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion,
     trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of
     most directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes
     comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with '-C' to the
     compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated
     preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.

     '-fpreprocessed' is implicit if the input file has one of the
     extensions '.i', '.ii' or '.mi'.  These are the extensions that GCC
     uses for preprocessed files created by '-save-temps'.

'-ftabstop=WIDTH'
     Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor
     report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs
     appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than
     100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.

'-fdebug-cpp'
     This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used with '-E',
     dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every token in
     the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location belongs
     to.  The dump of the map holding the location of a token would be:
          {'P':/file/path;'F':/includer/path;'L':LINE_NUM;'C':COL_NUM;'S':SYSTEM_HEADER_P;'M':MAP_ADDRESS;'E':MACRO_EXPANSION_P,'loc':LOCATION}

     When used without '-E', this option has no effect.

'-ftrack-macro-expansion[=LEVEL]'
     Track locations of tokens across macro expansions.  This allows the
     compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
     when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion.  Using this
     option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory.
     The LEVEL parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of
     token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
     necessary.  Value '0' of LEVEL de-activates this option just as if
     no '-ftrack-macro-expansion' was present on the command line.
     Value '1' tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake
     of minimal memory overhead.  In this mode all tokens resulting from
     the expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the same
     location.  Value '2' tracks tokens locations completely.  This
     value is the most memory hungry.  When this option is given no
     argument, the default parameter value is '2'.

     Note that -ftrack-macro-expansion=2 is activated by default.

'-fexec-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the execution character set, used for string and character
     constants.  The default is UTF-8.  CHARSET can be any encoding
     supported by the system's 'iconv' library routine.

'-fwide-exec-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
     character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
     corresponds to the width of 'wchar_t'.  As with '-fexec-charset',
     CHARSET can be any encoding supported by the system's 'iconv'
     library routine; however, you will have problems with encodings
     that do not fit exactly in 'wchar_t'.

'-finput-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the input character set, used for translation from the
     character set of the input file to the source character set used by
     GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this
     information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be
     overridden by either the locale or this command line option.
     Currently the command line option takes precedence if there's a
     conflict.  CHARSET can be any encoding supported by the system's
     'iconv' library routine.

'-fworking-directory'
     Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
     will let the compiler know the current working directory at the
     time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the
     preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second
     linemarker with the current working directory followed by two
     slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it's present in the
     preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working
     directory in some debugging information formats.  This option is
     implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this
     can be inhibited with the negated form '-fno-working-directory'.
     If the '-P' flag is present in the command line, this option has no
     effect, since no '#line' directives are emitted whatsoever.

'-fno-show-column'
     Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary
     if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not
     understand the column numbers, such as 'dejagnu'.

'-A PREDICATE=ANSWER'
     Make an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.
     This form is preferred to the older form '-A PREDICATE(ANSWER)',
     which is still supported, because it does not use shell special
     characters.  *Note Obsolete Features::.

'-A -PREDICATE=ANSWER'
     Cancel an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.

'-dCHARS'
     CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and
     must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted
     by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and
     so are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior
     conflicts, the result is undefined.

     'M'
          Instead of the normal output, generate a list of '#define'
          directives for all the macros defined during the execution of
          the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you
          a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the
          preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file 'foo.h', the command

               touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

          will show all the predefined macros.

          If you use '-dM' without the '-E' option, '-dM' is interpreted
          as a synonym for '-fdump-rtl-mach'.  *Note (gcc)Debugging
          Options::.

     'D'
          Like 'M' except in two respects: it does _not_ include the
          predefined macros, and it outputs _both_ the '#define'
          directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of
          output go to the standard output file.

     'N'
          Like 'D', but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

     'I'
          Output '#include' directives in addition to the result of
          preprocessing.

     'U'
          Like 'D' except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
          definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output;
          the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
          '#undef' directives are also output for macros tested but
          undefined at the time.

'-P'
     Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the
     preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the preprocessor
     on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program
     which might be confused by the linemarkers.  *Note Preprocessor
     Output::.

'-C'
     Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the
     output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are
     deleted along with the directive.

     You should be prepared for side effects when using '-C'; it causes
     the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
     For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
     directive line have the effect of turning that line into an
     ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no
     longer a '#'.

'-CC'
     Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
     like '-C', except that comments contained within macros are also
     passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

     In addition to the side-effects of the '-C' option, the '-CC'
     option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted
     to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use of that macro
     from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.

     The '-CC' option is generally used to support lint comments.

'-traditional-cpp'
     Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
     opposed to ISO C preprocessors.  *Note Traditional Mode::.

'-trigraphs'
     Process trigraph sequences.  *Note Initial processing::.

'-remap'
     Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit
     very short file names, such as MS-DOS.

'--help'
'--target-help'
     Print text describing all the command line options instead of
     preprocessing anything.

'-v'
     Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP's version number at the beginning
     of execution, and report the final form of the include path.

'-H'
     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
     normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
     '#include' stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also printed,
     even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header
     file is printed with '...x' and a valid one with '...!' .

'-version'
'--version'
     Print out GNU CPP's version number.  With one dash, proceed to
     preprocess as normal.  With two dashes, exit immediately.

13 Environment Variables
************************

This section describes the environment variables that affect how CPP
operates.  You can use them to specify directories or prefixes to use
when searching for include files, or to control dependency output.

   Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
'-I', and control dependency output with options like '-M' (*note
Invocation::).  These take precedence over environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over the configuration of GCC.

'CPATH'
'C_INCLUDE_PATH'
'CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH'
'OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH'
     Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a
     special character, much like 'PATH', in which to look for header
     files.  The special character, 'PATH_SEPARATOR', is
     target-dependent and determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft
     Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other
     targets it is a colon.

     'CPATH' specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
     specified with '-I', but after any paths given with '-I' options on
     the command line.  This environment variable is used regardless of
     which language is being preprocessed.

     The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing
     the particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of
     directories to be searched as if specified with '-isystem', but
     after any paths given with '-isystem' options on the command line.

     In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
     search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at
     the beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
     'CPATH' is ':/special/include', that has the same effect as
     '-I. -I/special/include'.

     See also *note Search Path::.

'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT'
     If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
     dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files
     processed by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the
     dependency output.

     The value of 'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' can be just a file name, in
     which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the
     target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the
     form 'FILE TARGET', in which case the rules are written to file
     FILE using TARGET as the target name.

     In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to
     combining the options '-MM' and '-MF' (*note Invocation::), with an
     optional '-MT' switch too.

'SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES'
     This variable is the same as 'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' (see above),
     except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies '-M'
     rather than '-MM'.  However, the dependence on the main input file
     is omitted.  *Note Invocation::.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

The GNU C Preprocessor Internals
********************************

1 Cpplib--the GNU C Preprocessor
********************************

The GNU C preprocessor is implemented as a library, "cpplib", so it can
be easily shared between a stand-alone preprocessor, and a preprocessor
integrated with the C, C++ and Objective-C front ends.  It is also
available for use by other programs, though this is not recommended as
its exposed interface has not yet reached a point of reasonable
stability.

   The library has been written to be re-entrant, so that it can be used
to preprocess many files simultaneously if necessary.  It has also been
written with the preprocessing token as the fundamental unit; the
preprocessor in previous versions of GCC would operate on text strings
as the fundamental unit.

   This brief manual documents the internals of cpplib, and explains
some of the tricky issues.  It is intended that, along with the comments
in the source code, a reasonably competent C programmer should be able
to figure out what the code is doing, and why things have been
implemented the way they have.

Conventions
***********

cpplib has two interfaces--one is exposed internally only, and the other
is for both internal and external use.

   The convention is that functions and types that are exposed to
multiple files internally are prefixed with '_cpp_', and are to be found
in the file 'internal.h'.  Functions and types exposed to external
clients are in 'cpplib.h', and prefixed with 'cpp_'.  For historical
reasons this is no longer quite true, but we should strive to stick to
it.

   We are striving to reduce the information exposed in 'cpplib.h' to
the bare minimum necessary, and then to keep it there.  This makes clear
exactly what external clients are entitled to assume, and allows us to
change internals in the future without worrying whether library clients
are perhaps relying on some kind of undocumented implementation-specific
behavior.

The Lexer
*********

Overview
========

The lexer is contained in the file 'lex.c'.  It is a hand-coded lexer,
and not implemented as a state machine.  It can understand C, C++ and
Objective-C source code, and has been extended to allow reasonably
successful preprocessing of assembly language.  The lexer does not make
an initial pass to strip out trigraphs and escaped newlines, but handles
them as they are encountered in a single pass of the input file.  It
returns preprocessing tokens individually, not a line at a time.

   It is mostly transparent to users of the library, since the library's
interface for obtaining the next token, 'cpp_get_token', takes care of
lexing new tokens, handling directives, and expanding macros as
necessary.  However, the lexer does expose some functionality so that
clients of the library can easily spell a given token, such as
'cpp_spell_token' and 'cpp_token_len'.  These functions are useful when
generating diagnostics, and for emitting the preprocessed output.

Lexing a token
==============

Lexing of an individual token is handled by '_cpp_lex_direct' and its
subroutines.  In its current form the code is quite complicated, with
read ahead characters and such-like, since it strives to not step back
in the character stream in preparation for handling non-ASCII file
encodings.  The current plan is to convert any such files to UTF-8
before processing them.  This complexity is therefore unnecessary and
will be removed, so I'll not discuss it further here.

   The job of '_cpp_lex_direct' is simply to lex a token.  It is not
responsible for issues like directive handling, returning lookahead
tokens directly, multiple-include optimization, or conditional block
skipping.  It necessarily has a minor ro^le to play in memory management
of lexed lines.  I discuss these issues in a separate section (*note
Lexing a line::).

   The lexer places the token it lexes into storage pointed to by the
variable 'cur_token', and then increments it.  This variable is
important for correct diagnostic positioning.  Unless a specific line
and column are passed to the diagnostic routines, they will examine the
'line' and 'col' values of the token just before the location that
'cur_token' points to, and use that location to report the diagnostic.

   The lexer does not consider whitespace to be a token in its own
right.  If whitespace (other than a new line) precedes a token, it sets
the 'PREV_WHITE' bit in the token's flags.  Each token has its 'line'
and 'col' variables set to the line and column of the first character of
the token.  This line number is the line number in the translation unit,
and can be converted to a source (file, line) pair using the line map
code.

   The first token on a logical, i.e. unescaped, line has the flag 'BOL'
set for beginning-of-line.  This flag is intended for internal use, both
to distinguish a '#' that begins a directive from one that doesn't, and
to generate a call-back to clients that want to be notified about the
start of every non-directive line with tokens on it.  Clients cannot
reliably determine this for themselves: the first token might be a
macro, and the tokens of a macro expansion do not have the 'BOL' flag
set.  The macro expansion may even be empty, and the next token on the
line certainly won't have the 'BOL' flag set.

   New lines are treated specially; exactly how the lexer handles them
is context-dependent.  The C standard mandates that directives are
terminated by the first unescaped newline character, even if it appears
in the middle of a macro expansion.  Therefore, if the state variable
'in_directive' is set, the lexer returns a 'CPP_EOF' token, which is
normally used to indicate end-of-file, to indicate end-of-directive.  In
a directive a 'CPP_EOF' token never means end-of-file.  Conveniently, if
the caller was 'collect_args', it already handles 'CPP_EOF' as if it
were end-of-file, and reports an error about an unterminated macro
argument list.

   The C standard also specifies that a new line in the middle of the
arguments to a macro is treated as whitespace.  This white space is
important in case the macro argument is stringified.  The state variable
'parsing_args' is nonzero when the preprocessor is collecting the
arguments to a macro call.  It is set to 1 when looking for the opening
parenthesis to a function-like macro, and 2 when collecting the actual
arguments up to the closing parenthesis, since these two cases need to
be distinguished sometimes.  One such time is here: the lexer sets the
'PREV_WHITE' flag of a token if it meets a new line when 'parsing_args'
is set to 2.  It doesn't set it if it meets a new line when
'parsing_args' is 1, since then code like

     #define foo() bar
     foo
     baz

would be output with an erroneous space before 'baz':

     foo
      baz

   This is a good example of the subtlety of getting token spacing
correct in the preprocessor; there are plenty of tests in the testsuite
for corner cases like this.

   The lexer is written to treat each of '\r', '\n', '\r\n' and '\n\r'
as a single new line indicator.  This allows it to transparently
preprocess MS-DOS, Macintosh and Unix files without their needing to
pass through a special filter beforehand.

   We also decided to treat a backslash, either '\' or the trigraph
'??/', separated from one of the above newline indicators by non-comment
whitespace only, as intending to escape the newline.  It tends to be a
typing mistake, and cannot reasonably be mistaken for anything else in
any of the C-family grammars.  Since handling it this way is not
strictly conforming to the ISO standard, the library issues a warning
wherever it encounters it.

   Handling newlines like this is made simpler by doing it in one place
only.  The function 'handle_newline' takes care of all newline
characters, and 'skip_escaped_newlines' takes care of arbitrarily long
sequences of escaped newlines, deferring to 'handle_newline' to handle
the newlines themselves.

   The most painful aspect of lexing ISO-standard C and C++ is handling
trigraphs and backlash-escaped newlines.  Trigraphs are processed before
any interpretation of the meaning of a character is made, and
unfortunately there is a trigraph representation for a backslash, so it
is possible for the trigraph '??/' to introduce an escaped newline.

   Escaped newlines are tedious because theoretically they can occur
anywhere--between the '+' and '=' of the '+=' token, within the
characters of an identifier, and even between the '*' and '/' that
terminates a comment.  Moreover, you cannot be sure there is just
one--there might be an arbitrarily long sequence of them.

   So, for example, the routine that lexes a number, 'parse_number',
cannot assume that it can scan forwards until the first non-number
character and be done with it, because this could be the '\' introducing
an escaped newline, or the '?' introducing the trigraph sequence that
represents the '\' of an escaped newline.  If it encounters a '?' or
'\', it calls 'skip_escaped_newlines' to skip over any potential escaped
newlines before checking whether the number has been finished.

   Similarly code in the main body of '_cpp_lex_direct' cannot simply
check for a '=' after a '+' character to determine whether it has a '+='
token; it needs to be prepared for an escaped newline of some sort.
Such cases use the function 'get_effective_char', which returns the
first character after any intervening escaped newlines.

   The lexer needs to keep track of the correct column position,
including counting tabs as specified by the '-ftabstop=' option.  This
should be done even within C-style comments; they can appear in the
middle of a line, and we want to report diagnostics in the correct
position for text appearing after the end of the comment.

   Some identifiers, such as '__VA_ARGS__' and poisoned identifiers, may
be invalid and require a diagnostic.  However, if they appear in a macro
expansion we don't want to complain with each use of the macro.  It is
therefore best to catch them during the lexing stage, in
'parse_identifier'.  In both cases, whether a diagnostic is needed or
not is dependent upon the lexer's state.  For example, we don't want to
issue a diagnostic for re-poisoning a poisoned identifier, or for using
'__VA_ARGS__' in the expansion of a variable-argument macro.  Therefore
'parse_identifier' makes use of state flags to determine whether a
diagnostic is appropriate.  Since we change state on a per-token basis,
and don't lex whole lines at a time, this is not a problem.

   Another place where state flags are used to change behavior is whilst
lexing header names.  Normally, a '<' would be lexed as a single token.
After a '#include' directive, though, it should be lexed as a single
token as far as the nearest '>' character.  Note that we don't allow the
terminators of header names to be escaped; the first '"' or '>'
terminates the header name.

   Interpretation of some character sequences depends upon whether we
are lexing C, C++ or Objective-C, and on the revision of the standard in
force.  For example, '::' is a single token in C++, but in C it is two
separate ':' tokens and almost certainly a syntax error.  Such cases are
handled by '_cpp_lex_direct' based upon command-line flags stored in the
'cpp_options' structure.

   Once a token has been lexed, it leads an independent existence.  The
spelling of numbers, identifiers and strings is copied to permanent
storage from the original input buffer, so a token remains valid and
correct even if its source buffer is freed with '_cpp_pop_buffer'.  The
storage holding the spellings of such tokens remains until the client
program calls cpp_destroy, probably at the end of the translation unit.

Lexing a line
=============

When the preprocessor was changed to return pointers to tokens, one
feature I wanted was some sort of guarantee regarding how long a
returned pointer remains valid.  This is important to the stand-alone
preprocessor, the future direction of the C family front ends, and even
to cpplib itself internally.

   Occasionally the preprocessor wants to be able to peek ahead in the
token stream.  For example, after the name of a function-like macro, it
wants to check the next token to see if it is an opening parenthesis.
Another example is that, after reading the first few tokens of a
'#pragma' directive and not recognizing it as a registered pragma, it
wants to backtrack and allow the user-defined handler for unknown
pragmas to access the full '#pragma' token stream.  The stand-alone
preprocessor wants to be able to test the current token with the
previous one to see if a space needs to be inserted to preserve their
separate tokenization upon re-lexing (paste avoidance), so it needs to
be sure the pointer to the previous token is still valid.  The
recursive-descent C++ parser wants to be able to perform tentative
parsing arbitrarily far ahead in the token stream, and then to be able
to jump back to a prior position in that stream if necessary.

   The rule I chose, which is fairly natural, is to arrange that the
preprocessor lex all tokens on a line consecutively into a token buffer,
which I call a "token run", and when meeting an unescaped new line
(newlines within comments do not count either), to start lexing back at
the beginning of the run.  Note that we do _not_ lex a line of tokens at
once; if we did that 'parse_identifier' would not have state flags
available to warn about invalid identifiers (*note Invalid
identifiers::).

   In other words, accessing tokens that appeared earlier in the current
line is valid, but since each logical line overwrites the tokens of the
previous line, tokens from prior lines are unavailable.  In particular,
since a directive only occupies a single logical line, this means that
the directive handlers like the '#pragma' handler can jump around in the
directive's tokens if necessary.

   Two issues remain: what about tokens that arise from macro
expansions, and what happens when we have a long line that overflows the
token run?

   Since we promise clients that we preserve the validity of pointers
that we have already returned for tokens that appeared earlier in the
line, we cannot reallocate the run.  Instead, on overflow it is expanded
by chaining a new token run on to the end of the existing one.

   The tokens forming a macro's replacement list are collected by the
'#define' handler, and placed in storage that is only freed by
'cpp_destroy'.  So if a macro is expanded in the line of tokens, the
pointers to the tokens of its expansion that are returned will always
remain valid.  However, macros are a little trickier than that, since
they give rise to three sources of fresh tokens.  They are the built-in
macros like '__LINE__', and the '#' and '##' operators for
stringification and token pasting.  I handled this by allocating space
for these tokens from the lexer's token run chain.  This means they
automatically receive the same lifetime guarantees as lexed tokens, and
we don't need to concern ourselves with freeing them.

   Lexing into a line of tokens solves some of the token memory
management issues, but not all.  The opening parenthesis after a
function-like macro name might lie on a different line, and the front
ends definitely want the ability to look ahead past the end of the
current line.  So cpplib only moves back to the start of the token run
at the end of a line if the variable 'keep_tokens' is zero.
Line-buffering is quite natural for the preprocessor, and as a result
the only time cpplib needs to increment this variable is whilst looking
for the opening parenthesis to, and reading the arguments of, a
function-like macro.  In the near future cpplib will export an interface
to increment and decrement this variable, so that clients can share full
control over the lifetime of token pointers too.

   The routine '_cpp_lex_token' handles moving to new token runs,
calling '_cpp_lex_direct' to lex new tokens, or returning
previously-lexed tokens if we stepped back in the token stream.  It also
checks each token for the 'BOL' flag, which might indicate a directive
that needs to be handled, or require a start-of-line call-back to be
made.  '_cpp_lex_token' also handles skipping over tokens in failed
conditional blocks, and invalidates the control macro of the
multiple-include optimization if a token was successfully lexed outside
a directive.  In other words, its callers do not need to concern
themselves with such issues.

Hash Nodes
**********

When cpplib encounters an "identifier", it generates a hash code for it
and stores it in the hash table.  By "identifier" we mean tokens with
type 'CPP_NAME'; this includes identifiers in the usual C sense, as well
as keywords, directive names, macro names and so on.  For example, all
of 'pragma', 'int', 'foo' and '__GNUC__' are identifiers and hashed when
lexed.

   Each node in the hash table contain various information about the
identifier it represents.  For example, its length and type.  At any one
time, each identifier falls into exactly one of three categories:

   * Macros

     These have been declared to be macros, either on the command line
     or with '#define'.  A few, such as '__TIME__' are built-ins entered
     in the hash table during initialization.  The hash node for a
     normal macro points to a structure with more information about the
     macro, such as whether it is function-like, how many arguments it
     takes, and its expansion.  Built-in macros are flagged as special,
     and instead contain an enum indicating which of the various
     built-in macros it is.

   * Assertions

     Assertions are in a separate namespace to macros.  To enforce this,
     cpp actually prepends a '#' character before hashing and entering
     it in the hash table.  An assertion's node points to a chain of
     answers to that assertion.

   * Void

     Everything else falls into this category--an identifier that is not
     currently a macro, or a macro that has since been undefined with
     '#undef'.

     When preprocessing C++, this category also includes the named
     operators, such as 'xor'.  In expressions these behave like the
     operators they represent, but in contexts where the spelling of a
     token matters they are spelt differently.  This spelling
     distinction is relevant when they are operands of the stringizing
     and pasting macro operators '#' and '##'.  Named operator hash
     nodes are flagged, both to catch the spelling distinction and to
     prevent them from being defined as macros.

   The same identifiers share the same hash node.  Since each identifier
token, after lexing, contains a pointer to its hash node, this is used
to provide rapid lookup of various information.  For example, when
parsing a '#define' statement, CPP flags each argument's identifier hash
node with the index of that argument.  This makes duplicated argument
checking an O(1) operation for each argument.  Similarly, for each
identifier in the macro's expansion, lookup to see if it is an argument,
and which argument it is, is also an O(1) operation.  Further, each
directive name, such as 'endif', has an associated directive enum stored
in its hash node, so that directive lookup is also O(1).

Macro Expansion Algorithm
*************************

Macro expansion is a tricky operation, fraught with nasty corner cases
and situations that render what you thought was a nifty way to optimize
the preprocessor's expansion algorithm wrong in quite subtle ways.

   I strongly recommend you have a good grasp of how the C and C++
standards require macros to be expanded before diving into this section,
let alone the code!.  If you don't have a clear mental picture of how
things like nested macro expansion, stringification and token pasting
are supposed to work, damage to your sanity can quickly result.

Internal representation of macros
=================================

The preprocessor stores macro expansions in tokenized form.  This saves
repeated lexing passes during expansion, at the cost of a small increase
in memory consumption on average.  The tokens are stored contiguously in
memory, so a pointer to the first one and a token count is all you need
to get the replacement list of a macro.

   If the macro is a function-like macro the preprocessor also stores
its parameters, in the form of an ordered list of pointers to the hash
table entry of each parameter's identifier.  Further, in the macro's
stored expansion each occurrence of a parameter is replaced with a
special token of type 'CPP_MACRO_ARG'.  Each such token holds the index
of the parameter it represents in the parameter list, which allows rapid
replacement of parameters with their arguments during expansion.
Despite this optimization it is still necessary to store the original
parameters to the macro, both for dumping with e.g., '-dD', and to warn
about non-trivial macro redefinitions when the parameter names have
changed.

Macro expansion overview
========================

The preprocessor maintains a "context stack", implemented as a linked
list of 'cpp_context' structures, which together represent the macro
expansion state at any one time.  The 'struct cpp_reader' member
variable 'context' points to the current top of this stack.  The top
normally holds the unexpanded replacement list of the innermost macro
under expansion, except when cpplib is about to pre-expand an argument,
in which case it holds that argument's unexpanded tokens.

   When there are no macros under expansion, cpplib is in "base
context".  All contexts other than the base context contain a contiguous
list of tokens delimited by a starting and ending token.  When not in
base context, cpplib obtains the next token from the list of the top
context.  If there are no tokens left in the list, it pops that context
off the stack, and subsequent ones if necessary, until an unexhausted
context is found or it returns to base context.  In base context, cpplib
reads tokens directly from the lexer.

   If it encounters an identifier that is both a macro and enabled for
expansion, cpplib prepares to push a new context for that macro on the
stack by calling the routine 'enter_macro_context'.  When this routine
returns, the new context will contain the unexpanded tokens of the
replacement list of that macro.  In the case of function-like macros,
'enter_macro_context' also replaces any parameters in the replacement
list, stored as 'CPP_MACRO_ARG' tokens, with the appropriate macro
argument.  If the standard requires that the parameter be replaced with
its expanded argument, the argument will have been fully macro expanded
first.

   'enter_macro_context' also handles special macros like '__LINE__'.
Although these macros expand to a single token which cannot contain any
further macros, for reasons of token spacing (*note Token Spacing::) and
simplicity of implementation, cpplib handles these special macros by
pushing a context containing just that one token.

   The final thing that 'enter_macro_context' does before returning is
to mark the macro disabled for expansion (except for special macros like
'__TIME__').  The macro is re-enabled when its context is later popped
from the context stack, as described above.  This strict ordering
ensures that a macro is disabled whilst its expansion is being scanned,
but that it is _not_ disabled whilst any arguments to it are being
expanded.

Scanning the replacement list for macros to expand
==================================================

The C standard states that, after any parameters have been replaced with
their possibly-expanded arguments, the replacement list is scanned for
nested macros.  Further, any identifiers in the replacement list that
are not expanded during this scan are never again eligible for expansion
in the future, if the reason they were not expanded is that the macro in
question was disabled.

   Clearly this latter condition can only apply to tokens resulting from
argument pre-expansion.  Other tokens never have an opportunity to be
re-tested for expansion.  It is possible for identifiers that are
function-like macros to not expand initially but to expand during a
later scan.  This occurs when the identifier is the last token of an
argument (and therefore originally followed by a comma or a closing
parenthesis in its macro's argument list), and when it replaces its
parameter in the macro's replacement list, the subsequent token happens
to be an opening parenthesis (itself possibly the first token of an
argument).

   It is important to note that when cpplib reads the last token of a
given context, that context still remains on the stack.  Only when
looking for the _next_ token do we pop it off the stack and drop to a
lower context.  This makes backing up by one token easy, but more
importantly ensures that the macro corresponding to the current context
is still disabled when we are considering the last token of its
replacement list for expansion (or indeed expanding it).  As an example,
which illustrates many of the points above, consider

     #define foo(x) bar x
     foo(foo) (2)

which fully expands to 'bar foo (2)'.  During pre-expansion of the
argument, 'foo' does not expand even though the macro is enabled, since
it has no following parenthesis [pre-expansion of an argument only uses
tokens from that argument; it cannot take tokens from whatever follows
the macro invocation].  This still leaves the argument token 'foo'
eligible for future expansion.  Then, when re-scanning after argument
replacement, the token 'foo' is rejected for expansion, and marked
ineligible for future expansion, since the macro is now disabled.  It is
disabled because the replacement list 'bar foo' of the macro is still on
the context stack.

   If instead the algorithm looked for an opening parenthesis first and
then tested whether the macro were disabled it would be subtly wrong.
In the example above, the replacement list of 'foo' would be popped in
the process of finding the parenthesis, re-enabling 'foo' and expanding
it a second time.

Looking for a function-like macro's opening parenthesis
=======================================================

Function-like macros only expand when immediately followed by a
parenthesis.  To do this cpplib needs to temporarily disable macros and
read the next token.  Unfortunately, because of spacing issues (*note
Token Spacing::), there can be fake padding tokens in-between, and if
the next real token is not a parenthesis cpplib needs to be able to back
up that one token as well as retain the information in any intervening
padding tokens.

   Backing up more than one token when macros are involved is not
permitted by cpplib, because in general it might involve issues like
restoring popped contexts onto the context stack, which are too hard.
Instead, searching for the parenthesis is handled by a special function,
'funlike_invocation_p', which remembers padding information as it reads
tokens.  If the next real token is not an opening parenthesis, it backs
up that one token, and then pushes an extra context just containing the
padding information if necessary.

Marking tokens ineligible for future expansion
==============================================

As discussed above, cpplib needs a way of marking tokens as
unexpandable.  Since the tokens cpplib handles are read-only once they
have been lexed, it instead makes a copy of the token and adds the flag
'NO_EXPAND' to the copy.

   For efficiency and to simplify memory management by avoiding having
to remember to free these tokens, they are allocated as temporary tokens
from the lexer's current token run (*note Lexing a line::) using the
function '_cpp_temp_token'.  The tokens are then re-used once the
current line of tokens has been read in.

   This might sound unsafe.  However, tokens runs are not re-used at the
end of a line if it happens to be in the middle of a macro argument
list, and cpplib only wants to back-up more than one lexer token in
situations where no macro expansion is involved, so the optimization is
safe.

Token Spacing
*************

First, consider an issue that only concerns the stand-alone
preprocessor: there needs to be a guarantee that re-reading its
preprocessed output results in an identical token stream.  Without
taking special measures, this might not be the case because of macro
substitution.  For example:

     #define PLUS +
     #define EMPTY
     #define f(x) =x=
     +PLUS -EMPTY- PLUS+ f(=)
             ==> + + - - + + = = =
     _not_
             ==> ++ -- ++ ===

   One solution would be to simply insert a space between all adjacent
tokens.  However, we would like to keep space insertion to a minimum,
both for aesthetic reasons and because it causes problems for people who
still try to abuse the preprocessor for things like Fortran source and
Makefiles.

   For now, just notice that when tokens are added (or removed, as shown
by the 'EMPTY' example) from the original lexed token stream, we need to
check for accidental token pasting.  We call this "paste avoidance".
Token addition and removal can only occur because of macro expansion,
but accidental pasting can occur in many places: both before and after
each macro replacement, each argument replacement, and additionally each
token created by the '#' and '##' operators.

   Look at how the preprocessor gets whitespace output correct normally.
The 'cpp_token' structure contains a flags byte, and one of those flags
is 'PREV_WHITE'.  This is flagged by the lexer, and indicates that the
token was preceded by whitespace of some form other than a new line.
The stand-alone preprocessor can use this flag to decide whether to
insert a space between tokens in the output.

   Now consider the result of the following macro expansion:

     #define add(x, y, z) x + y +z;
     sum = add (1,2, 3);
             ==> sum = 1 + 2 +3;

   The interesting thing here is that the tokens '1' and '2' are output
with a preceding space, and '3' is output without a preceding space, but
when lexed none of these tokens had that property.  Careful
consideration reveals that '1' gets its preceding whitespace from the
space preceding 'add' in the macro invocation, _not_ replacement list.
'2' gets its whitespace from the space preceding the parameter 'y' in
the macro replacement list, and '3' has no preceding space because
parameter 'z' has none in the replacement list.

   Once lexed, tokens are effectively fixed and cannot be altered, since
pointers to them might be held in many places, in particular by
in-progress macro expansions.  So instead of modifying the two tokens
above, the preprocessor inserts a special token, which I call a "padding
token", into the token stream to indicate that spacing of the subsequent
token is special.  The preprocessor inserts padding tokens in front of
every macro expansion and expanded macro argument.  These point to a
"source token" from which the subsequent real token should inherit its
spacing.  In the above example, the source tokens are 'add' in the macro
invocation, and 'y' and 'z' in the macro replacement list, respectively.

   It is quite easy to get multiple padding tokens in a row, for example
if a macro's first replacement token expands straight into another
macro.

     #define foo bar
     #define bar baz
     [foo]
             ==> [baz]

   Here, two padding tokens are generated with sources the 'foo' token
between the brackets, and the 'bar' token from foo's replacement list,
respectively.  Clearly the first padding token is the one to use, so the
output code should contain a rule that the first padding token in a
sequence is the one that matters.

   But what if a macro expansion is left?  Adjusting the above example
slightly:

     #define foo bar
     #define bar EMPTY baz
     #define EMPTY
     [foo] EMPTY;
             ==> [ baz] ;

   As shown, now there should be a space before 'baz' and the semicolon
in the output.

   The rules we decided above fail for 'baz': we generate three padding
tokens, one per macro invocation, before the token 'baz'.  We would then
have it take its spacing from the first of these, which carries source
token 'foo' with no leading space.

   It is vital that cpplib get spacing correct in these examples since
any of these macro expansions could be stringified, where spacing
matters.

   So, this demonstrates that not just entering macro and argument
expansions, but leaving them requires special handling too.  I made
cpplib insert a padding token with a 'NULL' source token when leaving
macro expansions, as well as after each replaced argument in a macro's
replacement list.  It also inserts appropriate padding tokens on either
side of tokens created by the '#' and '##' operators.  I expanded the
rule so that, if we see a padding token with a 'NULL' source token,
_and_ that source token has no leading space, then we behave as if we
have seen no padding tokens at all.  A quick check shows this rule will
then get the above example correct as well.

   Now a relationship with paste avoidance is apparent: we have to be
careful about paste avoidance in exactly the same locations we have
padding tokens in order to get white space correct.  This makes
implementation of paste avoidance easy: wherever the stand-alone
preprocessor is fixing up spacing because of padding tokens, and it
turns out that no space is needed, it has to take the extra step to
check that a space is not needed after all to avoid an accidental paste.
The function 'cpp_avoid_paste' advises whether a space is required
between two consecutive tokens.  To avoid excessive spacing, it tries
hard to only require a space if one is likely to be necessary, but for
reasons of efficiency it is slightly conservative and might recommend a
space where one is not strictly needed.

Line numbering
**************

Just which line number anyway?
==============================

There are three reasonable requirements a cpplib client might have for
the line number of a token passed to it:

   * The source line it was lexed on.
   * The line it is output on.  This can be different to the line it was
     lexed on if, for example, there are intervening escaped newlines or
     C-style comments.  For example:

          foo /* A long
          comment */ bar \
          baz
          =>
          foo bar baz

   * If the token results from a macro expansion, the line of the macro
     name, or possibly the line of the closing parenthesis in the case
     of function-like macro expansion.

   The 'cpp_token' structure contains 'line' and 'col' members.  The
lexer fills these in with the line and column of the first character of
the token.  Consequently, but maybe unexpectedly, a token from the
replacement list of a macro expansion carries the location of the token
within the '#define' directive, because cpplib expands a macro by
returning pointers to the tokens in its replacement list.  The current
implementation of cpplib assigns tokens created from built-in macros and
the '#' and '##' operators the location of the most recently lexed
token.  This is a because they are allocated from the lexer's token
runs, and because of the way the diagnostic routines infer the
appropriate location to report.

   The diagnostic routines in cpplib display the location of the most
recently _lexed_ token, unless they are passed a specific line and
column to report.  For diagnostics regarding tokens that arise from
macro expansions, it might also be helpful for the user to see the
original location in the macro definition that the token came from.
Since that is exactly the information each token carries, such an
enhancement could be made relatively easily in future.

   The stand-alone preprocessor faces a similar problem when determining
the correct line to output the token on: the position attached to a
token is fairly useless if the token came from a macro expansion.  All
tokens on a logical line should be output on its first physical line, so
the token's reported location is also wrong if it is part of a physical
line other than the first.

   To solve these issues, cpplib provides a callback that is generated
whenever it lexes a preprocessing token that starts a new logical line
other than a directive.  It passes this token (which may be a 'CPP_EOF'
token indicating the end of the translation unit) to the callback
routine, which can then use the line and column of this token to produce
correct output.

Representation of line numbers
==============================

As mentioned above, cpplib stores with each token the line number that
it was lexed on.  In fact, this number is not the number of the line in
the source file, but instead bears more resemblance to the number of the
line in the translation unit.

   The preprocessor maintains a monotonic increasing line count, which
is incremented at every new line character (and also at the end of any
buffer that does not end in a new line).  Since a line number of zero is
useful to indicate certain special states and conditions, this variable
starts counting from one.

   This variable therefore uniquely enumerates each line in the
translation unit.  With some simple infrastructure, it is straight
forward to map from this to the original source file and line number
pair, saving space whenever line number information needs to be saved.
The code the implements this mapping lies in the files 'line-map.c' and
'line-map.h'.

   Command-line macros and assertions are implemented by pushing a
buffer containing the right hand side of an equivalent '#define' or
'#assert' directive.  Some built-in macros are handled similarly.  Since
these are all processed before the first line of the main input file, it
will typically have an assigned line closer to twenty than to one.

The Multiple-Include Optimization
*********************************

Header files are often of the form

     #ifndef FOO
     #define FOO
     ...
     #endif

to prevent the compiler from processing them more than once.  The
preprocessor notices such header files, so that if the header file
appears in a subsequent '#include' directive and 'FOO' is defined, then
it is ignored and it doesn't preprocess or even re-open the file a
second time.  This is referred to as the "multiple include
optimization".

   Under what circumstances is such an optimization valid?  If the file
were included a second time, it can only be optimized away if that
inclusion would result in no tokens to return, and no relevant
directives to process.  Therefore the current implementation imposes
requirements and makes some allowances as follows:

  1. There must be no tokens outside the controlling '#if'-'#endif'
     pair, but whitespace and comments are permitted.

  2. There must be no directives outside the controlling directive pair,
     but the "null directive" (a line containing nothing other than a
     single '#' and possibly whitespace) is permitted.

  3. The opening directive must be of the form

          #ifndef FOO

     or

          #if !defined FOO     [equivalently, #if !defined(FOO)]

  4. In the second form above, the tokens forming the '#if' expression
     must have come directly from the source file--no macro expansion
     must have been involved.  This is because macro definitions can
     change, and tracking whether or not a relevant change has been made
     is not worth the implementation cost.

  5. There can be no '#else' or '#elif' directives at the outer
     conditional block level, because they would probably contain
     something of interest to a subsequent pass.

   First, when pushing a new file on the buffer stack,
'_stack_include_file' sets the controlling macro 'mi_cmacro' to 'NULL',
and sets 'mi_valid' to 'true'.  This indicates that the preprocessor has
not yet encountered anything that would invalidate the multiple-include
optimization.  As described in the next few paragraphs, these two
variables having these values effectively indicates top-of-file.

   When about to return a token that is not part of a directive,
'_cpp_lex_token' sets 'mi_valid' to 'false'.  This enforces the
constraint that tokens outside the controlling conditional block
invalidate the optimization.

   The 'do_if', when appropriate, and 'do_ifndef' directive handlers
pass the controlling macro to the function 'push_conditional'.  cpplib
maintains a stack of nested conditional blocks, and after processing
every opening conditional this function pushes an 'if_stack' structure
onto the stack.  In this structure it records the controlling macro for
the block, provided there is one and we're at top-of-file (as described
above).  If an '#elif' or '#else' directive is encountered, the
controlling macro for that block is cleared to 'NULL'.  Otherwise, it
survives until the '#endif' closing the block, upon which 'do_endif'
sets 'mi_valid' to true and stores the controlling macro in 'mi_cmacro'.

   '_cpp_handle_directive' clears 'mi_valid' when processing any
directive other than an opening conditional and the null directive.
With this, and requiring top-of-file to record a controlling macro, and
no '#else' or '#elif' for it to survive and be copied to 'mi_cmacro' by
'do_endif', we have enforced the absence of directives outside the main
conditional block for the optimization to be on.

   Note that whilst we are inside the conditional block, 'mi_valid' is
likely to be reset to 'false', but this does not matter since the
closing '#endif' restores it to 'true' if appropriate.

   Finally, since '_cpp_lex_direct' pops the file off the buffer stack
at 'EOF' without returning a token, if the '#endif' directive was not
followed by any tokens, 'mi_valid' is 'true' and '_cpp_pop_file_buffer'
remembers the controlling macro associated with the file.  Subsequent
calls to 'stack_include_file' result in no buffer being pushed if the
controlling macro is defined, effecting the optimization.

   A quick word on how we handle the

     #if !defined FOO

case.  '_cpp_parse_expr' and 'parse_defined' take steps to see whether
the three stages '!', 'defined-expression' and 'end-of-directive' occur
in order in a '#if' expression.  If so, they return the guard macro to
'do_if' in the variable 'mi_ind_cmacro', and otherwise set it to 'NULL'.
'enter_macro_context' sets 'mi_valid' to false, so if a macro was
expanded whilst parsing any part of the expression, then the top-of-file
test in 'push_conditional' fails and the optimization is turned off.

File Handling
*************

Fairly obviously, the file handling code of cpplib resides in the file
'files.c'.  It takes care of the details of file searching, opening,
reading and caching, for both the main source file and all the headers
it recursively includes.

   The basic strategy is to minimize the number of system calls.  On
many systems, the basic 'open ()' and 'fstat ()' system calls can be
quite expensive.  For every '#include'-d file, we need to try all the
directories in the search path until we find a match.  Some projects,
such as glibc, pass twenty or thirty include paths on the command line,
so this can rapidly become time consuming.

   For a header file we have not encountered before we have little
choice but to do this.  However, it is often the case that the same
headers are repeatedly included, and in these cases we try to avoid
repeating the filesystem queries whilst searching for the correct file.

   For each file we try to open, we store the constructed path in a
splay tree.  This path first undergoes simplification by the function
'_cpp_simplify_pathname'.  For example, '/usr/include/bits/../foo.h' is
simplified to '/usr/include/foo.h' before we enter it in the splay tree
and try to 'open ()' the file.  CPP will then find subsequent uses of
'foo.h', even as '/usr/include/foo.h', in the splay tree and save system
calls.

   Further, it is likely the file contents have also been cached, saving
a 'read ()' system call.  We don't bother caching the contents of header
files that are re-inclusion protected, and whose re-inclusion macro is
defined when we leave the header file for the first time.  If the host
supports it, we try to map suitably large files into memory, rather than
reading them in directly.

   The include paths are internally stored on a null-terminated
singly-linked list, starting with the '"header.h"' directory search
chain, which then links into the '<header.h>' directory chain.

   Files included with the '<foo.h>' syntax start the lookup directly in
the second half of this chain.  However, files included with the
'"foo.h"' syntax start at the beginning of the chain, but with one extra
directory prepended.  This is the directory of the current file; the one
containing the '#include' directive.  Prepending this directory on a
per-file basis is handled by the function 'search_from'.

   Note that a header included with a directory component, such as
'#include "mydir/foo.h"' and opened as '/usr/local/include/mydir/foo.h',
will have the complete path minus the basename 'foo.h' as the current
directory.

   Enough information is stored in the splay tree that CPP can
immediately tell whether it can skip the header file because of the
multiple include optimization, whether the file didn't exist or couldn't
be opened for some reason, or whether the header was flagged not to be
re-used, as it is with the obsolete '#import' directive.

   For the benefit of MS-DOS filesystems with an 8.3 filename
limitation, CPP offers the ability to treat various include file names
as aliases for the real header files with shorter names.  The map from
one to the other is found in a special file called 'header.gcc', stored
in the command line (or system) include directories to which the mapping
applies.  This may be higher up the directory tree than the full path to
the file minus the base name.

1 Programming Languages Supported by GCC
****************************************

GCC stands for "GNU Compiler Collection".  GCC is an integrated
distribution of compilers for several major programming languages.
These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++,
Java, Fortran, Ada, and Go.

 The abbreviation "GCC" has multiple meanings in common use.  The
current official meaning is "GNU Compiler Collection", which refers
generically to the complete suite of tools.  The name historically stood
for "GNU C Compiler", and this usage is still common when the emphasis
is on compiling C programs.  Finally, the name is also used when
speaking of the "language-independent" component of GCC: code shared
among the compilers for all supported languages.

 The language-independent component of GCC includes the majority of the
optimizers, as well as the "back ends" that generate machine code for
various processors.

 The part of a compiler that is specific to a particular language is
called the "front end".  In addition to the front ends that are
integrated components of GCC, there are several other front ends that
are maintained separately.  These support languages such as Pascal,
Mercury, and COBOL.  To use these, they must be built together with GCC
proper.

 Most of the compilers for languages other than C have their own names.
The C++ compiler is G++, the Ada compiler is GNAT, and so on.  When we
talk about compiling one of those languages, we might refer to that
compiler by its own name, or as GCC.  Either is correct.

 Historically, compilers for many languages, including C++ and Fortran,
have been implemented as "preprocessors" which emit another high level
language such as C.  None of the compilers included in GCC are
implemented this way; they all generate machine code directly.  This
sort of preprocessor should not be confused with the "C preprocessor",
which is an integral feature of the C, C++, Objective-C and
Objective-C++ languages.

2 Language Standards Supported by GCC
*************************************

For each language compiled by GCC for which there is a standard, GCC
attempts to follow one or more versions of that standard, possibly with
some exceptions, and possibly with some extensions.

2.1 C language
==============

GCC supports three versions of the C standard, although support for the
most recent version is not yet complete.

 The original ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989) was ratified in 1989 and
published in 1990.  This standard was ratified as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) later in 1990.  There were no technical differences
between these publications, although the sections of the ANSI standard
were renumbered and became clauses in the ISO standard.  This standard,
in both its forms, is commonly known as "C89", or occasionally as "C90",
from the dates of ratification.  The ANSI standard, but not the ISO
standard, also came with a Rationale document.  To select this standard
in GCC, use one of the options '-ansi', '-std=c90' or
'-std=iso9899:1990'; to obtain all the diagnostics required by the
standard, you should also specify '-pedantic' (or '-pedantic-errors' if
you want them to be errors rather than warnings).  *Note Options
Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

 Errors in the 1990 ISO C standard were corrected in two Technical
Corrigenda published in 1994 and 1996.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 An amendment to the 1990 standard was published in 1995.  This
amendment added digraphs and '__STDC_VERSION__' to the language, but
otherwise concerned the library.  This amendment is commonly known as
"AMD1"; the amended standard is sometimes known as "C94" or "C95".  To
select this standard in GCC, use the option '-std=iso9899:199409' (with,
as for other standard versions, '-pedantic' to receive all required
diagnostics).

 A new edition of the ISO C standard was published in 1999 as ISO/IEC
9899:1999, and is commonly known as "C99".  GCC has substantially
complete support for this standard version; see
<http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html> for details.  To select this
standard, use '-std=c99' or '-std=iso9899:1999'.  (While in development,
drafts of this standard version were referred to as "C9X".)

 Errors in the 1999 ISO C standard were corrected in three Technical
Corrigenda published in 2001, 2004 and 2007.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

 A fourth version of the C standard, known as "C11", was published in
2011 as ISO/IEC 9899:2011.  GCC has substantially complete support for
this standard, enabled with '-std=c11' or '-std=iso9899:2011'.  (While
in development, drafts of this standard version were referred to as
"C1X".)

 By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C language that on rare
occasions conflict with the C standard.  *Note Extensions to the C
Language Family: C Extensions.  Use of the '-std' options listed above
will disable these extensions where they conflict with the C standard
version selected.  You may also select an extended version of the C
language explicitly with '-std=gnu90' (for C90 with GNU extensions),
'-std=gnu99' (for C99 with GNU extensions) or '-std=gnu11' (for C11 with
GNU extensions).  The default, if no C language dialect options are
given, is '-std=gnu90'; this is intended to change to '-std=gnu11' in
some future release.  Some features that are part of the C99 standard
are accepted as extensions in C90 mode, and some features that are part
of the C11 standard are accepted as extensions in C90 and C99 modes.

 The ISO C standard defines (in clause 4) two classes of conforming
implementation.  A "conforming hosted implementation" supports the whole
standard including all the library facilities; a "conforming
freestanding implementation" is only required to provide certain library
facilities: those in '<float.h>', '<limits.h>', '<stdarg.h>', and
'<stddef.h>'; since AMD1, also those in '<iso646.h>'; since C99, also
those in '<stdbool.h>' and '<stdint.h>'; and since C11, also those in
'<stdalign.h>' and '<stdnoreturn.h>'.  In addition, complex types, added
in C99, are not required for freestanding implementations.  The standard
also defines two environments for programs, a "freestanding
environment", required of all implementations and which may not have
library facilities beyond those required of freestanding
implementations, where the handling of program startup and termination
are implementation-defined, and a "hosted environment", which is not
required, in which all the library facilities are provided and startup
is through a function 'int main (void)' or 'int main (int, char *[])'.
An OS kernel would be a freestanding environment; a program using the
facilities of an operating system would normally be in a hosted
implementation.

 GCC aims towards being usable as a conforming freestanding
implementation, or as the compiler for a conforming hosted
implementation.  By default, it will act as the compiler for a hosted
implementation, defining '__STDC_HOSTED__' as '1' and presuming that
when the names of ISO C functions are used, they have the semantics
defined in the standard.  To make it act as a conforming freestanding
implementation for a freestanding environment, use the option
'-ffreestanding'; it will then define '__STDC_HOSTED__' to '0' and not
make assumptions about the meanings of function names from the standard
library, with exceptions noted below.  To build an OS kernel, you may
well still need to make your own arrangements for linking and startup.
*Note Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

 GCC does not provide the library facilities required only of hosted
implementations, nor yet all the facilities required by C99 of
freestanding implementations on all platforms; to use the facilities of
a hosted environment, you will need to find them elsewhere (for example,
in the GNU C library).  *Note Standard Libraries: Standard Libraries.

 Most of the compiler support routines used by GCC are present in
'libgcc', but there are a few exceptions.  GCC requires the freestanding
environment provide 'memcpy', 'memmove', 'memset' and 'memcmp'.
Finally, if '__builtin_trap' is used, and the target does not implement
the 'trap' pattern, then GCC will emit a call to 'abort'.

 For references to Technical Corrigenda, Rationale documents and
information concerning the history of C that is available online, see
<http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html>

2.2 C++ language
================

GCC supports the original ISO C++ standard (1998) and contains
experimental support for the second ISO C++ standard (2011).

 The original ISO C++ standard was published as the ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 14882:1998) and amended by a Technical Corrigenda published in
2003 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003).  These standards are referred to as C++98 and
C++03, respectively.  GCC implements the majority of C++98 ('export' is
a notable exception) and most of the changes in C++03.  To select this
standard in GCC, use one of the options '-ansi', '-std=c++98', or
'-std=c++03'; to obtain all the diagnostics required by the standard,
you should also specify '-pedantic' (or '-pedantic-errors' if you want
them to be errors rather than warnings).

 A revised ISO C++ standard was published in 2011 as ISO/IEC 14882:2011,
and is referred to as C++11; before its publication it was commonly
referred to as C++0x.  C++11 contains several changes to the C++
language, most of which have been implemented in an experimental C++11
mode in GCC.  For information regarding the C++11 features available in
the experimental C++11 mode, see
<http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html>.  To select this standard in
GCC, use the option '-std=c++11'; to obtain all the diagnostics required
by the standard, you should also specify '-pedantic' (or
'-pedantic-errors' if you want them to be errors rather than warnings).

 More information about the C++ standards is available on the ISO C++
committee's web site at <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/>.

 By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C++ language; *Note
Options Controlling C++ Dialect: C++ Dialect Options.  Use of the '-std'
option listed above will disable these extensions.  You may also select
an extended version of the C++ language explicitly with '-std=gnu++98'
(for C++98 with GNU extensions) or '-std=gnu++11' (for C++11 with GNU
extensions).  The default, if no C++ language dialect options are given,
is '-std=gnu++98'.

2.3 Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages
===========================================

GCC supports "traditional" Objective-C (also known as "Objective-C 1.0")
and contains support for the Objective-C exception and synchronization
syntax.  It has also support for a number of "Objective-C 2.0" language
extensions, including properties, fast enumeration (only for
Objective-C), method attributes and the @optional and @required keywords
in protocols.  GCC supports Objective-C++ and features available in
Objective-C are also available in Objective-C++.

 GCC by default uses the GNU Objective-C runtime library, which is part
of GCC and is not the same as the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime library
used on Apple systems.  There are a number of differences documented in
this manual.  The options '-fgnu-runtime' and '-fnext-runtime' allow you
to switch between producing output that works with the GNU Objective-C
runtime library and output that works with the Apple/NeXT Objective-C
runtime library.

 There is no formal written standard for Objective-C or Objective-C++.
The authoritative manual on traditional Objective-C (1.0) is
"Object-Oriented Programming and the Objective-C Language", available at
a number of web sites:
   * <http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/ObjectivCBook.pdf>
     is the original NeXTstep document;
   * <http://objc.toodarkpark.net> is the same document in another
     format;
   * 
     <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/>
     has an updated version but make sure you search for "Object
     Oriented Programming and the Objective-C Programming Language 1.0",
     not documentation on the newer "Objective-C 2.0" language

 The Objective-C exception and synchronization syntax (that is, the
keywords @try, @throw, @catch, @finally and @synchronized) is supported
by GCC and is enabled with the option '-fobjc-exceptions'.  The syntax
is briefly documented in this manual and in the Objective-C 2.0 manuals
from Apple.

 The Objective-C 2.0 language extensions and features are automatically
enabled; they include properties (via the @property, @synthesize and
@dynamic keywords), fast enumeration (not available in Objective-C++),
attributes for methods (such as deprecated, noreturn, sentinel, format),
the unused attribute for method arguments, the @package keyword for
instance variables and the @optional and @required keywords in
protocols.  You can disable all these Objective-C 2.0 language
extensions with the option '-fobjc-std=objc1', which causes the compiler
to recognize the same Objective-C language syntax recognized by GCC 4.0,
and to produce an error if one of the new features is used.

 GCC has currently no support for non-fragile instance variables.

 The authoritative manual on Objective-C 2.0 is available from Apple:

     <http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/>

available online, see <http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html>

2.4 Go language
===============

As of the GCC 4.7.1 release, GCC supports the Go 1 language standard,
described at <http://golang.org/doc/go1.html>.

2.5 References for other languages

3 GCC Command Options
*********************

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the '-c' option says not
to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by
the assembler.

 Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

 Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

 *Note Compiling C++ Programs: Invoking G++, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.

 The 'gcc' program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may _not_ be grouped: '-dv' is very different from '-d -v'.

 You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify '-L' more than once, the
directories are searched in the order specified.  Also, the placement of
the '-l' option is significant.

 Many options have long names starting with '-f' or with '-W'--for
example, '-fmove-loop-invariants', '-Wformat' and so on.  Most of these
have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of '-ffoo' is
'-fno-foo'.  This manual documents only one of these two forms,
whichever one is not the default.

3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output
==========================================

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several assembler
input files, or into one assembler input file; then each assembler input
file produces an object file, and linking combines all the object files
(those newly compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable
file.

 For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

'FILE.c'
     C source code that must be preprocessed.

'FILE.i'
     C source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.ii'
     C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.m'
     Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the
     'libobjc' library to make an Objective-C program work.

'FILE.mi'
     Objective-C source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.mm'
'FILE.M'
     Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the
     'libobjc' library to make an Objective-C++ program work.  Note that
     '.M' refers to a literal capital M.

'FILE.mii'
     Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.h'
     C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into
     a precompiled header (default), or C, C++ header file to be turned
     into an Ada spec (via the '-fdump-ada-spec' switch).

'FILE.cc'
'FILE.cp'
'FILE.cxx'
'FILE.cpp'
'FILE.CPP'
'FILE.c++'
'FILE.C'
     C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in '.cxx',
     the last two letters must both be literally 'x'.  Likewise, '.C'
     refers to a literal capital C.

'FILE.mm'
'FILE.M'
     Objective-C++ source code that must be preprocessed.

'FILE.mii'
     Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.hh'
'FILE.H'
'FILE.hp'
'FILE.hxx'
'FILE.hpp'
'FILE.HPP'
'FILE.h++'
'FILE.tcc'
     C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header or Ada spec.

'FILE.f'
'FILE.for'
'FILE.ftn'
     Fixed form Fortran source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.F'
'FILE.FOR'
'FILE.fpp'
'FILE.FPP'
'FILE.FTN'
     Fixed form Fortran source code that must be preprocessed (with the
     traditional preprocessor).

'FILE.f90'
'FILE.f95'
'FILE.f03'
'FILE.f08'
     Free form Fortran source code that should not be preprocessed.

'FILE.F90'
'FILE.F95'
'FILE.F03'
'FILE.F08'
     Free form Fortran source code that must be preprocessed (with the
     traditional preprocessor).

'FILE.go'
     Go source code.

'FILE.ads'
     Ada source code file that contains a library unit declaration (a
     declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a generic
     instantiation), or a library unit renaming declaration (a package,
     generic, or subprogram renaming declaration).  Such files are also
     called "specs".

'FILE.adb'
     Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a subprogram
     or package body).  Such files are also called "bodies".

'FILE.s'
     Assembler code.

'FILE.S'
'FILE.sx'
     Assembler code that must be preprocessed.

'OTHER'
     An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file name with
     no recognized suffix is treated this way.

 You can specify the input language explicitly with the '-x' option:

'-x LANGUAGE'
     Specify explicitly the LANGUAGE for the following input files
     (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the
     file name suffix).  This option applies to all following input
     files until the next '-x' option.  Possible values for LANGUAGE
     are:
          c  c-header  cpp-output
          c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
          objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
          objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
          ada
          f77  f77-cpp-input f95  f95-cpp-input
          go
          java

'-x none'
     Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files
     are handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if
     '-x' has not been used at all).

'-pass-exit-codes'
     Normally the 'gcc' program exits with the code of 1 if any phase of
     the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
     '-pass-exit-codes', the 'gcc' program instead returns with the
     numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
     indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an
     internal compiler error is encountered.

 If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use '-x'
(or filename suffixes) to tell 'gcc' where to start, and one of the
options '-c', '-S', or '-E' to say where 'gcc' is to stop.  Note that
some combinations (for example, '-x cpp-output -E') instruct 'gcc' to do
nothing at all.

'-c'
     Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
     stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
     object file for each source file.

     By default, the object file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix '.c', '.i', '.s', etc., with '.o'.

     Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly,
     are ignored.

'-S'
     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The
     output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
     non-assembler input file specified.

     By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix '.c', '.i', etc., with '.s'.

     Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

'-E'
     Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.
     The output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is
     sent to the standard output.

     Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.

'-o FILE'
     Place output in file FILE.  This applies to whatever sort of output
     is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object
     file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     If '-o' is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
     in 'a.out', the object file for 'SOURCE.SUFFIX' in 'SOURCE.o', its
     assembler file in 'SOURCE.s', a precompiled header file in
     'SOURCE.SUFFIX.gch', and all preprocessed C source on standard
     output.

'-v'
     Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the
     stages of compilation.  Also print the version number of the
     compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the compiler
     proper.

'-###'
     Like '-v' except the commands are not executed and arguments are
     quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or './-_'.
     This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated
     command lines.

'-pipe'
     Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
     various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems
     where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU
     assembler has no trouble.

'--help'
     Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
     options understood by 'gcc'.  If the '-v' option is also specified
     then '--help' is also passed on to the various processes invoked by
     'gcc', so that they can display the command-line options they
     accept.  If the '-Wextra' option has also been specified (prior to
     the '--help' option), then command-line options that have no
     documentation associated with them are also displayed.

'--target-help'
     Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific
     command-line options for each tool.  For some targets extra
     target-specific information may also be printed.

'--help={CLASS|[^]QUALIFIER}[,...]'
     Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
     options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified
     classes and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:

     'optimizers'
          Display all of the optimization options supported by the
          compiler.

     'warnings'
          Display all of the options controlling warning messages
          produced by the compiler.

     'target'
          Display target-specific options.  Unlike the '--target-help'
          option however, target-specific options of the linker and
          assembler are not displayed.  This is because those tools do
          not currently support the extended '--help=' syntax.

     'params'
          Display the values recognized by the '--param' option.

     LANGUAGE
          Display the options supported for LANGUAGE, where LANGUAGE is
          the name of one of the languages supported in this version of
          GCC.

     'common'
          Display the options that are common to all languages.

     These are the supported qualifiers:

     'undocumented'
          Display only those options that are undocumented.

     'joined'
          Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
          sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
          '--help=target'.

     'separate'
          Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate
          word following the original option, such as: '-o output-file'.

     Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
     switches supported by the compiler, use:

          --help=target,undocumented

     The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
     '^' character, so for example to display all binary warning options
     (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
     argument) that have a description, use:

          --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented

     The argument to '--help=' should not consist solely of inverted
     qualifiers.

     Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
     restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
     case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
     TARGET.  For example, to display all the target-specific
     optimization options, use:

          --help=target,optimizers

     The '--help=' option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
     successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
     those that have already been displayed.

     If the '-Q' option appears on the command line before the '--help='
     option, then the descriptive text displayed by '--help=' is
     changed.  Instead of describing the displayed options, an
     indication is given as to whether the option is enabled, disabled
     or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler knows this
     at the point where the '--help=' option is used).

     Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of 'gcc':

            % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
            The following options are target specific:
            -mabi=                                2
            -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
            -mapcs                                [disabled]

     The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
     options, so for example it is possible to find out which
     optimizations are enabled at '-O2' by using:

          -Q -O2 --help=optimizers

     Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are
     enabled by '-O3' by using:

          gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O3-opts
          gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers > /tmp/O2-opts
          diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled

'-no-canonical-prefixes'
     Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to '/../' or
     '/./', or make the path absolute when generating a relative prefix.

'--version'
     Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

'-wrapper'
     Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
     wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
     list.

          gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args

     This invokes all subprograms of 'gcc' under 'gdb --args', thus the
     invocation of 'cc1' is 'gdb --args cc1 ...'.

'-fplugin=NAME.so'
     Load the plugin code in file NAME.so, assumed to be a shared object
     to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of the shared object
     file is used to identify the plugin for the purposes of argument
     parsing (See '-fplugin-arg-NAME-KEY=VALUE' below).  Each plugin
     should define the callback functions specified in the Plugins API.

'-fplugin-arg-NAME-KEY=VALUE'
     Define an argument called KEY with a value of VALUE for the plugin
     called NAME.

'-fdump-ada-spec[-slim]'
     For C and C++ source and include files, generate corresponding Ada
     specs.  *Note (gnat_ugn)Generating Ada Bindings for C and C++
     headers::, which provides detailed documentation on this feature.

'-fada-spec-parent=UNIT'
     In conjunction with '-fdump-ada-spec[-slim]' above, generate Ada
     specs as child units of parent UNIT.

'-fdump-go-spec=FILE'
     For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
     declarations in FILE.  This generates Go 'const', 'type', 'var',
     and 'func' declarations which may be a useful way to start writing
     a Go interface to code written in some other language.

'@FILE'
     Read command-line options from FILE.  The options read are inserted
     in place of the original @FILE option.  If FILE does not exist, or
     cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
     removed.

     Options in FILE are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
     character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
     option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including
     a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
     included with a backslash.  The FILE may itself contain additional
     @FILE options; any such options will be processed recursively.

3.3 Compiling C++ Programs
==========================

C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes '.C', '.cc',
'.cpp', '.CPP', '.c++', '.cp', or '.cxx'; C++ header files often use
'.hh', '.hpp', '.H', or (for shared template code) '.tcc'; and
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix '.ii'.  GCC recognizes files with
these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the
compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with the name
'gcc').

 However, the use of 'gcc' does not add the C++ library.  'g++' is a
program that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking against the
C++ library.  It treats '.c', '.h' and '.i' files as C++ source files
instead of C source files unless '-x' is used.  This program is also
useful when precompiling a C header file with a '.h' extension for use
in C++ compilations.  On many systems, 'g++' is also installed with the
name 'c++'.

 When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.  *Note
Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options, for explanations of
options for languages related to C.  *Note Options Controlling C++
Dialect: C++ Dialect Options, for explanations of options that are
meaningful only for C++ programs.


File: gcc.info,  Node: C Dialect Options,  Next: C++ Dialect Options,  Prev: Invoking G++,  Up: Invoking GCC

3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect
=================================

The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:

'-ansi'
     In C mode, this is equivalent to '-std=c90'.  In C++ mode, it is
     equivalent to '-std=c++98'.

     This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with
     ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling
     C++ code), such as the 'asm' and 'typeof' keywords, and predefined
     macros such as 'unix' and 'vax' that identify the type of system
     you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and rarely used ISO
     trigraph feature.  For the C compiler, it disables recognition of
     C++ style '//' comments as well as the 'inline' keyword.

     The alternate keywords '__asm__', '__extension__', '__inline__' and
     '__typeof__' continue to work despite '-ansi'.  You would not want
     to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it is useful to put
     them in header files that might be included in compilations done
     with '-ansi'.  Alternate predefined macros such as '__unix__' and
     '__vax__' are also available, with or without '-ansi'.

     The '-ansi' option does not cause non-ISO programs to be rejected
     gratuitously.  For that, '-Wpedantic' is required in addition to
     '-ansi'.  *Note Warning Options::.

     The macro '__STRICT_ANSI__' is predefined when the '-ansi' option
     is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain from
     declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the ISO
     standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
     programs that might use these names for other things.

     Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
     defined by ISO C (such as 'alloca' and 'ffs') are not built-in
     functions when '-ansi' is used.  *Note Other built-in functions
     provided by GCC: Other Builtins, for details of the functions
     affected.

'-std='
     Determine the language standard.  *Note Language Standards
     Supported by GCC: Standards, for details of these standard
     versions.  This option is currently only supported when compiling C
     or C++.

     The compiler can accept several base standards, such as 'c90' or
     'c++98', and GNU dialects of those standards, such as 'gnu90' or
     'gnu++98'.  When a base standard is specified, the compiler accepts
     all programs following that standard plus those using GNU
     extensions that do not contradict it.  For example, '-std=c90'
     turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
     C90, such as the 'asm' and 'typeof' keywords, but not other GNU
     extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting
     the middle term of a '?:' expression.  On the other hand, when a
     GNU dialect of a standard is specified, all features supported by
     the compiler are enabled, even when those features change the
     meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some strict-conforming
     programs may be rejected.  The particular standard is used by
     '-Wpedantic' to identify which features are GNU extensions given
     that version of the standard.  For example '-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic'
     warns about C++ style '//' comments, while '-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic'
     does not.

     A value for this option must be provided; possible values are

     'c90'
     'c89'
     'iso9899:1990'
          Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that
          conflict with ISO C90 are disabled).  Same as '-ansi' for C
          code.

     'iso9899:199409'
          ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.

     'c99'
     'c9x'
     'iso9899:1999'
     'iso9899:199x'
          ISO C99.  This standard is substantially completely supported,
          modulo bugs, extended identifiers (supported except for corner
          cases when '-fextended-identifiers' is used) and
          floating-point issues (mainly but not entirely relating to
          optional C99 features from Annexes F and G). See <http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html>
          for more information.  The names 'c9x' and 'iso9899:199x' are
          deprecated.

     'c11'
     'c1x'
     'iso9899:2011'
          ISO C11, the 2011 revision of the ISO C standard.  This
          standard is substantially completely supported, modulo bugs,
          extended identifiers (supported except for corner cases when
          '-fextended-identifiers' is used), floating-point issues
          (mainly but not entirely relating to optional C11 features
          from Annexes F and G) and the optional Annexes K
          (Bounds-checking interfaces) and L (Analyzability).  The name
          'c1x' is deprecated.

     'gnu90'
     'gnu89'
          GNU dialect of ISO C90 (including some C99 features).  This is
          the default for C code.

     'gnu99'
     'gnu9x'
          GNU dialect of ISO C99.  The name 'gnu9x' is deprecated.

     'gnu11'
     'gnu1x'
          GNU dialect of ISO C11.  This is intended to become the
          default in a future release of GCC. The name 'gnu1x' is
          deprecated.

     'c++98'
     'c++03'
          The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus the 2003 technical corrigendum
          and some additional defect reports.  Same as '-ansi' for C++
          code.

     'gnu++98'
     'gnu++03'
          GNU dialect of '-std=c++98'.  This is the default for C++
          code.

     'c++11'
     'c++0x'
          The 2011 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.  The name 'c++0x'
          is deprecated.

     'gnu++11'
     'gnu++0x'
          GNU dialect of '-std=c++11'.  The name 'gnu++0x' is
          deprecated.

     'c++1y'
          The next revision of the ISO C++ standard, tentatively planned
          for 2014.  Support is highly experimental, and will almost
          certainly change in incompatible ways in future releases.

     'gnu++1y'
          GNU dialect of '-std=c++1y'.  Support is highly experimental,
          and will almost certainly change in incompatible ways in
          future releases.

'-fgnu89-inline'
     The option '-fgnu89-inline' tells GCC to use the traditional GNU
     semantics for 'inline' functions when in C99 mode.  *Note An Inline
     Function is As Fast As a Macro: Inline.  This option is accepted
     and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including 4.3.  In
     GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC in C99
     mode.  Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
     'gnu_inline' function attribute to all inline functions (*note
     Function Attributes::).

     The option '-fno-gnu89-inline' explicitly tells GCC to use the C99
     semantics for 'inline' when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
     specifies the default behavior).  This option was first supported
     in GCC 4.3.  This option is not supported in '-std=c90' or
     '-std=gnu90' mode.

     The preprocessor macros '__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__' and
     '__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__' may be used to check which semantics are in
     effect for 'inline' functions.  *Note (cpp)Common Predefined
     Macros::.

'-aux-info FILENAME'
     Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all
     functions declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including
     those in header files.  This option is silently ignored in any
     language other than C.

     Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin
     of each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration
     was implicit, prototyped or unprototyped ('I', 'N' for new or 'O'
     for old, respectively, in the first character after the line number
     and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
     definition ('C' or 'F', respectively, in the following character).
     In the case of function definitions, a K&R-style list of arguments
     followed by their declarations is also provided, inside comments,
     after the declaration.

'-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions'
     Accept variadic functions without named parameters.

     Although it is possible to define such a function, this is not very
     useful as it is not possible to read the arguments.  This is only
     supported for C as this construct is allowed by C++.

'-fno-asm'
     Do not recognize 'asm', 'inline' or 'typeof' as a keyword, so that
     code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use the keywords
     '__asm__', '__inline__' and '__typeof__' instead.  '-ansi' implies
     '-fno-asm'.

     In C++, this switch only affects the 'typeof' keyword, since 'asm'
     and 'inline' are standard keywords.  You may want to use the
     '-fno-gnu-keywords' flag instead, which has the same effect.  In
     C99 mode ('-std=c99' or '-std=gnu99'), this switch only affects the
     'asm' and 'typeof' keywords, since 'inline' is a standard keyword
     in ISO C99.

'-fno-builtin'
'-fno-builtin-FUNCTION'
     Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
     '__builtin_' as prefix.  *Note Other built-in functions provided by
     GCC: Other Builtins, for details of the functions affected,
     including those which are not built-in functions when '-ansi' or
     '-std' options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
     do not have an ISO standard meaning.

     GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in
     functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to 'alloca' may
     become single instructions which adjust the stack directly, and
     calls to 'memcpy' may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code
     is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no
     longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls,
     nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a
     different library.  In addition, when a function is recognized as a
     built-in function, GCC may use information about that function to
     warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate
     more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains
     calls to that function.  For example, warnings are given with
     '-Wformat' for bad calls to 'printf' when 'printf' is built in and
     'strlen' is known not to modify global memory.

     With the '-fno-builtin-FUNCTION' option only the built-in function
     FUNCTION is disabled.  FUNCTION must not begin with '__builtin_'.
     If a function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC,
     this option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
     '-fbuiltin-FUNCTION' option; if you wish to enable built-in
     functions selectively when using '-fno-builtin' or
     '-ffreestanding', you may define macros such as:

          #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
          #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

'-fhosted'

     Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies
     '-fbuiltin'.  A hosted environment is one in which the entire
     standard library is available, and in which 'main' has a return
     type of 'int'.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
     This is equivalent to '-fno-freestanding'.

'-ffreestanding'

     Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
     implies '-fno-builtin'.  A freestanding environment is one in which
     the standard library may not exist, and program startup may not
     necessarily be at 'main'.  The most obvious example is an OS
     kernel.  This is equivalent to '-fno-hosted'.

     *Note Language Standards Supported by GCC: Standards, for details
     of freestanding and hosted environments.

'-fopenmp'
     Enable handling of OpenMP directives '#pragma omp' in C/C++ and
     '!$omp' in Fortran.  When '-fopenmp' is specified, the compiler
     generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application Program
     Interface v4.0 <http://www.openmp.org/>.  This option implies
     '-pthread', and thus is only supported on targets that have support
     for '-pthread'.  '-fopenmp' implies '-fopenmp-simd'.

'-fopenmp-simd'
     Enable handling of OpenMP's SIMD directives with '#pragma omp' in
     C/C++ and '!$omp' in Fortran.  Other OpenMP directives are ignored.

'-fcilkplus'
     Enable the usage of Cilk Plus language extension features for
     C/C++.  When the option '-fcilkplus' is specified, enable the usage
     of the Cilk Plus Language extension features for C/C++.  The
     present implementation follows ABI version 1.2.  This is an
     experimental feature that is only partially complete, and whose
     interface may change in future versions of GCC as the official
     specification changes.  Currently, all features but '_Cilk_for'
     have been implemented.

'-fgnu-tm'
     When the option '-fgnu-tm' is specified, the compiler generates
     code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional Memory
     ABI specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is an
     experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions
     of GCC, as the official specification changes.  Please note that
     not all architectures are supported for this feature.

     For more information on GCC's support for transactional memory,
     *Note The GNU Transactional Memory Library: (libitm)Enabling
     libitm.

     Note that the transactional memory feature is not supported with
     non-call exceptions ('-fnon-call-exceptions').

'-fms-extensions'
     Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

     In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar
     to previous types declarations.

          typedef int UOW;
          struct ABC {
            UOW UOW;
          };

     Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
     accepted with this option.  *Note Unnamed struct/union fields
     within structs/unions: Unnamed Fields, for details.

     Note that this option is off for all targets but i?86 and x86_64
     targets using ms-abi.
'-fplan9-extensions'
     Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.

     This enables '-fms-extensions', permits passing pointers to
     structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers
     to elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to
     anonymous fields declared using a typedef.  *Note Unnamed
     struct/union fields within structs/unions: Unnamed Fields, for
     details.  This is only supported for C, not C++.

'-trigraphs'
     Support ISO C trigraphs.  The '-ansi' option (and '-std' options
     for strict ISO C conformance) implies '-trigraphs'.

'-traditional'
'-traditional-cpp'
     Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a
     pre-standard C compiler.  They are now only supported with the '-E'
     switch.  The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.
     See the GNU CPP manual for details.

'-fcond-mismatch'
     Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second
     and third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.
     This option is not supported for C++.

'-flax-vector-conversions'
     Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers
     of elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should
     not be used for new code.

'-funsigned-char'
     Let the type 'char' be unsigned, like 'unsigned char'.

     Each kind of machine has a default for what 'char' should be.  It
     is either like 'unsigned char' by default or like 'signed char' by
     default.

     Ideally, a portable program should always use 'signed char' or
     'unsigned char' when it depends on the signedness of an object.
     But many programs have been written to use plain 'char' and expect
     it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
     machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let
     you make such a program work with the opposite default.

     The type 'char' is always a distinct type from each of 'signed
     char' or 'unsigned char', even though its behavior is always just
     like one of those two.

'-fsigned-char'
     Let the type 'char' be signed, like 'signed char'.

     Note that this is equivalent to '-fno-unsigned-char', which is the
     negative form of '-funsigned-char'.  Likewise, the option
     '-fno-signed-char' is equivalent to '-funsigned-char'.

'-fsigned-bitfields'
'-funsigned-bitfields'
'-fno-signed-bitfields'
'-fno-unsigned-bitfields'
     These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned,
     when the declaration does not use either 'signed' or 'unsigned'.
     By default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent:
     the basic integer types such as 'int' are signed types.

3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect
===================================

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you might
compile a file 'firstClass.C' like this:

     g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C

In this example, only '-frepo' is an option meant only for C++ programs;
you can use the other options with any language supported by GCC.

 Here is a list of options that are _only_ for compiling C++ programs:

'-fabi-version=N'
     Use version N of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 2.

     Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to the C++
     ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
     will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.

     Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
     3.2.

     Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
     3.4.

     Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
     template argument.

     Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
     mangling for vector types.

     Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling
     of attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of
     a plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
     another parameter.

     Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
     behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template
     argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and -, and a class
     scope function used as a template argument.

     See also '-Wabi'.

'-fno-access-control'
     Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for
     working around bugs in the access control code.

'-fcheck-new'
     Check that the pointer returned by 'operator new' is non-null
     before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
     normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
     'operator new' only returns '0' if it is declared 'throw()', in
     which case the compiler always checks the return value even without
     this option.  In all other cases, when 'operator new' has a
     non-empty exception specification, memory exhaustion is signalled
     by throwing 'std::bad_alloc'.  See also 'new (nothrow)'.

'-fconstexpr-depth=N'
     Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr
     functions to N.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion
     during constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by
     the standard is 512.

'-fdeduce-init-list'
     Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
     'std::initializer_list' from a brace-enclosed initializer list,
     i.e.

          template <class T> auto forward(T t) -> decltype (realfn (t))
          {
            return realfn (t);
          }

          void f()
          {
            forward({1,2}); // call forward<std::initializer_list<int>>
          }

     This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
     originally proposed semantics for the C++11 standard, but was not
     part of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This
     option is deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of
     G++.

'-ffriend-injection'
     Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they
     are visible outside the scope of the class in which they are
     declared.  Friend functions were documented to work this way in the
     old Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1
     always worked that way.  However, in ISO C++ a friend function that
     is not declared in an enclosing scope can only be found using
     argument dependent lookup.  This option causes friends to be
     injected as they were in earlier releases.

     This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
     release of G++.

'-fno-elide-constructors'
     The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a
     temporary that is only used to initialize another object of the
     same type.  Specifying this option disables that optimization, and
     forces G++ to call the copy constructor in all cases.

'-fno-enforce-eh-specs'
     Don't generate code to check for violation of exception
     specifications at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard,
     but may be useful for reducing code size in production builds, much
     like defining 'NDEBUG'.  This does not give user code permission to
     throw exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the
     compiler still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing
     an unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

'-fextern-tls-init'
'-fno-extern-tls-init'
     The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow 'thread_local' and
     'threadprivate' variables to have dynamic (runtime) initialization.
     To support this, any use of such a variable goes through a wrapper
     function that performs any necessary initialization.  When the use
     and definition of the variable are in the same translation unit,
     this overhead can be optimized away, but when the use is in a
     different translation unit there is significant overhead even if
     the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If the
     programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
     non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
     because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
     variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
     another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
     '-fno-extern-tls-init' option.

     On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
     '-fextern-tls-init'.  On targets that do not support symbol
     aliases, the default is '-fno-extern-tls-init'.

'-ffor-scope'
'-fno-for-scope'
     If '-ffor-scope' is specified, the scope of variables declared in a
     for-init-statement is limited to the 'for' loop itself, as
     specified by the C++ standard.  If '-fno-for-scope' is specified,
     the scope of variables declared in a for-init-statement extends to
     the end of the enclosing scope, as was the case in old versions of
     G++, and other (traditional) implementations of C++.

     If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
     but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
     otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

'-fno-gnu-keywords'
     Do not recognize 'typeof' as a keyword, so that code can use this
     word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword '__typeof__'
     instead.  '-ansi' implies '-fno-gnu-keywords'.

'-fno-implicit-templates'
     Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
     implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit
     instantiations.  *Note Template Instantiation::, for more
     information.

'-fno-implicit-inline-templates'
     Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates,
     either.  The default is to handle inlines differently so that
     compiles with and without optimization need the same set of
     explicit instantiations.

'-fno-implement-inlines'
     To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
     controlled by '#pragma implementation'.  This causes linker errors
     if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

'-fms-extensions'
     Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as
     implicit int and getting a pointer to member function via
     non-standard syntax.

'-fno-nonansi-builtins'
     Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
     ANSI/ISO C.  These include 'ffs', 'alloca', '_exit', 'index',
     'bzero', 'conjf', and other related functions.

'-fnothrow-opt'
     Treat a 'throw()' exception specification as if it were a
     'noexcept' specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
     overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.
     If the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
     destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
     function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
     optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown
     out of a function with such an exception specification results in a
     call to 'terminate' rather than 'unexpected'.

'-fno-operator-names'
     Do not treat the operator name keywords 'and', 'bitand', 'bitor',
     'compl', 'not', 'or' and 'xor' as synonyms as keywords.

'-fno-optional-diags'
     Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need
     to issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the
     one for a name having multiple meanings within a class.

'-fpermissive'
     Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
     warnings.  Thus, using '-fpermissive' allows some nonconforming
     code to compile.

'-fno-pretty-templates'
     When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
     template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
     template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
     typenames in the signature (e.g.  'void f(T) [with T = int]' rather
     than 'void f(int)') so that it's clear which template is involved.
     When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
     template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match the
     default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
     behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather
     than easier, you can use '-fno-pretty-templates' to disable them.

'-frepo'
     Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option
     also implies '-fno-implicit-templates'.  *Note Template
     Instantiation::, for more information.

'-fno-rtti'
     Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
     functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
     ('dynamic_cast' and 'typeid').  If you don't use those parts of the
     language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
     exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it
     as needed.  The 'dynamic_cast' operator can still be used for casts
     that do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to 'void
     *' or to unambiguous base classes.

'-fstats'
     Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the
     compilation.  This information is generally only useful to the G++
     development team.

'-fstrict-enums'
     Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
     enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration
     (as defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value that can be
     represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all
     the enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program
     uses a cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated
     type.

'-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=N'
     Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
     warning or error to N.  The default value is 10.

'-ftemplate-depth=N'
     Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to N.  A
     limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
     endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO
     C++ conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater
     than 17 (changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as
     the compiler can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some
     situations.

'-fno-threadsafe-statics'
     Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
     ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use
     this option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need
     to be thread-safe.

'-fuse-cxa-atexit'
     Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with
     the '__cxa_atexit' function rather than the 'atexit' function.
     This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of
     static destructors, but only works if your C library supports
     '__cxa_atexit'.

'-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr'
     Don't use the '__cxa_get_exception_ptr' runtime routine.  This
     causes 'std::uncaught_exception' to be incorrect, but is necessary
     if the runtime routine is not available.

'-fvisibility-inlines-hidden'
     This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
     pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the
     two functions are taken in different shared objects.

     The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline
     methods with '__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))' so that they
     do not appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT
     indirection when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can
     have a dramatic effect on load and link times of a DSO as it
     massively reduces the size of the dynamic export table when the
     library makes heavy use of templates.

     The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
     methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static
     variables local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce
     that the function is defined in only one shared object.

     You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate
     the effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do
     want to compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might
     mark it as having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class
     with explicit visibility has no effect.

     Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this
     option as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library
     boundary.  *Note Template Instantiation::.

'-fvisibility-ms-compat'
     This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++
     linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

     The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

       1. It sets the default visibility to 'hidden', like
          '-fvisibility=hidden'.

       2. Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

       3. The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
          visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
          shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
          permitted when this option is not used.

     In new code it is better to use '-fvisibility=hidden' and export
     those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
     Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps
     accidentally, on the Visual Studio behavior.

     Among the consequences of these changes are that static data
     members of the same type with the same name but defined in
     different shared objects are different, so changing one does not
     change the other; and that pointers to function members defined in
     different shared objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is
     given, it is a violation of the ODR to define types with the same
     name differently.

'-fvtable-verify=STD|PREINIT|NONE'
     Turn on (or off, if using '-fvtable-verify=none') the security
     feature that verifies at runtime, for every virtual call that is
     made, that the vtable pointer through which the call is made is
     valid for the type of the object, and has not been corrupted or
     overwritten.  If an invalid vtable pointer is detected (at
     runtime), an error is reported and execution of the program is
     immediately halted.

     This option causes runtime data structures to be built, at program
     start up, for verifying the vtable pointers.  The options 'std' and
     'preinit' control the timing of when these data structures are
     built.  In both cases the data structures are built before
     execution reaches 'main'.  The '-fvtable-verify=std' causes these
     data structure to be built after the shared libraries have been
     loaded and initialized.  '-fvtable-verify=preinit' causes them to
     be built before the shared libraries have been loaded and
     initialized.

     If this option appears multiple times in the compiler line, with
     different values specified, 'none' will take highest priority over
     both 'std' and 'preinit'; 'preinit' will take priority over 'std'.

'-fvtv-debug'
     Causes debug versions of the runtime functions for the vtable
     verification feature to be called.  This assumes the
     '-fvtable-verify=std' or '-fvtable-verify=preinit' has been used.
     This flag will also cause the compiler to keep track of which
     vtable pointers it found for each class, and record that
     information in the file "vtv_set_ptr_data.log", in the dump file
     directory on the user's machine.

     Note: This feature APPENDS data to the log file.  If you want a
     fresh log file, be sure to delete any existing one.

'-fvtv-counts'
     This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
     '-fvtable-verify=std' or '-fvtable-verify=preinit', this causes the
     compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls it
     encountered and the number of verifications it inserted.  It also
     counts the number of calls to certain runtime library functions
     that it inserts.  This information, for each compilation unit, is
     written to a file named "vtv_count_data.log", in the dump_file
     directory on the user's machine.  It also counts the size of the
     vtable pointer sets for each class, and writes this information to
     "vtv_class_set_sizes.log" in the same directory.

     Note: This feature APPENDS data to the log files.  To get a fresh
     log files, be sure to delete any existing ones.

'-fno-weak'
     Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the
     linker.  By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.
     This option exists only for testing, and should not be used by
     end-users; it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This
     option may be removed in a future release of G++.

'-nostdinc++'
     Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific
     to C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This
     option is used when building the C++ library.)

 In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

'-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with
     the vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Although an effort has been made to
     warn about all such cases, there are probably some cases that are
     not warned about, even though G++ is generating incompatible code.
     There may also be cases where warnings are emitted even though the
     code that is generated is compatible.

     You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
     concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be
     binary compatible with code generated by other compilers.

     The known incompatibilities in '-fabi-version=2' (the default)
     include:

        * A template with a non-type template parameter of reference
          type is mangled incorrectly:
               extern int N;
               template <int &> struct S {};
               void n (S<N>) {2}

          This is fixed in '-fabi-version=3'.

        * SIMD vector types declared using '__attribute ((vector_size))'
          are mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for
          overloading of functions taking vectors of different sizes.

          The mangling is changed in '-fabi-version=4'.

     The known incompatibilities in '-fabi-version=1' include:

        * Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may
          attempt to pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For
          example:

               struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
               struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };

          In this case, G++ places 'B::f2' into the same byte as
          'A::f1'; other compilers do not.  You can avoid this problem
          by explicitly padding 'A' so that its size is a multiple of
          the byte size on your platform; that causes G++ and other
          compilers to lay out 'B' identically.

        * Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++
          does not use tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For
          example:

               struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
               struct B { B(); char c2; };
               struct C : public A, public virtual B {};

          In this case, G++ does not place 'B' into the tail-padding for
          'A'; other compilers do.  You can avoid this problem by
          explicitly padding 'A' so that its size is a multiple of its
          alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that causes G++ and
          other compilers to lay out 'C' identically.

        * Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater
          than that of their underlying types, when the bit-fields
          appear in a union.  For example:

               union U { int i : 4096; };

          Assuming that an 'int' does not have 4096 bits, G++ makes the
          union too small by the number of bits in an 'int'.

        * Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For
          example:

               struct A {};

               struct B {
                 A a;
                 virtual void f ();
               };

               struct C : public B, public A {};

          G++ places the 'A' base class of 'C' at a nonzero offset; it
          should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that
          the 'A' data member of 'B' is already at offset zero.

        * Names of template functions whose types involve 'typename' or
          template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.

               template <typename Q>
               void f(typename Q::X) {}

               template <template <typename> class Q>
               void f(typename Q<int>::X) {}

          Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

     It also warns about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI changes
     at this point include:

        * For SysV/x86-64, unions with 'long double' members are passed
          in memory as specified in psABI. For example:

               union U {
                 long double ld;
                 int i;
               };

          'union U' is always passed in memory.

'-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
     destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends
     nor public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no
     non-private methods, and there's at least one private member
     function that isn't a constructor or destructor.

'-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when 'delete' is used to destroy an instance of a class that
     has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor.  It is unsafe to
     delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base
     class if the base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This
     warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wliteral-suffix (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix
     which does not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming
     extension, GCC treats such suffixes as separate preprocessing
     tokens in order to maintain backwards compatibility with code that
     uses formatting macros from '<inttypes.h>'.  For example:

          #define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
          #include <inttypes.h>
          #include <stdio.h>

          int main() {
            int64_t i64 = 123;
            printf("My int64: %"PRId64"\n", i64);
          }

     In this case, 'PRId64' is treated as a separate preprocessing
     token.

     This warning is enabled by default.

'-Wnarrowing (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs within
     '{ }', e.g.

          int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int

     This flag is included in '-Wall' and '-Wc++11-compat'.

     With '-std=c++11', '-Wno-narrowing' suppresses the diagnostic
     required by the standard.  Note that this does not affect the
     meaning of well-formed code; narrowing conversions are still
     considered ill-formed in SFINAE context.

'-Wnoexcept (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a
     call to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
     specification (i.e.  'throw()' or 'noexcept') but is known by the
     compiler to never throw an exception.

'-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible
     non-virtual destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base
     class, in which case it is possible but unsafe to delete an
     instance of a derived class through a pointer to the class itself
     or base class.  This warning is automatically enabled if '-Weffc++'
     is specified.

'-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does
     not match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

          struct A {
            int i;
            int j;
            A(): j (0), i (1) { }
          };

     The compiler rearranges the member initializers for 'i' and 'j' to
     match the declaration order of the members, emitting a warning to
     that effect.  This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-fext-numeric-literals (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Accept imaginary, fixed-point, or machine-defined literal number
     suffixes as GNU extensions.  When this option is turned off these
     suffixes are treated as C++11 user-defined literal numeric
     suffixes.  This is on by default for all pre-C++11 dialects and all
     GNU dialects: '-std=c++98', '-std=gnu++98', '-std=gnu++11',
     '-std=gnu++1y'.  This option is off by default for ISO C++11
     onwards ('-std=c++11', ...).

 The following '-W...' options are not affected by '-Wall'.

'-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott
     Meyers' 'Effective C++' series of books:

        * Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for
          classes with dynamically-allocated memory.

        * Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

        * Have 'operator=' return a reference to '*this'.

        * Don't try to return a reference when you must return an
          object.

        * Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
          decrement operators.

        * Never overload '&&', '||', or ','.

     This option also enables '-Wnon-virtual-dtor', which is also one of
     the effective C++ recommendations.  However, the check is extended
     to warn about the lack of virtual destructor in accessible
     non-polymorphic bases classes too.

     When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
     headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use 'grep -v' to
     filter out those warnings.

'-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about the use of an uncasted 'NULL' as sentinel.  When
     compiling only with GCC this is a valid sentinel, as 'NULL' is
     defined to '__null'.  Although it is a null pointer constant rather
     than a null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a
     pointer.  But this use is not portable across different compilers.

'-Wno-non-template-friend (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
     within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template
     specification support in G++, if the name of the friend is an
     unqualified-id (i.e., 'friend foo(int)'), the C++ language
     specification demands that the friend declare or define an
     ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section 14.5.3).  Before G++
     implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids could be
     interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
     function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the
     default behavior for G++, '-Wnon-template-friend' allows the
     compiler to check existing code for potential trouble spots and is
     on by default.  This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
     '-Wno-non-template-friend', which keeps the conformant compiler
     code but disables the helpful warning.

'-Wold-style-cast (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used
     within a C++ program.  The new-style casts ('dynamic_cast',
     'static_cast', 'reinterpret_cast', and 'const_cast') are less
     vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.

'-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
     base class.  For example, in:

          struct A {
            virtual void f();
          };

          struct B: public A {
            void f(int);
          };

     the 'A' class version of 'f' is hidden in 'B', and code like:

          B* b;
          b->f();

     fails to compile.

'-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member
     function to a plain pointer.

'-Wsign-promo (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
     enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned
     type of the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
     unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

3.6 Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects
==============================================================

(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  *Note Language Standards Supported by GCC:
Standards, for references.)

 This section describes the command-line options that are only
meaningful for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs.  You can also use
most of the language-independent GNU compiler options.  For example, you
might compile a file 'some_class.m' like this:

     gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

In this example, '-fgnu-runtime' is an option meant only for Objective-C
and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

 Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language,
Objective-C compilations may also use options specific to the C
front-end (e.g., '-Wtraditional').  Similarly, Objective-C++
compilations may use C++-specific options (e.g., '-Wabi').

 Here is a list of options that are _only_ for compiling Objective-C and
Objective-C++ programs:

'-fconstant-string-class=CLASS-NAME'
     Use CLASS-NAME as the name of the class to instantiate for each
     literal string specified with the syntax '@"..."'.  The default
     class name is 'NXConstantString' if the GNU runtime is being used,
     and 'NSConstantString' if the NeXT runtime is being used (see
     below).  The '-fconstant-cfstrings' option, if also present,
     overrides the '-fconstant-string-class' setting and cause '@"..."'
     literals to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.

'-fgnu-runtime'
     Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
     runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

'-fnext-runtime'
     Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the
     default for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The
     macro '__NEXT_RUNTIME__' is predefined if (and only if) this option
     is used.

'-fno-nil-receivers'
     Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches ('[receiver
     message:arg]') in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
     not 'nil'.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
     runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction
     with the NeXT runtime and ABI version 0 or 1.

'-fobjc-abi-version=N'
     Use version N of the Objective-C ABI for the selected runtime.
     This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In
     that case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI without
     support for properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.
     Version 1 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for
     properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the
     modern (64-bit) ABI. If nothing is specified, the default is
     Version 0 on 32-bit target machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target
     machines.

'-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors'
     For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables
     is a C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so,
     synthesize a special '- (id) .cxx_construct' instance method which
     runs non-trivial default constructors on any such instance
     variables, in order, and then return 'self'.  Similarly, check if
     any instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
     destructor, and if so, synthesize a special '- (void)
     .cxx_destruct' method which runs all such default destructors, in
     reverse order.

     The '- (id) .cxx_construct' and '- (void) .cxx_destruct' methods
     thusly generated only operate on instance variables declared in the
     current Objective-C class, and not those inherited from
     superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C runtime
     to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance hierarchy.
     The '- (id) .cxx_construct' methods are invoked by the runtime
     immediately after a new object instance is allocated; the '- (void)
     .cxx_destruct' methods are invoked immediately before the runtime
     deallocates an object instance.

     As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and
     later has support for invoking the '- (id) .cxx_construct' and '-
     (void) .cxx_destruct' methods.

'-fobjc-direct-dispatch'
     Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
     accomplished via the comm page.

'-fobjc-exceptions'
     Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
     Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This
     option is required to use the Objective-C keywords '@try',
     '@throw', '@catch', '@finally' and '@synchronized'.  This option is
     available with both the GNU runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not
     available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and
     earlier).

'-fobjc-gc'
     Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++
     programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
     GNU runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
     does not require special compiler flags.

'-fobjc-nilcheck'
     For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a nil
     receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
     This is the default and can be disabled using '-fno-objc-nilcheck'.
     Class methods and super calls are never checked for nil in this way
     no matter what this flag is set to.  Currently this flag does
     nothing when the GNU runtime, or an older version of the NeXT
     runtime ABI, is used.

'-fobjc-std=objc1'
     Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
     recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only affects the Objective-C additions
     to the C/C++ language; it does not affect conformance to C/C++
     standards, which is controlled by the separate C/C++ dialect option
     flags.  When this option is used with the Objective-C or
     Objective-C++ compiler, any Objective-C syntax that is not
     recognized by GCC 4.0 is rejected.  This is useful if you need to
     make sure that your Objective-C code can be compiled with older
     versions of GCC.

'-freplace-objc-classes'
     Emit a special marker instructing 'ld(1)' not to statically link in
     the resulting object file, and allow 'dyld(1)' to load it in at run
     time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the
     Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, where the object file in question
     may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded in the course of program
     execution, without the need to restart the program itself.
     Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality is only available in
     conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.

'-fzero-link'
     When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily
     replaces calls to 'objc_getClass("...")' (when the name of the
     class is known at compile time) with static class references that
     get initialized at load time, which improves run-time performance.
     Specifying the '-fzero-link' flag suppresses this behavior and
     causes calls to 'objc_getClass("...")' to be retained.  This is
     useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows for individual
     class implementations to be modified during program execution.  The
     GNU runtime currently always retains calls to
     'objc_get_class("...")' regardless of command-line options.

'-gen-decls'
     Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file
     to a file named 'SOURCENAME.decl'.

'-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
     garbage collector.

'-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued
     for every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the
     class.  The default behavior is to issue a warning for every method
     not explicitly implemented in the class, even if a method
     implementation is inherited from the superclass.  If you use the
     '-Wno-protocol' option, then methods inherited from the superclass
     are considered to be implemented, and no warning is issued for
     them.

'-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector
     are found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list
     of methods in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a
     check is performed for each selector appearing in a
     '@selector(...)' expression, and a corresponding method for that
     selector has been found during compilation.  Because these checks
     scan the method table only at the end of compilation, these
     warnings are not produced if the final stage of compilation is not
     reached, for example because an error is found during compilation,
     or because the '-fsyntax-only' option is being used.

'-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return
     types are found for a given selector when attempting to send a
     message using this selector to a receiver of type 'id' or 'Class'.
     When this flag is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler
     omits such warnings if any differences found are confined to types
     that share the same size and alignment.

'-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if a '@selector(...)' expression referring to an undeclared
     selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
     method with that name has been declared before the '@selector(...)'
     expression, either explicitly in an '@interface' or '@protocol'
     declaration, or implicitly in an '@implementation' section.  This
     option always performs its checks as soon as a '@selector(...)'
     expression is found, while '-Wselector' only performs its checks in
     the final stage of compilation.  This also enforces the coding
     style convention that methods and selectors must be declared before
     being used.

'-print-objc-runtime-info'
     Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed
     by value, if any.

3.7 Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting
=====================================================

Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below to control the formatting algorithm for
diagnostic messages, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source
location information should be reported.  Note that some language front
ends may not honor these options.

'-fmessage-length=N'
     Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about N
     characters.  The default is 72 characters for 'g++' and 0 for the
     rest of the front ends supported by GCC.  If N is zero, then no
     line-wrapping is done; each error message appears on a single line.

'-fdiagnostics-show-location=once'
     Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
     messages reporter to emit source location information _once_; that
     is, in case the message is too long to fit on a single physical
     line and has to be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted
     (as prefix) again, over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.
     This is the default behavior.

'-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line'
     Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
     messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
     prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
     a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

'-fdiagnostics-color[=WHEN]'
'-fno-diagnostics-color'
     Use color in diagnostics.  WHEN is 'never', 'always', or 'auto'.
     The default is 'never' if 'GCC_COLORS' environment variable isn't
     present in the environment, and 'auto' otherwise.  'auto' means to
     use color only when the standard error is a terminal.  The forms
     '-fdiagnostics-color' and '-fno-diagnostics-color' are aliases for
     '-fdiagnostics-color=always' and '-fdiagnostics-color=never',
     respectively.

     The colors are defined by the environment variable 'GCC_COLORS'.
     Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select
     Graphic Rendition (SGR) substrings.  SGR commands are interpreted
     by the terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the
     documentation of your text terminal for permitted values and their
     meanings as character attributes.)  These substring values are
     integers in decimal representation and can be concatenated with
     semicolons.  Common values to concatenate include '1' for bold, '4'
     for underline, '5' for blink, '7' for inverse, '39' for default
     foreground color, '30' to '37' for foreground colors, '90' to '97'
     for 16-color mode foreground colors, '38;5;0' to '38;5;255' for
     88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, '49' for default
     background color, '40' to '47' for background colors, '100' to
     '107' for 16-color mode background colors, and '48;5;0' to
     '48;5;255' for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

     The default 'GCC_COLORS' is
     'error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:caret=01;32:locus=01:quote=01'
     where '01;31' is bold red, '01;35' is bold magenta, '01;36' is bold
     cyan, '01;32' is bold green and '01' is bold.  Setting 'GCC_COLORS'
     to the empty string disables colors.  Supported capabilities are as
     follows.

     'error='
          SGR substring for error: markers.

     'warning='
          SGR substring for warning: markers.

     'note='
          SGR substring for note: markers.

     'caret='
          SGR substring for caret line.

     'locus='
          SGR substring for location information, 'file:line' or
          'file:line:column' etc.

     'quote='
          SGR substring for information printed within quotes.

'-fno-diagnostics-show-option'
     By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
     command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such
     an option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
     '-fno-diagnostics-show-option' flag suppresses that behavior.

'-fno-diagnostics-show-caret'
     By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source
     line and a caret '^' indicating the column.  This option suppresses
     this information.

3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings
===========================================

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not
inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there may have been
an error.

 The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

'-fsyntax-only'
     Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond
     that.

'-fmax-errors=N'
     Limits the maximum number of error messages to N, at which point
     GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the
     source code.  If N is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the
     number of error messages produced.  If '-Wfatal-errors' is also
     specified, then '-Wfatal-errors' takes precedence over this option.

'-w'
     Inhibit all warning messages.

'-Werror'
     Make all warnings into errors.

'-Werror='
     Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a
     warning is appended; for example '-Werror=switch' turns the
     warnings controlled by '-Wswitch' into errors.  This switch takes a
     negative form, to be used to negate '-Werror' for specific
     warnings; for example '-Wno-error=switch' makes '-Wswitch' warnings
     not be errors, even when '-Werror' is in effect.

     The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
     option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used
     with '-Werror=' and '-Wno-error=' as described above.  (Printing of
     the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
     '-fno-diagnostics-show-option' flag.)

     Note that specifying '-Werror='FOO automatically implies '-W'FOO.
     However, '-Wno-error='FOO does not imply anything.

'-Wfatal-errors'
     This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first
     error occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing
     further error messages.

 You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
'-W', for example '-Wimplicit' to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning '-Wno-' to turn off warnings; for example,
'-Wno-implicit'.  This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever
is not the default.  For further language-specific options also refer to
*note C++ Dialect Options:: and *note Objective-C and Objective-C++
Dialect Options::.

 When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
'-Wunknown-warning'), GCC emits a diagnostic stating that the option is
not recognized.  However, if the '-Wno-' form is used, the behavior is
slightly different: no diagnostic is produced for '-Wno-unknown-warning'
unless other diagnostics are being produced.  This allows the use of new
'-Wno-' options with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the
compiler warns that an unrecognized option is present.

'-Wpedantic'
'-pedantic'
     Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject
     all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs
     that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
     version of the ISO C standard specified by any '-std' option used.

     Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or
     without this option (though a rare few require '-ansi' or a '-std'
     option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However, without
     this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
     features are supported as well.  With this option, they are
     rejected.

     '-Wpedantic' does not cause warning messages for use of the
     alternate keywords whose names begin and end with '__'.  Pedantic
     warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
     '__extension__'.  However, only system header files should use
     these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.  *Note
     Alternate Keywords::.

     Some users try to use '-Wpedantic' to check programs for strict ISO
     C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they
     want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all--only those for
     which ISO C _requires_ a diagnostic, and some others for which
     diagnostics have been added.

     A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful
     in some instances, but would require considerable additional work
     and would be quite different from '-Wpedantic'.  We don't have
     plans to support such a feature in the near future.

     Where the standard specified with '-std' represents a GNU extended
     dialect of C, such as 'gnu90' or 'gnu99', there is a corresponding
     "base standard", the version of ISO C on which the GNU extended
     dialect is based.  Warnings from '-Wpedantic' are given where they
     are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense for
     such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified
     GNU C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include
     all features the compiler supports with the given option, and there
     would be nothing to warn about.)

'-pedantic-errors'
     Like '-Wpedantic', except that errors are produced rather than
     warnings.

'-Wall'
     This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
     consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
     prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
     enables some language-specific warnings described in *note C++
     Dialect Options:: and *note Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
     Options::.

     '-Wall' turns on the following warning flags:

          -Waddress
          -Warray-bounds (only with -O2)
          -Wc++11-compat
          -Wchar-subscripts
          -Wenum-compare (in C/ObjC; this is on by default in C++)
          -Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only)
          -Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)
          -Wcomment
          -Wformat
          -Wmain (only for C/ObjC and unless -ffreestanding)
          -Wmaybe-uninitialized
          -Wmissing-braces (only for C/ObjC)
          -Wnonnull
          -Wopenmp-simd
          -Wparentheses
          -Wpointer-sign
          -Wreorder
          -Wreturn-type
          -Wsequence-point
          -Wsign-compare (only in C++)
          -Wstrict-aliasing
          -Wstrict-overflow=1
          -Wswitch
          -Wtrigraphs
          -Wuninitialized
          -Wunknown-pragmas
          -Wunused-function
          -Wunused-label
          -Wunused-value
          -Wunused-variable
          -Wvolatile-register-var


     Note that some warning flags are not implied by '-Wall'.  Some of
     them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
     questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
     others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid
     in some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to
     suppress the warning.  Some of them are enabled by '-Wextra' but
     many of them must be enabled individually.

'-Wextra'
     This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
     '-Wall'.  (This option used to be called '-W'.  The older name is
     still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

          -Wclobbered
          -Wempty-body
          -Wignored-qualifiers
          -Wmissing-field-initializers
          -Wmissing-parameter-type (C only)
          -Wold-style-declaration (C only)
          -Woverride-init
          -Wsign-compare
          -Wtype-limits
          -Wuninitialized
          -Wunused-parameter (only with -Wunused or -Wall)
          -Wunused-but-set-parameter (only with -Wunused or -Wall)


     The option '-Wextra' also prints warning messages for the following
     cases:

        * A pointer is compared against integer zero with '<', '<=',
          '>', or '>='.

        * (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a
          conditional expression.

        * (C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.

        * (C++ only) Subscripting an array that has been declared
          'register'.

        * (C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been
          declared 'register'.

        * (C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a derived
          class's copy constructor.

'-Wchar-subscripts'
     Warn if an array subscript has type 'char'.  This is a common cause
     of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on
     some machines.  This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wcomment'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence '/*' appears in a '/*'
     comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a '//' comment.
     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wno-coverage-mismatch'
     Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
     '-fprofile-use' option.  If a source file is changed between
     compiling with '-fprofile-gen' and with '-fprofile-use', the files
     with the profile feedback can fail to match the source file and GCC
     cannot use the profile feedback information.  By default, this
     warning is enabled and is treated as an error.
     '-Wno-coverage-mismatch' can be used to disable the warning or
     '-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch' can be used to disable the error.
     Disabling the error for this warning can result in poorly optimized
     code and is useful only in the case of very minor changes such as
     bug fixes to an existing code-base.  Completely disabling the
     warning is not recommended.

'-Wno-cpp'
     (C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)

     Suppress warning messages emitted by '#warning' directives.

'-Wdouble-promotion (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Give a warning when a value of type 'float' is implicitly promoted
     to 'double'.  CPUs with a 32-bit "single-precision" floating-point
     unit implement 'float' in hardware, but emulate 'double' in
     software.  On such a machine, doing computations using 'double'
     values is much more expensive because of the overhead required for
     software emulation.

     It is easy to accidentally do computations with 'double' because
     floating-point literals are implicitly of type 'double'.  For
     example, in:
          float area(float radius)
          {
             return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
          }
     the compiler performs the entire computation with 'double' because
     the floating-point literal is a 'double'.

'-Wformat'
'-Wformat=N'
     Check calls to 'printf' and 'scanf', etc., to make sure that the
     arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
     specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string
     make sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified
     by format attributes (*note Function Attributes::), in the
     'printf', 'scanf', 'strftime' and 'strfmon' (an X/Open extension,
     not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific
     families).  Which functions are checked without format attributes
     having been specified depends on the standard version selected, and
     such checks of functions without the attribute specified are
     disabled by '-ffreestanding' or '-fno-builtin'.

     The formats are checked against the format features supported by
     GNU libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features,
     as well as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD
     and GNU extensions.  Other library implementations may not support
     all these features; GCC does not support warning about features
     that go beyond a particular library's limitations.  However, if
     '-Wpedantic' is used with '-Wformat', warnings are given about
     format features not in the selected standard version (but not for
     'strfmon' formats, since those are not in any version of the C
     standard).  *Note Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

     '-Wformat=1'
     '-Wformat'
          Option '-Wformat' is equivalent to '-Wformat=1', and
          '-Wno-format' is equivalent to '-Wformat=0'.  Since '-Wformat'
          also checks for null format arguments for several functions,
          '-Wformat' also implies '-Wnonnull'.  Some aspects of this
          level of format checking can be disabled by the options:
          '-Wno-format-contains-nul', '-Wno-format-extra-args', and
          '-Wno-format-zero-length'.  '-Wformat' is enabled by '-Wall'.

     '-Wno-format-contains-nul'
          If '-Wformat' is specified, do not warn about format strings
          that contain NUL bytes.

     '-Wno-format-extra-args'
          If '-Wformat' is specified, do not warn about excess arguments
          to a 'printf' or 'scanf' format function.  The C standard
          specifies that such arguments are ignored.

          Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
          specified with '$' operand number specifications, normally
          warnings are still given, since the implementation could not
          know what type to pass to 'va_arg' to skip the unused
          arguments.  However, in the case of 'scanf' formats, this
          option suppresses the warning if the unused arguments are all
          pointers, since the Single Unix Specification says that such
          unused arguments are allowed.

     '-Wno-format-zero-length'
          If '-Wformat' is specified, do not warn about zero-length
          formats.  The C standard specifies that zero-length formats
          are allowed.

     '-Wformat=2'
          Enable '-Wformat' plus additional format checks.  Currently
          equivalent to '-Wformat -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security
          -Wformat-y2k'.

     '-Wformat-nonliteral'
          If '-Wformat' is specified, also warn if the format string is
          not a string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the
          format function takes its format arguments as a 'va_list'.

     '-Wformat-security'
          If '-Wformat' is specified, also warn about uses of format
          functions that represent possible security problems.  At
          present, this warns about calls to 'printf' and 'scanf'
          functions where the format string is not a string literal and
          there are no format arguments, as in 'printf (foo);'.  This
          may be a security hole if the format string came from
          untrusted input and contains '%n'.  (This is currently a
          subset of what '-Wformat-nonliteral' warns about, but in
          future warnings may be added to '-Wformat-security' that are
          not included in '-Wformat-nonliteral'.)

     '-Wformat-y2k'
          If '-Wformat' is specified, also warn about 'strftime' formats
          that may yield only a two-digit year.

'-Wnonnull'
     Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as requiring
     a non-null value by the 'nonnull' function attribute.

     '-Wnonnull' is included in '-Wall' and '-Wformat'.  It can be
     disabled with the '-Wno-nonnull' option.

'-Winit-self (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with
     themselves.  Note this option can only be used with the
     '-Wuninitialized' option.

     For example, GCC warns about 'i' being uninitialized in the
     following snippet only when '-Winit-self' has been specified:
          int f()
          {
            int i = i;
            return i;
          }

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall' in C++.

'-Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.  This warning is
     enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)'
     Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared.
     In C99 mode ('-std=c99' or '-std=gnu99'), this warning is enabled
     by default and it is made into an error by '-pedantic-errors'.
     This warning is also enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wimplicit (C and Objective-C only)'
     Same as '-Wimplicit-int' and '-Wimplicit-function-declaration'.
     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++ only)'
     Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier such as
     'const'.  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect, since the
     value returned by a function is not an lvalue.  For C++, the
     warning is only emitted for scalar types or 'void'.  ISO C
     prohibits qualified 'void' return types on function definitions, so
     such return types always receive a warning even without this
     option.

     This warning is also enabled by '-Wextra'.

'-Wmain'
     Warn if the type of 'main' is suspicious.  'main' should be a
     function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
     arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This
     warning is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by either
     '-Wall' or '-Wpedantic'.

'-Wmissing-braces'
     Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.
     In the following example, the initializer for 'a' is not fully
     bracketed, but that for 'b' is fully bracketed.  This warning is
     enabled by '-Wall' in C.

          int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
          int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.

'-Wparentheses'
     Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when
     there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is
     expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
     often get confused about.

     Also warn if a comparison like 'x<=y<=z' appears; this is
     equivalent to '(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z', which is a different
     interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

     Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
     'if' statement an 'else' branch belongs.  Here is an example of
     such a case:

          {
            if (a)
              if (b)
                foo ();
            else
              bar ();
          }

     In C/C++, every 'else' branch belongs to the innermost possible
     'if' statement, which in this example is 'if (b)'.  This is often
     not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
     example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
     potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag
     is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
     the innermost 'if' statement so there is no way the 'else' can
     belong to the enclosing 'if'.  The resulting code looks like this:

          {
            if (a)
              {
                if (b)
                  foo ();
                else
                  bar ();
              }
          }

     Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to '?:' with
     omitted middle operand.  When the condition in the '?': operator is
     a boolean expression, the omitted value is always 1.  Often
     programmers expect it to be a value computed inside the conditional
     expression instead.

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wsequence-point'
     Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of
     violations of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

     The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a
     C/C++ program are evaluated in terms of "sequence points", which
     represent a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the
     program: those executed before the sequence point, and those
     executed after it.  These occur after the evaluation of a full
     expression (one which is not part of a larger expression), after
     the evaluation of the first operand of a '&&', '||', '? :' or ','
     (comma) operator, before a function is called (but after the
     evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the called
     function), and in certain other places.  Other than as expressed by
     the sequence point rules, the order of evaluation of subexpressions
     of an expression is not specified.  All these rules describe only a
     partial order rather than a total order, since, for example, if two
     functions are called within one expression with no sequence point
     between them, the order in which the functions are called is not
     specified.  However, the standards committee have ruled that
     function calls do not overlap.

     It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to
     the values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends
     on this have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify
     that "Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall
     have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
     expression.  Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to
     determine the value to be stored.".  If a program breaks these
     rules, the results on any particular implementation are entirely
     unpredictable.

     Examples of code with undefined behavior are 'a = a++;', 'a[n] =
     b[n++]' and 'a[i++] = i;'.  Some more complicated cases are not
     diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false
     positive result, but in general it has been found fairly effective
     at detecting this sort of problem in programs.

     The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
     over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle
     cases.  Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed
     formal definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
     <http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html>.

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall' for C and C++.

'-Wno-return-local-addr'
     Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in C++, a reference) to a
     variable that goes out of scope after the function returns.

'-Wreturn-type'
     Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that
     defaults to 'int'.  Also warn about any 'return' statement with no
     return value in a function whose return type is not 'void' (falling
     off the end of the function body is considered returning without a
     value), and about a 'return' statement with an expression in a
     function whose return type is 'void'.

     For C++, a function without return type always produces a
     diagnostic message, even when '-Wno-return-type' is specified.  The
     only exceptions are 'main' and functions defined in system headers.

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wswitch'
     Warn whenever a 'switch' statement has an index of enumerated type
     and lacks a 'case' for one or more of the named codes of that
     enumeration.  (The presence of a 'default' label prevents this
     warning.)  'case' labels outside the enumeration range also provoke
     warnings when this option is used (even if there is a 'default'
     label).  This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wswitch-default'
     Warn whenever a 'switch' statement does not have a 'default' case.

'-Wswitch-enum'
     Warn whenever a 'switch' statement has an index of enumerated type
     and lacks a 'case' for one or more of the named codes of that
     enumeration.  'case' labels outside the enumeration range also
     provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
     between '-Wswitch' and this option is that this option gives a
     warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
     'default' label.

'-Wsync-nand (C and C++ only)'
     Warn when '__sync_fetch_and_nand' and '__sync_nand_and_fetch'
     built-in functions are used.  These functions changed semantics in
     GCC 4.4.

'-Wtrigraphs'
     Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the meaning
     of the program (trigraphs within comments are not warned about).
     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wunused-but-set-parameter'
     Warn whenever a function parameter is assigned to, but otherwise
     unused (aside from its declaration).

     To suppress this warning use the 'unused' attribute (*note Variable
     Attributes::).

     This warning is also enabled by '-Wunused' together with '-Wextra'.

'-Wunused-but-set-variable'
     Warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise unused
     (aside from its declaration).  This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

     To suppress this warning use the 'unused' attribute (*note Variable
     Attributes::).

     This warning is also enabled by '-Wunused', which is enabled by
     '-Wall'.

'-Wunused-function'
     Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a
     non-inline static function is unused.  This warning is enabled by
     '-Wall'.

'-Wunused-label'
     Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.  This warning is
     enabled by '-Wall'.

     To suppress this warning use the 'unused' attribute (*note Variable
     Attributes::).

'-Wunused-local-typedefs (C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a typedef locally defined in a function is not used.
     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wunused-parameter'
     Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its
     declaration.

     To suppress this warning use the 'unused' attribute (*note Variable
     Attributes::).

'-Wno-unused-result'
     Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
     'warn_unused_result' (*note Function Attributes::) does not use its
     return value.  The default is '-Wunused-result'.

'-Wunused-variable'
     Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is
     unused aside from its declaration.  This warning is enabled by
     '-Wall'.

     To suppress this warning use the 'unused' attribute (*note Variable
     Attributes::).

'-Wunused-value'
     Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
     used.  To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
     'void'.  This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
     side of a comma expression that contains no side effects.  For
     example, an expression such as 'x[i,j]' causes a warning, while
     'x[(void)i,j]' does not.

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wunused'
     All the above '-Wunused' options combined.

     In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you
     must either specify '-Wextra -Wunused' (note that '-Wall' implies
     '-Wunused'), or separately specify '-Wunused-parameter'.

'-Wuninitialized'
     Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being
     initialized or if a variable may be clobbered by a 'setjmp' call.
     In C++, warn if a non-static reference or non-static 'const' member
     appears in a class without constructors.

     If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of
     the variable in its own initializer, use the '-Winit-self' option.

     These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
     elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
     variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
     not occur for variables or elements declared 'volatile'.  Because
     these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or
     elements for which there are warnings depends on the precise
     optimization options and version of GCC used.

     Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used
     only to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
     computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the
     warnings are printed.

'-Wmaybe-uninitialized'
     For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
     entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
     some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the
     compiler emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths
     are not executed at run time.  These warnings are made optional
     because GCC is not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code
     might be correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is
     one example of how this can happen:

          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {
              case 1: x = 1;
                break;
              case 2: x = 4;
                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }

     If the value of 'y' is always 1, 2 or 3, then 'x' is always
     initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  To suppress the warning,
     you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or similar code.

     This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might
     be changed by a call to 'longjmp'.  These warnings as well are
     possible only in optimizing compilation.

     The compiler sees only the calls to 'setjmp'.  It cannot know where
     'longjmp' will be called; in fact, a signal handler could call it
     at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning even
     when there is in fact no problem because 'longjmp' cannot in fact
     be called at the place that would cause a problem.

     Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the
     functions you use that never return as 'noreturn'.  *Note Function
     Attributes::.

     This warning is enabled by '-Wall' or '-Wextra'.

'-Wunknown-pragmas'
     Warn when a '#pragma' directive is encountered that is not
     understood by GCC.  If this command-line option is used, warnings
     are even issued for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This
     is not the case if the warnings are only enabled by the '-Wall'
     command-line option.

'-Wno-pragmas'
     Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
     invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
     '-Wunknown-pragmas'.

'-Wstrict-aliasing'
     This option is only active when '-fstrict-aliasing' is active.  It
     warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that
     the compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch
     all cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It
     is included in '-Wall'.  It is equivalent to '-Wstrict-aliasing=3'

'-Wstrict-aliasing=n'
     This option is only active when '-fstrict-aliasing' is active.  It
     warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that
     the compiler is using for optimization.  Higher levels correspond
     to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).  Higher levels also
     correspond to more effort, similar to the way '-O' works.
     '-Wstrict-aliasing' is equivalent to '-Wstrict-aliasing=3'.

     Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.  Possibly useful
     when higher levels do not warn but '-fstrict-aliasing' still breaks
     the code, as it has very few false negatives.  However, it has many
     false positives.  Warns for all pointer conversions between
     possibly incompatible types, even if never dereferenced.  Runs in
     the front end only.

     Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.  May still have many
     false positives (not as many as level 1 though), and few false
     negatives (but possibly more than level 1).  Unlike level 1, it
     only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about incomplete types.
     Runs in the front end only.

     Level 3 (default for '-Wstrict-aliasing'): Should have very few
     false positives and few false negatives.  Slightly slower than
     levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.  Takes care of the
     common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
     '*(int*)&some_float'.  If optimization is enabled, it also runs in
     the back end, where it deals with multiple statement cases using
     flow-sensitive points-to information.  Only warns when the
     converted pointer is dereferenced.  Does not warn about incomplete
     types.

'-Wstrict-overflow'
'-Wstrict-overflow=N'
     This option is only active when '-fstrict-overflow' is active.  It
     warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
     assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does
     not warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only
     warns about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.
     Thus this warning depends on the optimization level.

     An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
     perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such
     that overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning
     can easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
     actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
     warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
     undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a
     loop requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will
     be executed at all.

     '-Wstrict-overflow=1'
          Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.
          For example, with '-fstrict-overflow', the compiler simplifies
          'x + 1 > x' to '1'.  This level of '-Wstrict-overflow' is
          enabled by '-Wall'; higher levels are not, and must be
          explicitly requested.

     '-Wstrict-overflow=2'
          Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified
          to a constant.  For example: 'abs (x) >= 0'.  This can only be
          simplified when '-fstrict-overflow' is in effect, because 'abs
          (INT_MIN)' overflows to 'INT_MIN', which is less than zero.
          '-Wstrict-overflow' (with no level) is the same as
          '-Wstrict-overflow=2'.

     '-Wstrict-overflow=3'
          Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.
          For example: 'x + 1 > 1' is simplified to 'x > 0'.

     '-Wstrict-overflow=4'
          Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above
          cases.  For example: '(x * 10) / 5' is simplified to 'x * 2'.

     '-Wstrict-overflow=5'
          Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude
          of a constant involved in a comparison.  For example: 'x + 2 >
          y' is simplified to 'x + 1 >= y'.  This is reported only at
          the highest warning level because this simplification applies
          to many comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large
          number of false positives.

'-Wsuggest-attribute=[pure|const|noreturn|format]'
     Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial.  The
     attributes currently supported are listed below.

     '-Wsuggest-attribute=pure'
     '-Wsuggest-attribute=const'
     '-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn'

          Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
          'pure', 'const' or 'noreturn'.  The compiler only warns for
          functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case
          of 'pure' and 'const') if it cannot prove that the function
          returns normally.  A function returns normally if it doesn't
          contain an infinite loop or return abnormally by throwing,
          calling 'abort()' or trapping.  This analysis requires option
          '-fipa-pure-const', which is enabled by default at '-O' and
          higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy of
          the analysis.

     '-Wsuggest-attribute=format'
     '-Wmissing-format-attribute'

          Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for
          'format' attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates,
          not absolute ones.  GCC guesses that function pointers with
          'format' attributes that are used in assignment,
          initialization, parameter passing or return statements should
          have a corresponding 'format' attribute in the resulting type.
          I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or initialization,
          the type of the parameter variable, or the return type of the
          containing function respectively should also have a 'format'
          attribute to avoid the warning.

          GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
          candidates for 'format' attributes.  Again, these are only
          possible candidates.  GCC guesses that 'format' attributes
          might be appropriate for any function that calls a function
          like 'vprintf' or 'vscanf', but this might not always be the
          case, and some functions for which 'format' attributes are
          appropriate may not be detected.

'-Warray-bounds'
     This option is only active when '-ftree-vrp' is active (default for
     '-O2' and above).  It warns about subscripts to arrays that are
     always out of bounds.  This warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wno-div-by-zero'
     Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.
     Floating-point division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a
     legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

'-Wsystem-headers'
     Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
     Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the
     assumption that they usually do not indicate real problems and
     would only make the compiler output harder to read.  Using this
     command-line option tells GCC to emit warnings from system headers
     as if they occurred in user code.  However, note that using '-Wall'
     in conjunction with this option does _not_ warn about unknown
     pragmas in system headers--for that, '-Wunknown-pragmas' must also
     be used.

'-Wtrampolines'
     Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.

     A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at
     run time on the stack when the address of a nested function is
     taken, and is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For
     some targets, it is made up of data only and thus requires no
     special treatment.  But, for most targets, it is made up of code
     and thus requires the stack to be made executable in order for the
     program to work properly.

'-Wfloat-equal'
     Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.

     The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
     programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
     infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you
     need to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the
     maximum or likely maximum error that the computation introduces,
     and allow for it when performing comparisons (and when producing
     output, but that's a different problem).  In particular, instead of
     testing for equality, you should check to see whether the two
     values have ranges that overlap; and this is done with the
     relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably
     mistaken.

'-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have
     no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that
     should be avoided.

        * Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the
          macro body.  In traditional C macro replacement takes place
          within string literals, but in ISO C it does not.

        * In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
          Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a
          directive if the '#' appeared in column 1 on the line.
          Therefore '-Wtraditional' warns about directives that
          traditional C understands but ignores because the '#' does not
          appear as the first character on the line.  It also suggests
          you hide directives like '#pragma' not understood by
          traditional C by indenting them.  Some traditional
          implementations do not recognize '#elif', so this option
          suggests avoiding it altogether.

        * A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

        * The unary plus operator.

        * The 'U' integer constant suffix, or the 'F' or 'L'
          floating-point constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support
          the 'L' suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes
          appear in macros defined in the system headers of most modern
          systems, e.g. the '_MIN'/'_MAX' macros in '<limits.h>'.  Use
          of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
          warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough
          context to avoid warning in these cases.

        * A function declared external in one block and then used after
          the end of the block.

        * A 'switch' statement has an operand of type 'long'.

        * A non-'static' function declaration follows a 'static' one.
          This construct is not accepted by some traditional C
          compilers.

        * The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
          signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only
          issued if the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal
          or octal values, which typically represent bit patterns, are
          not warned about.

        * Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

        * Initialization of automatic aggregates.

        * Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a
          separate namespace for labels.

        * Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the
          warning is omitted.  This is done under the assumption that
          the zero initializer in user code appears conditioned on e.g.
          '__STDC__' to avoid missing initializer warnings and relies on
          default initialization to zero in the traditional C case.

        * Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values
          and vice versa.  The absence of these prototypes when
          compiling with traditional C causes serious problems.  This is
          a subset of the possible conversion warnings; for the full set
          use '-Wtraditional-conversion'.

        * Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning
          intentionally is _not_ issued for prototype declarations or
          variadic functions because these ISO C features appear in your
          code when using libiberty's traditional C compatibility
          macros, 'PARAMS' and 'VPARAMS'.  This warning is also bypassed
          for nested functions because that feature is already a GCC
          extension and thus not relevant to traditional C
          compatibility.

'-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from
     what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
     prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating
     and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness of
     a fixed-point argument except when the same as the default
     promotion.

'-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.
     This construct, known from C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is
     by default allowed in GCC.  It is not supported by ISO C90 and was
     not supported by GCC versions before GCC 3.0.  *Note Mixed
     Declarations::.

'-Wundef'
     Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an '#if' directive.

'-Wno-endif-labels'
     Do not warn whenever an '#else' or an '#endif' are followed by
     text.

'-Wshadow'
     Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another
     variable, parameter, type, or class member (in C++), or whenever a
     built-in function is shadowed.  Note that in C++, the compiler
     warns if a local variable shadows an explicit typedef, but not if
     it shadows a struct/class/enum.

'-Wlarger-than=LEN'
     Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.

'-Wframe-larger-than=LEN'
     Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than LEN bytes.  The
     computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate
     and not conservative.  The actual requirements may be somewhat
     greater than LEN even if you do not get a warning.  In addition,
     any space allocated via 'alloca', variable-length arrays, or
     related constructs is not included by the compiler when determining
     whether or not to issue a warning.

'-Wno-free-nonheap-object'
     Do not warn when attempting to free an object that was not
     allocated on the heap.

'-Wstack-usage=LEN'
     Warn if the stack usage of a function might be larger than LEN
     bytes.  The computation done to determine the stack usage is
     conservative.  Any space allocated via 'alloca', variable-length
     arrays, or related constructs is included by the compiler when
     determining whether or not to issue a warning.

     The message is in keeping with the output of '-fstack-usage'.

        * If the stack usage is fully static but exceeds the specified
          amount, it's:

                 warning: stack usage is 1120 bytes
        * If the stack usage is (partly) dynamic but bounded, it's:

                 warning: stack usage might be 1648 bytes
        * If the stack usage is (partly) dynamic and not bounded, it's:

                 warning: stack usage might be unbounded

'-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations'
     Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler cannot
     assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.  With
     '-funsafe-loop-optimizations' warn if the compiler makes such
     assumptions.

'-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW targets only)'
     When used in combination with '-Wformat' and '-pedantic' without
     GNU extensions, this option disables the warnings about non-ISO
     'printf' / 'scanf' format width specifiers 'I32', 'I64', and 'I'
     used on Windows targets, which depend on the MS runtime.

'-Wpointer-arith'
     Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type
     or of 'void'.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
     convenience in calculations with 'void *' pointers and pointers to
     functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
     'NULL'.  This warning is also enabled by '-Wpedantic'.

'-Wtype-limits'
     Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the
     limited range of the data type, but do not warn for constant
     expressions.  For example, warn if an unsigned variable is compared
     against zero with '<' or '>='.  This warning is also enabled by
     '-Wextra'.

'-Wbad-function-cast (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For
     example, warn if 'int malloc()' is cast to 'anything *'.

'-Wc++-compat (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common subset
     of ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit conversion from
     'void *' to a pointer to non-'void' type.

'-Wc++11-compat (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO C++
     1998 and ISO C++ 2011, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998 that are
     keywords in ISO C++ 2011.  This warning turns on '-Wnarrowing' and
     is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wcast-qual'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier
     from the target type.  For example, warn if a 'const char *' is
     cast to an ordinary 'char *'.

     Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an
     unsafe way.  For example, casting 'char **' to 'const char **' is
     unsafe, as in this example:

            /* p is char ** value.  */
            const char **q = (const char **) p;
            /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */
            *q = "string";
            /* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */
            **p = 'b';

'-Wcast-align'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of
     the target is increased.  For example, warn if a 'char *' is cast
     to an 'int *' on machines where integers can only be accessed at
     two- or four-byte boundaries.

'-Wwrite-strings'
     When compiling C, give string constants the type 'const
     char[LENGTH]' so that copying the address of one into a non-'const'
     'char *' pointer produces a warning.  These warnings help you find
     at compile time code that can try to write into a string constant,
     but only if you have been very careful about using 'const' in
     declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is just a nuisance.
     This is why we did not make '-Wall' request these warnings.

     When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from
     string literals to 'char *'.  This warning is enabled by default
     for C++ programs.

'-Wclobbered'
     Warn for variables that might be changed by 'longjmp' or 'vfork'.
     This warning is also enabled by '-Wextra'.

'-Wconditionally-supported (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn for conditionally-supported (C++11 [intro.defs]) constructs.

'-Wconversion'
     Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value.  This
     includes conversions between real and integer, like 'abs (x)' when
     'x' is 'double'; conversions between signed and unsigned, like
     'unsigned ui = -1'; and conversions to smaller types, like 'sqrtf
     (M_PI)'.  Do not warn for explicit casts like 'abs ((int) x)' and
     'ui = (unsigned) -1', or if the value is not changed by the
     conversion like in 'abs (2.0)'.  Warnings about conversions between
     signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by using
     '-Wno-sign-conversion'.

     For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for
     user-defined conversions; and conversions that never use a type
     conversion operator: conversions to 'void', the same type, a base
     class or a reference to them.  Warnings about conversions between
     signed and unsigned integers are disabled by default in C++ unless
     '-Wsign-conversion' is explicitly enabled.

'-Wno-conversion-null (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Do not warn for conversions between 'NULL' and non-pointer types.
     '-Wconversion-null' is enabled by default.

'-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when a literal '0' is used as null pointer constant.  This can
     be useful to facilitate the conversion to 'nullptr' in C++11.

'-Wdate-time'
     Warn when macros '__TIME__', '__DATE__' or '__TIMESTAMP__' are
     encountered as they might prevent bit-wise-identical reproducible
     compilations.

'-Wdelete-incomplete (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when deleting a pointer to incomplete type, which may cause
     undefined behavior at runtime.  This warning is enabled by default.

'-Wuseless-cast (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.

'-Wempty-body'
     Warn if an empty body occurs in an 'if', 'else' or 'do while'
     statement.  This warning is also enabled by '-Wextra'.

'-Wenum-compare'
     Warn about a comparison between values of different enumerated
     types.  In C++ enumeral mismatches in conditional expressions are
     also diagnosed and the warning is enabled by default.  In C this
     warning is enabled by '-Wall'.

'-Wjump-misses-init (C, Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a 'goto' statement or a 'switch' statement jumps forward
     across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
     label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns
     about variables that are initialized when they are declared.  This
     warning is only supported for C and Objective-C; in C++ this sort
     of branch is an error in any case.

     '-Wjump-misses-init' is included in '-Wc++-compat'.  It can be
     disabled with the '-Wno-jump-misses-init' option.

'-Wsign-compare'
     Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could
     produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to
     unsigned.  This warning is also enabled by '-Wextra'; to get the
     other warnings of '-Wextra' without this warning, use '-Wextra
     -Wno-sign-compare'.

'-Wsign-conversion'
     Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an
     integer value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an
     unsigned integer variable.  An explicit cast silences the warning.
     In C, this option is enabled also by '-Wconversion'.

'-Wfloat-conversion'
     Warn for implicit conversions that reduce the precision of a real
     value.  This includes conversions from real to integer, and from
     higher precision real to lower precision real values.  This option
     is also enabled by '-Wconversion'.

'-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess'
     Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory
     built-in functions if the argument uses 'sizeof'.  This warning
     warns e.g. about 'memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));' if 'ptr' is not
     an array, but a pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about
     'memcpy (&foo, ptr, sizeof (&foo));'.  This warning is enabled by
     '-Wall'.

'-Waddress'
     Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses.  These include
     using the address of a function in a conditional expression, such
     as 'void func(void); if (func)', and comparisons against the memory
     address of a string literal, such as 'if (x == "abc")'.  Such uses
     typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
     always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
     indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
     call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
     behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that
     the programmer intended to use 'strcmp'.  This warning is enabled
     by '-Wall'.

'-Wlogical-op'
     Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
     This includes using logical operators in contexts where a bit-wise
     operator is likely to be expected.

'-Waggregate-return'
     Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined
     or called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also
     elicits a warning.)

'-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations'
     Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the compiler
     detects undefined behavior in some statement during one or more of
     the iterations.

'-Wno-attributes'
     Do not warn if an unexpected '__attribute__' is used, such as
     unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
     etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
     attributes.

'-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined'
     Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This
     suppresses warnings for redefinition of '__TIMESTAMP__',
     '__TIME__', '__DATE__', '__FILE__', and '__BASE_FILE__'.

'-Wstrict-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
     argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted
     without a warning if preceded by a declaration that specifies the
     argument types.)

'-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
     declaration.  For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like
     'static' are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
     is also enabled by '-Wextra'.

'-Wold-style-definition (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is
     given even if there is a previous prototype.

'-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only)'
     A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in
     K&R-style functions:

          void foo(bar) { }

     This warning is also enabled by '-Wextra'.

'-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
     declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
     provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
     that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
     This option is not valid for C++ because all function declarations
     provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration will declare an
     overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.  Use
     '-Wmissing-declarations' to detect missing declarations in C++.

'-Wmissing-declarations'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
     declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a
     prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that are not
     declared in header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for
     functions with previous non-prototype declarations; use
     '-Wmissing-prototype' to detect missing prototypes.  In C++, no
     warnings are issued for function templates, or for inline
     functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.

'-Wmissing-field-initializers'
     Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
     example, the following code causes such a warning, because 'x.h' is
     implicitly zero:

          struct s { int f, g, h; };
          struct s x = { 3, 4 };

     This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the
     following modification does not trigger a warning:

          struct s { int f, g, h; };
          struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

     This warning is included in '-Wextra'.  To get other '-Wextra'
     warnings without this one, use '-Wextra
     -Wno-missing-field-initializers'.

'-Wno-multichar'
     Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (''FOOF'') is used.
     Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
     implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable
     code.

'-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>'
     In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
     different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when
     characters outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can
     have two different character sequences that look the same.  To
     avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard sets out some
     "normalization rules" which when applied ensure that two sequences
     that look the same are turned into the same sequence.  GCC can warn
     you if you are using identifiers that have not been normalized;
     this option controls that warning.

     There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
     '-Wnormalized=nfc', which warns about any identifier that is not in
     the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, "NFC". NFC is the recommended
     form for most uses.

     Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
     ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in
     identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in
     portable ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
     '-Wnormalized=id' suppresses the warning for these characters.  It
     is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will
     correct this, which is why this option is not the default.

     You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
     '-Wnormalized=none'.  You should only do this if you are using some
     other normalization scheme (like "D"), because otherwise you can
     easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.

     Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look
     identical in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once
     formatting has been applied.  For instance '\u207F', "SUPERSCRIPT
     LATIN SMALL LETTER N", displays just like a regular 'n' that has
     been placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the "NFKC"
     normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
     well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
     '-Wnormalized=nfkc'.  This warning is comparable to warning about
     every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
     confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
     useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment
     cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

'-Wno-deprecated'
     Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.  *Note Deprecated
     Features::.

'-Wno-deprecated-declarations'
     Do not warn about uses of functions (*note Function Attributes::),
     variables (*note Variable Attributes::), and types (*note Type
     Attributes::) marked as deprecated by using the 'deprecated'
     attribute.

'-Wno-overflow'
     Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.

'-Wopenmp-simd'
     Warn if the vectorizer cost model overrides the OpenMP or the Cilk
     Plus simd directive set by user.  The '-fsimd-cost-model=unlimited'
     can be used to relax the cost model.

'-Woverride-init (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden
     when using designated initializers (*note Designated Initializers:
     Designated Inits.).

     This warning is included in '-Wextra'.  To get other '-Wextra'
     warnings without this one, use '-Wextra -Wno-override-init'.

'-Wpacked'
     Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
     attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
     Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
     instance, in this code, the variable 'f.x' in 'struct bar' is
     misaligned even though 'struct bar' does not itself have the packed
     attribute:

          struct foo {
            int x;
            char a, b, c, d;
          } __attribute__((packed));
          struct bar {
            char z;
            struct foo f;
          };

'-Wpacked-bitfield-compat'
     The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the 'packed' attribute on
     bit-fields of type 'char'.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but the
     change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
     informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
     For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field 'a'
     and 'b' in this structure:

          struct foo
          {
            char a:4;
            char b:8;
          } __attribute__ ((packed));

     This warning is enabled by default.  Use
     '-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat' to disable this warning.

'-Wpadded'
     Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an
     element of the structure or to align the whole structure.
     Sometimes when this happens it is possible to rearrange the fields
     of the structure to reduce the padding and so make the structure
     smaller.

'-Wredundant-decls'
     Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even
     in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.

'-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn if an 'extern' declaration is encountered within a function.

'-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor'
     Suppress warnings about use of C++11 inheriting constructors when
     the base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the
     warning is on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.

'-Winline'
     Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
     Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
     inline functions declared in system headers.

     The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or
     not to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into
     account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of
     inlining that has already been done in the current function.
     Therefore, seemingly insignificant changes in the source program
     can cause the warnings produced by '-Winline' to appear or
     disappear.

'-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and Objective-C++ only)'
     Suppress warnings from applying the 'offsetof' macro to a non-POD
     type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying 'offsetof'
     to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
     however, 'offsetof' typically gives meaningful results even when
     applied to certain kinds of non-POD types (such as a simple
     'struct' that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
     constructor).  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
     writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore
     the warning about it.

     The restrictions on 'offsetof' may be relaxed in a future version
     of the C++ standard.

'-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast'
     Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
     different size.  In C++, casting to a pointer type of smaller size
     is an error.  'Wint-to-pointer-cast' is enabled by default.

'-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)'
     Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
     different size.

'-Winvalid-pch'
     Warn if a precompiled header (*note Precompiled Headers::) is found
     in the search path but can't be used.

'-Wlong-long'
     Warn if 'long long' type is used.  This is enabled by either
     '-Wpedantic' or '-Wtraditional' in ISO C90 and C++98 modes.  To
     inhibit the warning messages, use '-Wno-long-long'.

'-Wvariadic-macros'
     Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic ISO C90 mode, or the
     GNU alternate syntax when in pedantic ISO C99 mode.  This is
     default.  To inhibit the warning messages, use
     '-Wno-variadic-macros'.

'-Wvarargs'
     Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable
     arguments like 'va_start'.  This is default.  To inhibit the
     warning messages, use '-Wno-varargs'.

'-Wvector-operation-performance'
     Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD capabilities
     of the architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
     Vector operation can be implemented 'piecewise', which means that
     the scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 'in
     parallel', which means that the vector operation is implemented
     using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance
     efficient; and 'as a single scalar', which means that vector fits
     into a scalar type.

'-Wno-virtual-move-assign'
     Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
     non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous
     because if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path,
     it will be moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up
     in the moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is
     written to avoid moving from a moved-from object, this warning can
     be disabled.

'-Wvla'
     Warn if variable length array is used in the code.  '-Wno-vla'
     prevents the '-Wpedantic' warning of the variable length array.

'-Wvolatile-register-var'
     Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
     modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate
     reads and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled
     by '-Wall'.

'-Wdisabled-optimization'
     Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning
     does not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your
     code; it merely indicates that GCC's optimizers are unable to
     handle the code effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code
     is too big or too complex; GCC refuses to optimize programs when
     the optimization itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of
     time.

'-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)'
     Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different
     signedness.  This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.
     It is implied by '-Wall' and by '-Wpedantic', which can be disabled
     with '-Wno-pointer-sign'.

'-Wstack-protector'
     This option is only active when '-fstack-protector' is active.  It
     warns about functions that are not protected against stack
     smashing.

'-Woverlength-strings'
     Warn about string constants that are longer than the "minimum
     maximum" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
     generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
     standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
     using longer strings.

     The limit applies _after_ string constant concatenation, and does
     not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters;
     in C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
     minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

     This option is implied by '-Wpedantic', and can be disabled with
     '-Wno-overlength-strings'.

'-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)'

     Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have a
     suffix.  When used together with '-Wsystem-headers' it warns about
     such constants in system header files.  This can be useful when
     preparing code to use with the 'FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64' pragma from
     the decimal floating-point extension to C99.

3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC
=============================================

GCC has various special options that are used for debugging either your
program or GCC:

'-g'
     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this
     debugging information.

     On most systems that use stabs format, '-g' enables use of extra
     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
     makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other
     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to
     control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
     '-gstabs+', '-gstabs', '-gxcoff+', '-gxcoff', or '-gvms' (see
     below).

     GCC allows you to use '-g' with '-O'.  The shortcuts taken by
     optimized code may occasionally produce surprising results: some
     variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may
     briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements may not
     be executed because they compute constant results or their values
     are already at hand; some statements may execute in different
     places because they have been moved out of loops.

     Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This
     makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might
     have bugs.

     The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
     capability for more than one debugging format.

'-gsplit-dwarf'
     Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a
     separate output file with the extension .dwo.  This option allows
     the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
     be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo
     files.

'-ggdb'
     Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use
     the most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native
     format if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions
     if at all possible.

'-gpubnames'
     Generate dwarf .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections.

'-ggnu-pubnames'
     Generate .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections in a format
     suitable for conversion into a GDB index.  This option is only
     useful with a linker that can produce GDB index version 7.

'-gstabs'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX
     on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems
     this option produces stabs debugging output that is not understood
     by DBX or SDB.  On System V Release 4 systems this option requires
     the GNU assembler.

'-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), for only symbols that are actually used.

'-femit-class-debug-always'
     Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only
     one object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This
     option should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle
     the way GCC normally emits debugging information for classes
     because using this option increases the size of debugging
     information by as much as a factor of two.

'-fdebug-types-section'
     When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
     their own '.debug_types' section instead of making them part of the
     '.debug_info' section.  It is more efficient to put them in a
     separate comdat sections since the linker can then remove
     duplicates.  But not all DWARF consumers support '.debug_types'
     sections yet and on some objects '.debug_types' produces larger
     instead of smaller debugging information.

'-gstabs+'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

'-gcoff'
     Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
     systems prior to System V Release 4.

'-gxcoff'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM
     RS/6000 systems.

'-gxcoff+'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program, and may cause
     assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS) to fail with an
     error.

'-gdwarf-VERSION'
     Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
     supported).  The value of VERSION may be either 2, 3 or 4; the
     default version for most targets is 4.

     Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always use
     some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.

     Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and '-fvar-tracking-assignments' for
     maximum benefit.

'-grecord-gcc-switches'
     This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
     compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
     DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.  The
     options are concatenated with spaces separating them from each
     other and from the compiler version.  See also
     '-frecord-gcc-switches' for another way of storing compiler options
     into the object file.  This is the default.

'-gno-record-gcc-switches'
     Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer
     attribute in DWARF debugging information.

'-gstrict-dwarf'
     Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
     selected with '-gdwarf-VERSION'.  On most targets using
     non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard versions is
     allowed.

'-gno-strict-dwarf'
     Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
     selected with '-gdwarf-VERSION'.

'-gvms'
     Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems.

'-gLEVEL'
'-ggdbLEVEL'
'-gstabsLEVEL'
'-gcoffLEVEL'
'-gxcoffLEVEL'
'-gvmsLEVEL'
     Request debugging information and also use LEVEL to specify how
     much information.  The default level is 2.

     Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, '-g0' negates
     '-g'.

     Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces
     in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This
     includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and line
     number tables, but no information about local variables.

     Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro
     definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro
     expansion when you use '-g3'.

     '-gdwarf-2' does not accept a concatenated debug level, because GCC
     used to support an option '-gdwarf' that meant to generate debug
     information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
     different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.
     That debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be
     changed now.  Instead use an additional '-gLEVEL' option to change
     the debug level for DWARF.

'-gtoggle'
     Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
     generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of
     this argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect
     after all other options are processed, and it does so only once, no
     matter how many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be
     used with '-fcompare-debug'.

'-fsanitize=address'
     Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.  Memory
     access instructions will be instrumented to detect out-of-bounds
     and use-after-free bugs.  See
     <http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/> for more details.
     The run-time behavior can be influenced using the 'ASAN_OPTIONS'
     environment variable; see
     <https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/Flags#Run-time_flags>
     for a list of supported options.

'-fsanitize=kernel-address'
     Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel.  See
     <http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizerForKernel>
     for more details.

'-fsanitize=thread'
     Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector.  Memory access
     instructions will be instrumented to detect data race bugs.  See
     <http://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer/> for more details.  The
     run-time behavior can be influenced using the 'TSAN_OPTIONS'
     environment variable; see
     <https://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer/wiki/Flags> for a list
     of supported options.

'-fsanitize=leak'
     Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.  This option only
     matters for linking of executables and if neither
     '-fsanitize=address' nor '-fsanitize=thread' is used.  In that case
     it will link the executable against a library that overrides
     'malloc' and other allocator functions.  See
     <https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/LeakSanitizer>
     for more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using
     the 'LSAN_OPTIONS' environment variable.

'-fsanitize=undefined'
     Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior
     detector.  Various computations will be instrumented to detect
     undefined behavior at runtime.  Current suboptions are:

     '-fsanitize=shift'

          This option enables checking that the result of a shift
          operation is not undefined.  Note that what exactly is
          considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as
          well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc.

     '-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero'

          Detect integer division by zero as well as 'INT_MIN / -1'
          division.

     '-fsanitize=unreachable'

          With this option, the compiler will turn the
          '__builtin_unreachable' call into a diagnostics message call
          instead.  When reaching the '__builtin_unreachable' call, the
          behavior is undefined.

     '-fsanitize=vla-bound'

          This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a
          variable length array is positive.  This option does not have
          any effect in '-std=c++1y' mode, as the standard requires the
          exception be thrown instead.

     '-fsanitize=null'

          This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the
          application built with this option turned on will issue an
          error message when it tries to dereference a NULL pointer, or
          if a reference (possibly an rvalue reference) is bound to a
          NULL pointer.

     '-fsanitize=return'

          This option enables return statement checking.  Programs built
          with this option turned on will issue an error message when
          the end of a non-void function is reached without actually
          returning a value.  This option works in C++ only.

     '-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow'

          This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We
          check that the result of '+', '*', and both unary and binary
          '-' does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.  Note,
          integer promotion rules must be taken into account.  That is,
          the following is not an overflow:
               signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
               a++;

     While '-ftrapv' causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
     '-fsanitize=undefined' gives a diagnostic message.  This currently
     works only for the C family of languages.

'-fdump-final-insns[=FILE]'
     Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to FILE.  If the
     optional argument is omitted (or if FILE is '.'), the name of the
     dump file is determined by appending '.gkd' to the compilation
     output file name.

'-fcompare-debug[=OPTS]'
     If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second
     time, adding OPTS and '-fcompare-debug-second' to the arguments
     passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
     representation in both compilations, and print an error if they
     differ.

     If the equal sign is omitted, the default '-gtoggle' is used.

     The environment variable 'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG', if defined, non-empty
     and nonzero, implicitly enables '-fcompare-debug'.  If
     'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' is defined to a string starting with a dash,
     then it is used for OPTS, otherwise the default '-gtoggle' is used.

     '-fcompare-debug=', with the equal sign but without OPTS, is
     equivalent to '-fno-compare-debug', which disables the dumping of
     the final representation and the second compilation, preventing
     even 'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' from taking effect.

     To verify full coverage during '-fcompare-debug' testing, set
     'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' to say '-fcompare-debug-not-overridden', which
     GCC rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation (rather
     than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a warning,
     setting 'GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG' to '-w%n-fcompare-debug not overridden'
     will do.

'-fcompare-debug-second'
     This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
     compilation requested by '-fcompare-debug', along with options to
     silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
     side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.
     Dump files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to
     contain the '.gk' additional extension during the second
     compilation, to avoid overwriting those generated by the first.

     When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
     _first_ compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
     other than debugging the compiler proper.

'-feliminate-dwarf2-dups'
     Compress DWARF 2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
     information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
     generating DWARF 2 debugging information with '-gdwarf-2'.

'-femit-struct-debug-baseonly'
     Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base
     name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file
     in which the struct is defined.

     This option substantially reduces the size of debugging
     information, but at significant potential loss in type information
     to the debugger.  See '-femit-struct-debug-reduced' for a less
     aggressive option.  See '-femit-struct-debug-detailed' for more
     detailed control.

     This option works only with DWARF 2.

'-femit-struct-debug-reduced'
     Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the base
     name of the compilation source file matches the base name of file
     in which the type is defined, unless the struct is a template or
     defined in a system header.

     This option significantly reduces the size of debugging
     information, with some potential loss in type information to the
     debugger.  See '-femit-struct-debug-baseonly' for a more aggressive
     option.  See '-femit-struct-debug-detailed' for more detailed
     control.

     This option works only with DWARF 2.

'-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=SPEC-LIST]'
     Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler generates
     debug information.  The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug
     information between different object files within the same program.

     This option is a detailed version of '-femit-struct-debug-reduced'
     and '-femit-struct-debug-baseonly', which serves for most needs.

     A specification has the syntax
     ['dir:'|'ind:']['ord:'|'gen:']('any'|'sys'|'base'|'none')

     The optional first word limits the specification to structs that
     are used directly ('dir:') or used indirectly ('ind:').  A struct
     type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
     Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.  That is, when use
     of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.  An example
     is 'struct one direct; struct two * indirect;'.

     The optional second word limits the specification to ordinary
     structs ('ord:') or generic structs ('gen:').  Generic structs are
     a bit complicated to explain.  For C++, these are non-explicit
     specializations of template classes, or non-template classes within
     the above.  Other programming languages have generics, but
     '-femit-struct-debug-detailed' does not yet implement them.

     The third word specifies the source files for those structs for
     which the compiler should emit debug information.  The values
     'none' and 'any' have the normal meaning.  The value 'base' means
     that the base of name of the file in which the type declaration
     appears must match the base of the name of the main compilation
     file.  In practice, this means that when compiling 'foo.c', debug
     information is generated for types declared in that file and
     'foo.h', but not other header files.  The value 'sys' means those
     types satisfying 'base' or declared in system or compiler headers.

     You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your
     application.

     The default is '-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all'.

     This option works only with DWARF 2.

'-fno-merge-debug-strings'
     Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
     information that are identical in different object files.  Merging
     is not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases
     the size of the debug information in the output file at the cost of
     increasing link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.

'-fdebug-prefix-map=OLD=NEW'
     When compiling files in directory 'OLD', record debugging
     information describing them as in 'NEW' instead.

'-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm'
     Emit DWARF 2 unwind info as compiler generated '.eh_frame' section
     instead of using GAS '.cfi_*' directives.

'-p'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program 'prof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

'-pg'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program 'gprof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

'-Q'
     Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled,
     and print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

'-ftime-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by
     each pass when it finishes.

'-fmem-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
     allocation when it finishes.

'-fmem-report-wpa'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
     allocation for the WPA phase only.

'-fpre-ipa-mem-report'
'-fpost-ipa-mem-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
     allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.

'-fprofile-report'
     Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency of the
     (estimated) profile and effect of individual passes.

'-fstack-usage'
     Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program,
     on a per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by
     appending '.su' to the AUXNAME.  AUXNAME is generated from the name
     of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an
     executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An
     entry is made up of three fields:

        * The name of the function.
        * A number of bytes.
        * One or more qualifiers: 'static', 'dynamic', 'bounded'.

     The qualifier 'static' means that the function manipulates the
     stack statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the
     frame on function entry and released on function exit; no stack
     adjustments are otherwise made in the function.  The second field
     is this fixed number of bytes.

     The qualifier 'dynamic' means that the function manipulates the
     stack dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described
     above, stack adjustments are made in the body of the function, for
     example to push/pop arguments around function calls.  If the
     qualifier 'bounded' is also present, the amount of these
     adjustments is bounded at compile time and the second field is an
     upper bound of the total amount of stack used by the function.  If
     it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is not bounded
     at compile time and the second field only represents the bounded
     part.

'-fprofile-arcs'
     Add code so that program flow "arcs" are instrumented.  During
     execution the program records how many times each branch and call
     is executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the
     compiled program exits it saves this data to a file called
     'AUXNAME.gcda' for each source file.  The data may be used for
     profile-directed optimizations ('-fbranch-probabilities'), or for
     test coverage analysis ('-ftest-coverage').  Each object file's
     AUXNAME is generated from the name of the output file, if
     explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise
     it is the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is
     removed (e.g. 'foo.gcda' for input file 'dir/foo.c', or
     'dir/foo.gcda' for output file specified as '-o dir/foo.o').  *Note
     Cross-profiling::.

'--coverage'

     This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for
     coverage analysis.  The option is a synonym for '-fprofile-arcs'
     '-ftest-coverage' (when compiling) and '-lgcov' (when linking).
     See the documentation for those options for more details.

        * Compile the source files with '-fprofile-arcs' plus
          optimization and code generation options.  For test coverage
          analysis, use the additional '-ftest-coverage' option.  You do
          not need to profile every source file in a program.

        * Link your object files with '-lgcov' or '-fprofile-arcs' (the
          latter implies the former).

        * Run the program on a representative workload to generate the
          arc profile information.  This may be repeated any number of
          times.  You can run concurrent instances of your program, and
          provided that the file system supports locking, the data files
          will be correctly updated.  Also 'fork' calls are detected and
          correctly handled (double counting will not happen).

        * For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files
          again with the same optimization and code generation options
          plus '-fbranch-probabilities' (*note Options that Control
          Optimization: Optimize Options.).

        * For test coverage analysis, use 'gcov' to produce human
          readable information from the '.gcno' and '.gcda' files.
          Refer to the 'gcov' documentation for further information.

     With '-fprofile-arcs', for each function of your program GCC
     creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the
     graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be
     instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the number of times
     that these arcs are executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only
     entrance to a block, the instrumentation code can be added to the
     block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to hold the
     instrumentation code.

'-ftest-coverage'
     Produce a notes file that the 'gcov' code-coverage utility (*note
     'gcov'--a Test Coverage Program: Gcov.) can use to show program
     coverage.  Each source file's note file is called 'AUXNAME.gcno'.
     Refer to the '-fprofile-arcs' option above for a description of
     AUXNAME and instructions on how to generate test coverage data.
     Coverage data matches the source files more closely if you do not
     optimize.

'-fdbg-cnt-list'
     Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.

'-fdbg-cnt=COUNTER-VALUE-LIST'
     Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  COUNTER-VALUE-LIST is
     a comma-separated list of NAME:VALUE pairs which sets the upper
     bound of each debug counter NAME to VALUE.  All debug counters have
     the initial upper bound of 'UINT_MAX'; thus 'dbg_cnt()' returns
     true always unless the upper bound is set by this option.  For
     example, with '-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0', 'dbg_cnt(dce)'
     returns true only for first 10 invocations.

'-fenable-KIND-PASS'
'-fdisable-KIND-PASS=RANGE-LIST'

     This is a set of options that are used to explicitly disable/enable
     optimization passes.  These options are intended for use for
     debugging GCC. Compiler users should use regular options for
     enabling/disabling passes instead.

     '-fdisable-ipa-PASS'
          Disable IPA pass PASS.  PASS is the pass name.  If the same
          pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the
          pass name should be appended with a sequential number starting
          from 1.

     '-fdisable-rtl-PASS'
     '-fdisable-rtl-PASS=RANGE-LIST'
          Disable RTL pass PASS.  PASS is the pass name.  If the same
          pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the
          pass name should be appended with a sequential number starting
          from 1.  RANGE-LIST is a comma-separated list of function
          ranges or assembler names.  Each range is a number pair
          separated by a colon.  The range is inclusive in both ends.
          If the range is trivial, the number pair can be simplified as
          a single number.  If the function's call graph node's UID
          falls within one of the specified ranges, the PASS is disabled
          for that function.  The UID is shown in the function header of
          a dump file, and the pass names can be dumped by using option
          '-fdump-passes'.

     '-fdisable-tree-PASS'
     '-fdisable-tree-PASS=RANGE-LIST'
          Disable tree pass PASS.  See '-fdisable-rtl' for the
          description of option arguments.

     '-fenable-ipa-PASS'
          Enable IPA pass PASS.  PASS is the pass name.  If the same
          pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the
          pass name should be appended with a sequential number starting
          from 1.

     '-fenable-rtl-PASS'
     '-fenable-rtl-PASS=RANGE-LIST'
          Enable RTL pass PASS.  See '-fdisable-rtl' for option argument
          description and examples.

     '-fenable-tree-PASS'
     '-fenable-tree-PASS=RANGE-LIST'
          Enable tree pass PASS.  See '-fdisable-rtl' for the
          description of option arguments.

     Here are some examples showing uses of these options.


          # disable ccp1 for all functions
             -fdisable-tree-ccp1
          # disable complete unroll for function whose cgraph node uid is 1
             -fenable-tree-cunroll=1
          # disable gcse2 for functions at the following ranges [1,1],
          # [300,400], and [400,1000]
          # disable gcse2 for functions foo and foo2
             -fdisable-rtl-gcse2=foo,foo2
          # disable early inlining
             -fdisable-tree-einline
          # disable ipa inlining
             -fdisable-ipa-inline
          # enable tree full unroll
             -fenable-tree-unroll


'-dLETTERS'
'-fdump-rtl-PASS'
'-fdump-rtl-PASS=FILENAME'
     Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified
     by LETTERS.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
     compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by
     appending a pass number and a word to the DUMPNAME, and the files
     are created in the directory of the output file.  In case of
     '=FILENAME' option, the dump is output on the given file instead of
     the pass numbered dump files.  Note that the pass number is
     computed statically as passes get registered into the pass manager.
     Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of execution
     of passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin could have
     a number over 200 even if it executed quite early.  DUMPNAME is
     generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified
     and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the
     source file.  These switches may have different effects when '-E'
     is used for preprocessing.

     Debug dumps can be enabled with a '-fdump-rtl' switch or some '-d'
     option LETTERS.  Here are the possible letters for use in PASS and

     '-fdump-rtl-split5'
          '-fdump-rtl-split1', '-fdump-rtl-split2', '-fdump-rtl-split3',
          '-fdump-rtl-split4' and '-fdump-rtl-split5' enable dumping
          after five rounds of instruction splitting.

          Usually used with '-fdump-rtl-expand'.

'-fdump-noaddr'
     When doing debugging dumps, suppress address output.  This makes it
     more feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler
     invocations with different compiler binaries and/or different text
     / bss / data / heap / stack / dso start locations.

'-fdump-unnumbered'
     When doing debugging dumps, suppress instruction numbers and

     debugging dumps for compiler invocations with different options, in
     particular with and without '-g'.

'-fdump-unnumbered-links'
     When doing debugging dumps (see '-d' option above), suppress
     instruction numbers for the links to the previous and next
     instructions in a sequence.

'-fdump-translation-unit (C++ only)'
'-fdump-translation-unit-OPTIONS (C++ only)'
     Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire
     translation unit to a file.  The file name is made by appending
     '.tu' to the source file name, and the file is created in the same
     directory as the output file.  If the '-OPTIONS' form is used,
     OPTIONS controls the details of the dump as described for the
     '-fdump-tree' options.

'-fdump-class-hierarchy (C++ only)'
'-fdump-class-hierarchy-OPTIONS (C++ only)'
     Dump a representation of each class's hierarchy and virtual
     function table layout to a file.  The file name is made by
     appending '.class' to the source file name, and the file is created
     in the same directory as the output file.  If the '-OPTIONS' form
     is used, OPTIONS controls the details of the dump as described for
     the '-fdump-tree' options.

'-fdump-ipa-SWITCH'
     Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural analysis
     language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a
     switch specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is
     created in the same directory as the output file.  The following
     dumps are possible:

     'all'
          Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.

     'cgraph'
          Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused
          function removal, and inlining decisions.

     'inline'
          Dump after function inlining.

'-fdump-passes'
     Dump the list of optimization passes that are turned on and off by
     the current command-line options.

'-fdump-statistics-OPTION'
     Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate file.
     The file name is generated by appending a suffix ending in
     '.statistics' to the source file name, and the file is created in
     the same directory as the output file.  If the '-OPTION' form is
     used, '-stats' causes counters to be summed over the whole
     compilation unit while '-details' dumps every event as the passes
     generate them.  The default with no option is to sum counters for
     each function compiled.

'-fdump-tree-SWITCH'
'-fdump-tree-SWITCH-OPTIONS'
'-fdump-tree-SWITCH-OPTIONS=FILENAME'
     Control the dumping at various stages of processing the
     intermediate language tree to a file.  The file name is generated
     by appending a switch-specific suffix to the source file name, and
     the file is created in the same directory as the output file.  In
     case of '=FILENAME' option, the dump is output on the given file
     instead of the auto named dump files.  If the '-OPTIONS' form is
     used, OPTIONS is a list of '-' separated options which control the
     details of the dump.  Not all options are applicable to all dumps;
     those that are not meaningful are ignored.  The following options
     are available

     'address'
          Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not
          meaningful as it changes according to the environment and
          source file.  Its primary use is for tying up a dump file with
          a debug environment.
     'asmname'
          If 'DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME' has been set for a given decl, use
          that in the dump instead of 'DECL_NAME'.  Its primary use is
          ease of use working backward from mangled names in the
          assembly file.
     'slim'
          When dumping front-end intermediate representations, inhibit
          dumping of members of a scope or body of a function merely
          because that scope has been reached.  Only dump such items
          when they are directly reachable by some other path.

          When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits
          dumping the bodies of control structures.

          When dumping RTL, print the RTL in slim (condensed) form
          instead of the default LISP-like representation.
     'raw'
          Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default, trees are
          pretty-printed into a C-like representation.
     'details'
          Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option).
          Also include information from the optimization passes.
     'stats'
          Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored
          by every dump option).
     'blocks'
          Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).
     'graph'
          For each of the other indicated dump files
          ('-fdump-rtl-PASS'), dump a representation of the control flow
          graph suitable for viewing with GraphViz to
          'FILE.PASSID.PASS.dot'.  Each function in the file is
          pretty-printed as a subgraph, so that GraphViz can render them
          all in a single plot.

          This option currently only works for RTL dumps, and the RTL is
          always dumped in slim form.
     'vops'
          Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.
     'lineno'
          Enable showing line numbers for statements.
     'uid'
          Enable showing the unique ID ('DECL_UID') for each variable.
     'verbose'
          Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.
     'eh'
          Enable showing the EH region number holding each statement.
     'scev'
          Enable showing scalar evolution analysis details.
     'optimized'
          Enable showing optimization information (only available in
          certain passes).
     'missed'
          Enable showing missed optimization information (only available
          in certain passes).
     'notes'
          Enable other detailed optimization information (only available
          in certain passes).
     '=FILENAME'
          Instead of an auto named dump file, output into the given file
          name.  The file names 'stdout' and 'stderr' are treated
          specially and are considered already open standard streams.
          For example,

               gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fdump-tree-vect-blocks=foo.dump
                    -fdump-tree-pre=stderr file.c

          outputs vectorizer dump into 'foo.dump', while the PRE dump is
          output on to 'stderr'.  If two conflicting dump filenames are
          given for the same pass, then the latter option overrides the
          earlier one.

     'all'
          Turn on all options, except 'raw', 'slim', 'verbose' and
          'lineno'.

     'optall'
          Turn on all optimization options, i.e., 'optimized', 'missed',
          and 'note'.

     The following tree dumps are possible:

     'original'
          Dump before any tree based optimization, to 'FILE.original'.

     'optimized'
          Dump after all tree based optimization, to 'FILE.optimized'.

     'gimple'
          Dump each function before and after the gimplification pass to
          a file.  The file name is made by appending '.gimple' to the
          source file name.

'-fopt-info'
'-fopt-info-OPTIONS'
'-fopt-info-OPTIONS=FILENAME'
     Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes.  If
     the '-OPTIONS' form is used, OPTIONS is a list of '-' separated
     options to select the dump details and optimizations.  If OPTIONS
     is not specified, it defaults to 'optimized' for details and
     'optall' for optimization groups.  If the FILENAME is not
     specified, it defaults to 'stderr'.  Note that the output FILENAME
     will be overwritten in case of multiple translation units.  If a
     combined output from multiple translation units is desired,
     'stderr' should be used instead.

     The options can be divided into two groups, 1) options describing
     the verbosity of the dump, and 2) options describing which
     optimizations should be included.  The options from both the groups
     can be freely mixed as they are non-overlapping.  However, in case
     of any conflicts, the latter options override the earlier options
     on the command line.  Though multiple -fopt-info options are
     accepted, only one of them can have '=filename'.  If other
     filenames are provided then all but the first one are ignored.

     The dump verbosity has the following options

     'optimized'
          Print information when an optimization is successfully
          applied.  It is up to a pass to decide which information is
          relevant.  For example, the vectorizer passes print the source
          location of loops which got successfully vectorized.
     'missed'
          Print information about missed optimizations.  Individual
          passes control which information to include in the output.
          For example,

               gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed

          will print information about missed optimization opportunities
          from vectorization passes on stderr.
     'note'
          Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
          transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.
     'all'
          Print detailed optimization information.  This includes
          OPTIMIZED, MISSED, and NOTE.

     The second set of options describes a group of optimizations and
     may include one or more of the following.

     'ipa'
          Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.
     'loop'
          Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.
     'inline'
          Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.
     'vec'
          Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.
     'optall'
          Enable dumps from all optimizations.  This is a superset of
          the optimization groups listed above.

     For example,
          gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all

     outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
     'missed.all'.

     As another example,
          gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt

     will output information about missed optimizations as well as
     optimized locations from all the inlining passes into 'inline.txt'.

     If the FILENAME is provided, then the dumps from all the applicable
     optimizations are concatenated into the 'filename'.  Otherwise the
     dump is output onto 'stderr'.  If OPTIONS is omitted, it defaults
     to 'all-optall', which means dump all available optimization info
     from all the passes.  In the following example, all optimization
     info is output on to 'stderr'.

          gcc -O3 -fopt-info

     Note that '-fopt-info-vec-missed' behaves the same as
     '-fopt-info-missed-vec'.

     As another example, consider

          gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt

     Here the two output filenames 'vec.miss' and 'loop.opt' are in
     conflict since only one output file is allowed.  In this case, only
     the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
     ignored.  Thus only the 'vec.miss' is produced which contains dumps
     from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

'-frandom-seed=STRING'
     This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of random
     numbers in generating certain symbol names that have to be
     different in every compiled file.  It is also used to place unique
     stamps in coverage data files and the object files that produce
     them.  You can use the '-frandom-seed' option to produce
     reproducibly identical object files.

     The STRING should be different for every file you compile.

'-fsched-verbose=N'
     On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls
     the amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This
     information is written to standard error, unless
     '-fdump-rtl-sched1' or '-fdump-rtl-sched2' is specified, in which
     case it is output to the usual dump listing file, '.sched1' or
     '.sched2' respectively.  However for N greater than nine, the
     output is always printed to standard error.

     For N greater than zero, '-fsched-verbose' outputs the same
     information as '-fdump-rtl-sched1' and '-fdump-rtl-sched2'.  For N
     greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
     detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For N greater
     than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions
     info.  And for N over four, '-fsched-verbose' also includes
     dependence info.

'-save-temps'
'-save-temps=cwd'
     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place
     them in the current directory and name them based on the source
     file.  Thus, compiling 'foo.c' with '-c -save-temps' produces files
     'foo.i' and 'foo.s', as well as 'foo.o'.  This creates a
     preprocessed 'foo.i' output file even though the compiler now
     normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

     When used in combination with the '-x' command-line option,
     '-save-temps' is sensible enough to avoid over writing an input
     source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.  The
     corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
     source file before using '-save-temps'.

     If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
     files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or
     the same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it
     is likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with
     each other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:

          gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
          gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&

     may result in 'foo.i' and 'foo.o' being written to simultaneously
     by both compilers.

'-save-temps=obj'
     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently.  If the
     '-o' option is used, the temporary files are based on the object
     file.  If the '-o' option is not used, the '-save-temps=obj' switch
     behaves like '-save-temps'.

     For example:

          gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
          gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
          gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar

     creates 'foo.i', 'foo.s', 'dir/xbar.i', 'dir/xbar.s',
     'dir2/yfoobar.i', 'dir2/yfoobar.s', and 'dir2/yfoobar.o'.

'-time[=FILE]'
     Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
     sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and
     assembler (plus the linker if linking is done).

     Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like
     this:

          # cc1 0.12 0.01
          # as 0.00 0.01

     The first number on each line is the "user time", that is time
     spent executing the program itself.  The second number is "system
     time", time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of
     the program.  Both numbers are in seconds.

     With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to
     the named file, and it looks like this:

          0.12 0.01 cc1 OPTIONS
          0.00 0.01 as OPTIONS

     The "user time" and the "system time" are moved before the program
     name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that
     one can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which
     options.

'-fvar-tracking'
     Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored
     at each position in code.  Better debugging information is then
     generated (if the debugging information format supports this
     information).

     It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization ('-Os',
     '-O', '-O2', ...), debugging information ('-g') and the debug info
     format supports it.

'-fvar-tracking-assignments'
     Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
     attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation
     all the way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information
     while optimizing.  Use of '-gdwarf-4' is recommended along with it.

     It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
     annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end.

'-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle'
     Toggle '-fvar-tracking-assignments', in the same way that
     '-gtoggle' toggles '-g'.

'-print-file-name=LIBRARY'
     Print the full absolute name of the library file LIBRARY that would
     be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
     option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
     file name.

'-print-multi-directory'
     Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by
     any other switches present in the command line.  This directory is
     supposed to exist in 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.

'-print-multi-lib'
     Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler
     switches that enable them.  The directory name is separated from
     the switches by ';', and each switch starts with an '@' instead of
     the '-', without spaces between multiple switches.  This is
     supposed to ease shell processing.

'-print-multi-os-directory'
     Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib, relative
     to some 'lib' subdirectory.  If OS libraries are present in the
     'lib' subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is usually just
     '.', if OS libraries are present in 'libSUFFIX' sibling directories
     this prints e.g. '../lib64', '../lib' or '../lib32', or if OS
     libraries are present in 'lib/SUBDIR' subdirectories it prints e.g.
     'amd64', 'sparcv9' or 'ev6'.

'-print-multiarch'
     Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch, relative
     to some 'lib' subdirectory.

'-print-prog-name=PROGRAM'
     Like '-print-file-name', but searches for a program such as 'cpp'.

'-print-libgcc-file-name'
     Same as '-print-file-name=libgcc.a'.

     This is useful when you use '-nostdlib' or '-nodefaultlibs' but you
     do want to link with 'libgcc.a'.  You can do:

          gcc -nostdlib FILES... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

'-print-search-dirs'
     Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list
     of program and library directories 'gcc' searches--and don't do
     anything else.

     This is useful when 'gcc' prints the error message 'installation
     problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory'.  To resolve
     this you either need to put 'cpp0' and the other compiler
     components where 'gcc' expects to find them, or you can set the
     environment variable 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' to the directory where you
     installed them.  Don't forget the trailing '/'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.

'-print-sysroot'
     Print the target sysroot directory that is used during compilation.
     This is the target sysroot specified either at configure time or
     using the '--sysroot' option, possibly with an extra suffix that
     depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is specified,
     the option prints nothing.

'-print-sysroot-headers-suffix'
     Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
     headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with
     such a suffix--and don't do anything else.

'-dumpmachine'
     Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
     'i686-pc-linux-gnu')--and don't do anything else.

'-dumpversion'
     Print the compiler version (for example, '3.0')--and don't do
     anything else.

'-dumpspecs'
     Print the compiler's built-in specs--and don't do anything else.
     (This is used when GCC itself is being built.)  *Note Spec Files::.

'-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types'
     Normally, when producing DWARF 2 output, GCC avoids producing debug
     symbol output for types that are nowhere used in the source file
     being compiled.  Sometimes it is useful to have GCC emit debugging
     information for all types declared in a compilation unit,
     regardless of whether or not they are actually used in that
     compilation unit, for example if, in the debugger, you want to cast
     a value to a type that is not actually used in your program (but is
     declared).  More often, however, this results in a significant
     amount of wasted space.

3.10 Options That Control Optimization
======================================

These options control various sorts of optimizations.

 Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
get exactly the results you expect from the source code.

 Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve the
performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time and
possibly the ability to debug the program.

 The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode
allows the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when
compiling each of them.

 Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

 Most optimizations are only enabled if an '-O' level is set on the
command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.

 Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly
different set of optimizations may be enabled at each '-O' level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with '-Q --help=optimizers' to
find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
*Note Overall Options::, for examples.

'-O'
'-O1'
     Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a
     lot more memory for a large function.

     With '-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
     time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal
     of compilation time.

     '-O' turns on the following optimization flags:
          -fauto-inc-dec
          -fcompare-elim
          -fcprop-registers
          -fdce
          -fdefer-pop
          -fdelayed-branch
          -fdse
          -fguess-branch-probability
          -fif-conversion2
          -fif-conversion
          -fipa-pure-const
          -fipa-profile
          -fipa-reference
          -fmerge-constants
          -fsplit-wide-types
          -ftree-bit-ccp
          -ftree-builtin-call-dce
          -ftree-ccp
          -ftree-ch
          -ftree-copyrename
          -ftree-dce
          -ftree-dominator-opts
          -ftree-dse
          -ftree-forwprop
          -ftree-fre
          -ftree-phiprop
          -ftree-slsr
          -ftree-sra
          -ftree-pta
          -ftree-ter
          -funit-at-a-time

     '-O' also turns on '-fomit-frame-pointer' on machines where doing
     so does not interfere with debugging.

'-O2'
     Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported
     optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  As
     compared to '-O', this option increases both compilation time and
     the performance of the generated code.

     '-O2' turns on all optimization flags specified by '-O'.  It also
     turns on the following optimization flags:
          -fthread-jumps
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps
          -falign-loops  -falign-labels
          -fcaller-saves
          -fcrossjumping
          -fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks
          -fdelete-null-pointer-checks
          -fdevirtualize -fdevirtualize-speculatively
          -fexpensive-optimizations
          -fgcse  -fgcse-lm
          -fhoist-adjacent-loads
          -finline-small-functions
          -findirect-inlining
          -fipa-sra
          -fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference
          -foptimize-sibling-calls
          -fpartial-inlining
          -fpeephole2
          -freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions
          -frerun-cse-after-loop
          -fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec
          -fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2
          -fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow
          -ftree-switch-conversion -ftree-tail-merge
          -ftree-pre
          -ftree-vrp

     Please note the warning under '-fgcse' about invoking '-O2' on
     programs that use computed gotos.

'-O3'
     Optimize yet more.  '-O3' turns on all optimizations specified by
     '-O2' and also turns on the '-finline-functions',
     '-funswitch-loops', '-fpredictive-commoning',
     '-fgcse-after-reload', '-ftree-loop-vectorize',
     '-ftree-slp-vectorize', '-fvect-cost-model', '-ftree-partial-pre'
     and '-fipa-cp-clone' options.

'-O0'
     Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
     results.  This is the default.

'-Os'
     Optimize for size.  '-Os' enables all '-O2' optimizations that do
     not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
     optimizations designed to reduce code size.

     '-Os' disables the following optimization flags:
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops
          -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition
          -fprefetch-loop-arrays

'-Ofast'
     Disregard strict standards compliance.  '-Ofast' enables all '-O3'
     optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not valid
     for all standard-compliant programs.  It turns on '-ffast-math' and
     the Fortran-specific '-fno-protect-parens' and '-fstack-arrays'.

'-Og'
     Optimize debugging experience.  '-Og' enables optimizations that do
     not interfere with debugging.  It should be the optimization level
     of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering a
     reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
     and a good debugging experience.

     If you use multiple '-O' options, with or without level numbers,
     the last such option is the one that is effective.

 Options of the form '-fFLAG' specify machine-independent flags.  Most
flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
'-ffoo' is '-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms is
listed--the one you typically use.  You can figure out the other form by
either removing 'no-' or adding it.

 The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by '-O' options or are related to ones that are.  You can use
the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning" of
optimizations to be performed is desired.

'-fno-defer-pop'
     Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that
     function returns.  For machines that must pop arguments after a
     function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on
     the stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.

     Disabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fforward-propagate'
     Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to
     combine two instructions and checks if the result can be
     simplified.  If loop unrolling is active, two passes are performed
     and the second is scheduled after loop unrolling.

     This option is enabled by default at optimization levels '-O',
     '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-ffp-contract=STYLE'
     '-ffp-contract=off' disables floating-point expression contraction.
     '-ffp-contract=fast' enables floating-point expression contraction
     such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
     native support for them.  '-ffp-contract=on' enables floating-point
     expression contraction if allowed by the language standard.  This
     is currently not implemented and treated equal to
     '-ffp-contract=off'.

     The default is '-ffp-contract=fast'.

'-fomit-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that don't
     need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore
     frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available in many
     functions.  *It also makes debugging impossible on some machines.*

     On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
     the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame
     pointer and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
     machine-description macro 'FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' controls whether
     a target machine supports this flag.  *Note Register Usage:
     (gccint)Registers.

     Starting with GCC version 4.6, the default setting (when not
     optimizing for size) for 32-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86
     targets has been changed to '-fomit-frame-pointer'.  The default
     can be reverted to '-fno-omit-frame-pointer' by configuring GCC
     with the '--enable-frame-pointer' configure option.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-foptimize-sibling-calls'
     Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fno-inline'
     Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with the
     'always_inline' attribute.  This is the default when not
     optimizing.

     Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them with
     the 'noinline' attribute.

'-finline-small-functions'
     Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller
     than expected function call code (so overall size of program gets
     smaller).  The compiler heuristically decides which functions are
     simple enough to be worth integrating in this way.  This inlining
     applies to all functions, even those not declared inline.

     Enabled at level '-O2'.

'-findirect-inlining'
     Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at
     compile time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any
     effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the
     '-finline-functions' or '-finline-small-functions' options.

     Enabled at level '-O2'.

'-finline-functions'
     Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared
     inline.  The compiler heuristically decides which functions are
     worth integrating in this way.

     If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
     is declared 'static', then the function is normally not output as
     assembler code in its own right.

     Enabled at level '-O3'.

'-finline-functions-called-once'
     Consider all 'static' functions called once for inlining into their
     caller even if they are not marked 'inline'.  If a call to a given
     function is integrated, then the function is not output as
     assembler code in its own right.

     Enabled at levels '-O1', '-O2', '-O3' and '-Os'.

'-fearly-inlining'
     Inline functions marked by 'always_inline' and functions whose body
     seems smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
     '-fprofile-generate' instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing
     so makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining
     faster on programs having large chains of nested wrapper functions.

     Enabled by default.

'-fipa-sra'
     Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal
     of unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by
     reference by parameters passed by value.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3' and '-Os'.

'-finline-limit=N'
     By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.
     This flag allows coarse control of this limit.  N is the size of
     functions that can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.

     Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which
     may be specified individually by using '--param NAME=VALUE'.  The
     '-finline-limit=N' option sets some of these parameters as follows:

     'max-inline-insns-single'
          is set to N/2.
     'max-inline-insns-auto'
          is set to N/2.

     See below for a documentation of the individual parameters
     controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.

     _Note:_ there may be no value to '-finline-limit' that results in
     default behavior.

     _Note:_ pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context,
     an abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way does it
     represent a count of assembly instructions and as such its exact
     meaning might change from one release to an another.

'-fno-keep-inline-dllexport'
     This is a more fine-grained version of '-fkeep-inline-functions',
     which applies only to functions that are declared using the
     'dllexport' attribute or declspec (*Note Declaring Attributes of
     Functions: Function Attributes.)

'-fkeep-inline-functions'
     In C, emit 'static' functions that are declared 'inline' into the
     object file, even if the function has been inlined into all of its
     callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the 'extern
     inline' extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all inline
     functions into the object file.

'-fkeep-static-consts'
     Emit variables declared 'static const' when optimization isn't
     turned on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

     GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the
     compiler to check if a variable is referenced, regardless of
     whether or not optimization is turned on, use the
     '-fno-keep-static-consts' option.

'-fmerge-constants'
     Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and
     floating-point constants) across compilation units.

     This option is the default for optimized compilation if the
     assembler and linker support it.  Use '-fno-merge-constants' to
     inhibit this behavior.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fmerge-all-constants'
     Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

     This option implies '-fmerge-constants'.  In addition to
     '-fmerge-constants' this considers e.g. even constant initialized
     arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or
     floating-point types.  Languages like C or C++ require each
     variable, including multiple instances of the same variable in
     recursive calls, to have distinct locations, so using this option
     results in non-conforming behavior.

'-fmodulo-sched'
     Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first
     scheduling pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders
     their instructions by overlapping different iterations.

'-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves'
     Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register
     moves allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges
     are deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on
     the life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
     '-fmodulo-sched' enabled.

'-fno-branch-count-reg'
     Do not use "decrement and branch" instructions on a count register,
     but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
     register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the
     result.  This option is only meaningful on architectures that
     support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and
     S/390.

     The default is '-fbranch-count-reg'.

'-fno-function-cse'
     Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction
     that calls a constant function contain the function's address
     explicitly.

     This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
     that alter the assembler output may be confused by the
     optimizations performed when this option is not used.

     The default is '-ffunction-cse'

'-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss'
     If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables
     that are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save space in the
     resulting code.

     This option turns off this behavior because some programs
     explicitly rely on variables going to the data section--e.g., so
     that the resulting executable can find the beginning of that
     section and/or make assumptions based on that.

     The default is '-fzero-initialized-in-bss'.

'-fthread-jumps'
     Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
     location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.
     If so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of
     the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on
     whether the condition is known to be true or false.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fsplit-wide-types'
     When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as 'long
     long' on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate
     them independently.  This normally generates better code for those
     types, but may make debugging more difficult.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fcse-follow-jumps'
     In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump
     instructions when the target of the jump is not reached by any
     other path.  For example, when CSE encounters an 'if' statement
     with an 'else' clause, CSE follows the jump when the condition
     tested is false.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fcse-skip-blocks'
     This is similar to '-fcse-follow-jumps', but causes CSE to follow
     jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE encounters a
     simple 'if' statement with no else clause, '-fcse-skip-blocks'
     causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of the 'if'.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-frerun-cse-after-loop'
     Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations
     are performed.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fgcse'
     Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.  This pass
     also performs global constant and copy propagation.

     _Note:_ When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
     extension, you may get better run-time performance if you disable
     the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
     '-fno-gcse' to the command line.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fgcse-lm'
     When '-fgcse-lm' is enabled, global common subexpression
     elimination attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores
     into themselves.  This allows a loop containing a load/store
     sequence to be changed to a load outside the loop, and a copy/store
     within the loop.

     Enabled by default when '-fgcse' is enabled.

'-fgcse-sm'
     When '-fgcse-sm' is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
     global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to
     move stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with
     '-fgcse-lm', loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed
     to a load before the loop and a store after the loop.

     Not enabled at any optimization level.

'-fgcse-las'
     When '-fgcse-las' is enabled, the global common subexpression
     elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores
     to the same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).

     Not enabled at any optimization level.

'-fgcse-after-reload'
     When '-fgcse-after-reload' is enabled, a redundant load elimination
     pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to
     clean up redundant spilling.

'-faggressive-loop-optimizations'
     This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
     derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes
     that loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example
     causing signed integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.
     The bounds for the number of iterations of a loop are used to guide
     loop unrolling and peeling and loop exit test optimizations.  This
     option is enabled by default.

'-funsafe-loop-optimizations'
     This option tells the loop optimizer to assume that loop indices do
     not overflow, and that loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
     infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
     the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are
     valid.  If you use '-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations', the compiler
     warns you if it finds this kind of loop.

'-fcrossjumping'
     Perform cross-jumping transformation.  This transformation unifies
     equivalent code and saves code size.  The resulting code may or may
     not perform better than without cross-jumping.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fauto-inc-dec'
     Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
     This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
     instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at '-O' and
     higher on architectures that support this.

'-fdce'
     Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL.  Enabled by default at
     '-O' and higher.

'-fdse'
     Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL.  Enabled by default at
     '-O' and higher.

'-fif-conversion'
     Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
     equivalents.  This includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set
     flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable by standard
     arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution on chips where it is
     available is controlled by 'if-conversion2'.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fif-conversion2'
     Use conditional execution (where available) to transform
     conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fdeclone-ctor-dtor'
     The C++ ABI requires multiple entry points for constructors and
     destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object,
     and one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete
     afterwards.  For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and
     complete variants are clones, which means two copies of the
     function.  With this option, the base and complete variants are
     changed to be thunks that call a common implementation.

     Enabled by '-Os'.

'-fdelete-null-pointer-checks'
     Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and
     that no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple
     constant folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In
     addition, other optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control
     global dataflow analyses that eliminate useless checks for null
     pointers; these assume that if a pointer is checked after it has
     already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.

     Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
     Use '-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks' to disable this optimization
     for programs that depend on that behavior.

     Some targets, especially embedded ones, disable this option at all
     levels.  Otherwise it is enabled at all levels: '-O0', '-O1',
     '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.  Passes that use the information are enabled
     independently at different optimization levels.

'-fdevirtualize'
     Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.
     This is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part
     of indirect inlining ('-findirect-inlining') and interprocedural
     constant propagation ('-fipa-cp').  Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3',
     '-Os'.

'-fdevirtualize-speculatively'
     Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct
     calls.  Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph,
     determine for a given call the set of likely targets.  If the set
     is small, preferably of size 1, change the call into an conditional
     deciding on direct and indirect call.  The speculative calls enable
     more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem useless after
     further optimization, they are converted back into original form.

'-fexpensive-optimizations'
     Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
     expensive.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-free'
     Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions.  This is
     especially helpful for the x86-64 architecture, which implicitly
     zero-extends in 64-bit registers after writing to their lower
     32-bit half.

     Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-flive-range-shrinkage'
     Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live range
     shrinkage.  This is helpful for fast processors with small or
     moderate size register sets.

'-fira-algorithm=ALGORITHM'
     Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
     allocator.  The ALGORITHM argument can be 'priority', which
     specifies Chow's priority coloring, or 'CB', which specifies
     Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not
     implemented for all architectures, but for those targets that do
     support it, it is the default because it generates better code.

'-fira-region=REGION'
     Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
     REGION argument should be one of the following:

     'all'
          Use all loops as register allocation regions.  This can give
          the best results for machines with a small and/or irregular
          register set.

     'mixed'
          Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure as
          the regions.  This value usually gives the best results in
          most cases and for most architectures, and is enabled by
          default when compiling with optimization for speed ('-O',
          '-O2', ...).

     'one'
          Use all functions as a single region.  This typically results
          in the smallest code size, and is enabled by default for '-Os'
          or '-O0'.

'-fira-hoist-pressure'
     Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting pass for
     decisions to hoist expressions.  This option usually results in
     smaller code, but it can slow the compiler down.

     This option is enabled at level '-Os' for all targets.

'-fira-loop-pressure'
     Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to
     move loop invariants.  This option usually results in generation of
     faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (>=
     32 registers), but it can slow the compiler down.

     This option is enabled at level '-O3' for some targets.

'-fno-ira-share-save-slots'
     Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard
     registers living through a call.  Each hard register gets a
     separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are
     larger.

'-fno-ira-share-spill-slots'
     Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.
     Each pseudo-register that does not get a hard register gets a
     separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are
     larger.

'-fira-verbose=N'
     Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register
     allocator.  The default value is 5.  If the value N is greater or
     equal to 10, the dump output is sent to stderr using the same
     format as N minus 10.

'-fdelayed-branch'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to exploit instruction slots available after delayed
     branch instructions.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fschedule-insns'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required data
     being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating
     point or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions to
     be issued until the result of the load or floating-point
     instruction is required.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-fschedule-insns2'
     Similar to '-fschedule-insns', but requests an additional pass of
     instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.
     This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small
     number of registers and where memory load instructions take more
     than one cycle.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fno-sched-interblock'
     Don't schedule instructions across basic blocks.  This is normally
     enabled by default when scheduling before register allocation, i.e.
     with '-fschedule-insns' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fno-sched-spec'
     Don't allow speculative motion of non-load instructions.  This is
     normally enabled by default when scheduling before register
     allocation, i.e. with '-fschedule-insns' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-pressure'
     Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
     allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
     allocation is enabled, i.e. with '-fschedule-insns' or at '-O2' or
     higher.  Usage of this option can improve the generated code and
     decrease its size by preventing register pressure increase above
     the number of available hard registers and subsequent spills in
     register allocation.

'-fsched-spec-load'
     Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This only
     makes sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
     '-fschedule-insns' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-spec-load-dangerous'
     Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This only
     makes sense when scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
     '-fschedule-insns' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-stalled-insns'
'-fsched-stalled-insns=N'
     Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from the
     queue of stalled insns into the ready list during the second
     scheduling pass.  '-fno-sched-stalled-insns' means that no insns
     are moved prematurely, '-fsched-stalled-insns=0' means there is no
     limit on how many queued insns can be moved prematurely.
     '-fsched-stalled-insns' without a value is equivalent to
     '-fsched-stalled-insns=1'.

'-fsched-stalled-insns-dep'
'-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=N'
     Define how many insn groups (cycles) are examined for a dependency
     on a stalled insn that is a candidate for premature removal from
     the queue of stalled insns.  This has an effect only during the
     second scheduling pass, and only if '-fsched-stalled-insns' is
     used.  '-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep' is equivalent to
     '-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0'.  '-fsched-stalled-insns-dep' without
     a value is equivalent to '-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1'.

'-fsched2-use-superblocks'
     When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock
     scheduling.  This allows motion across basic block boundaries,
     resulting in faster schedules.  This option is experimental, as not
     all machine descriptions used by GCC model the CPU closely enough
     to avoid unreliable results from the algorithm.

     This only makes sense when scheduling after register allocation,
     i.e. with '-fschedule-insns2' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-group-heuristic'
     Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
     the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.  This is enabled
     by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with '-fschedule-insns'
     or '-fschedule-insns2' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-critical-path-heuristic'
     Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler.  This
     heuristic favors instructions on the critical path.  This is
     enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with
     '-fschedule-insns' or '-fschedule-insns2' or at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic'
     Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the scheduler.
     This heuristic favors speculative instructions with greater
     dependency weakness.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is
     enabled, i.e. with '-fschedule-insns' or '-fschedule-insns2' or at
     '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-rank-heuristic'
     Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic favors
     the instruction belonging to a basic block with greater size or
     frequency.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled,
     i.e. with '-fschedule-insns' or '-fschedule-insns2' or at '-O2' or
     higher.

'-fsched-last-insn-heuristic'
     Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This
     heuristic favors the instruction that is less dependent on the last
     instruction scheduled.  This is enabled by default when scheduling
     is enabled, i.e. with '-fschedule-insns' or '-fschedule-insns2' or
     at '-O2' or higher.

'-fsched-dep-count-heuristic'
     Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler.  This
     heuristic favors the instruction that has more instructions
     depending on it.  This is enabled by default when scheduling is
     enabled, i.e. with '-fschedule-insns' or '-fschedule-insns2' or at
     '-O2' or higher.

'-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops'
     Modulo scheduling is performed before traditional scheduling.  If a
     loop is modulo scheduled, later scheduling passes may change its
     schedule.  Use this option to control that behavior.

'-fselective-scheduling'
     Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
     Selective scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler pass.

'-fselective-scheduling2'
     Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
     Selective scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler pass.

'-fsel-sched-pipelining'
     Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective
     scheduling.  This option has no effect unless one of
     '-fselective-scheduling' or '-fselective-scheduling2' is turned on.

'-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops'
     When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also pipeline
     outer loops.  This option has no effect unless
     '-fsel-sched-pipelining' is turned on.

'-fshrink-wrap'
     Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need
     it, rather than at the top of the function.  This flag is enabled
     by default at '-O' and higher.

'-fcaller-saves'
     Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by
     function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore
     the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when
     it seems to result in better code.

     This option is always enabled by default on certain machines,
     usually those which have no call-preserved registers to use
     instead.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fcombine-stack-adjustments'
     Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory
     references and then tries to find ways to combine them.

     Enabled by default at '-O1' and higher.

'-fconserve-stack'
     Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
     stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
     implies setting the 'large-stack-frame' parameter to 100 and the
     'large-stack-frame-growth' parameter to 400.

'-ftree-reassoc'
     Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default at
     '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-pre'
     Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag
     is enabled by default at '-O2' and '-O3'.

'-ftree-partial-pre'
     Make partial redundancy elimination (PRE) more aggressive.  This
     flag is enabled by default at '-O3'.

'-ftree-forwprop'
     Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-fre'
     Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
     between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions that are
     computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.  This
     analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
     This flag is enabled by default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-phiprop'
     Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
     pass is enabled by default at '-O' and higher.

'-fhoist-adjacent-loads'
     Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if
     the loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the
     target architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag
     is enabled by default at '-O2' and higher.

'-ftree-copy-prop'
     Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates
     unnecessary copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at
     '-O' and higher.

'-fipa-pure-const'
     Discover which functions are pure or constant.  Enabled by default
     at '-O' and higher.

'-fipa-reference'
     Discover which static variables do not escape the compilation unit.
     Enabled by default at '-O' and higher.

'-fipa-pta'
     Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural
     modification and reference analysis.  This option can cause
     excessive memory and compile-time usage on large compilation units.
     It is not enabled by default at any optimization level.

'-fipa-profile'
     Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called
     only from cold functions are marked as cold.  Also functions
     executed once (such as 'cold', 'noreturn', static constructors or
     destructors) are identified.  Cold functions and loop less parts of
     functions executed once are then optimized for size.  Enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-fipa-cp'
     Perform interprocedural constant propagation.  This optimization
     analyzes the program to determine when values passed to functions
     are constants and then optimizes accordingly.  This optimization
     can substantially increase performance if the application has
     constants passed to functions.  This flag is enabled by default at
     '-O2', '-Os' and '-O3'.

'-fipa-cp-clone'
     Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant
     propagation stronger.  When enabled, interprocedural constant
     propagation performs function cloning when externally visible
     function can be called with constant arguments.  Because this
     optimization can create multiple copies of functions, it may
     significantly increase code size (see '--param
     ipcp-unit-growth=VALUE').  This flag is enabled by default at
     '-O3'.

'-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference'
     Detect paths which trigger erroneous or undefined behaviour due to
     dereferencing a NULL pointer.  Isolate those paths from the main
     control flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined
     behaviour into a trap.

'-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute'
     Detect paths which trigger erroneous or undefined behaviour due a
     NULL value being used in a way which is forbidden by a
     'returns_nonnull' or 'nonnull' attribute.  Isolate those paths from
     the main control flow and turn the statement with erroneous or
     undefined behaviour into a trap.  This is not currently enabled,
     but may be enabled by '-O2' in the future.

'-ftree-sink'
     Perform forward store motion on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-bit-ccp'
     Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and
     propagate pointer alignment information.  This pass only operates
     on local scalar variables and is enabled by default at '-O' and
     higher.  It requires that '-ftree-ccp' is enabled.

'-ftree-ccp'
     Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on trees.
     This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-switch-conversion'
     Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
     initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by
     default at '-O2' and higher.

'-ftree-tail-merge'
     Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a
     jump to the other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or
     cross jumping.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O2' and
     higher.  The compilation time in this pass can be limited using
     'max-tail-merge-comparisons' parameter and
     'max-tail-merge-iterations' parameter.

'-ftree-dce'
     Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is enabled
     by default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-builtin-call-dce'
     Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to
     built-in functions that may set 'errno' but are otherwise
     side-effect free.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O2' and
     higher if '-Os' is not also specified.

'-ftree-dominator-opts'
     Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
     propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and
     expression simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.
     This also performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps).  This
     flag is enabled by default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-dse'
     Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a
     store into a memory location that is later overwritten by another
     store without any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier
     store can be deleted.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O' and
     higher.

'-ftree-ch'
     Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it
     increases effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also
     saves one jump.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O' and
     higher.  It is not enabled for '-Os', since it usually increases
     code size.

'-ftree-loop-optimize'
     Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-loop-linear'
     Perform loop interchange transformations on tree.  Same as
     '-floop-interchange'.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to
     be configured with '--with-ppl' and '--with-cloog' to enable the
     Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

'-floop-interchange'
     Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging
     two nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example,
     given a loop like:
          DO J = 1, M
            DO I = 1, N
              A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     loop interchange transforms the loop as if it were written:
          DO I = 1, N
            DO J = 1, M
              A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     which can be beneficial when 'N' is larger than the caches, because
     in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
     contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
     potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This
     optimization applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is
     not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has
     to be configured with '--with-ppl' and '--with-cloog' to enable the
     Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

'-floop-strip-mine'
     Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
     splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
     equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
     original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
     using the 'loop-block-tile-size' parameter.  For example, given a
     loop like:
          DO I = 1, N
            A(I) = A(I) + C
          ENDDO
     loop strip mining transforms the loop as if it were written:
          DO II = 1, N, 51
            DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
              A(I) = A(I) + C
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     This optimization applies to all the languages supported by GCC and
     is not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC
     has to be configured with '--with-ppl' and '--with-cloog' to enable
     the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

'-floop-block'
     Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip
     mines each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of
     the element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be
     changed using the 'loop-block-tile-size' parameter.  For example,
     given a loop like:
          DO I = 1, N
            DO J = 1, M
              A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     loop blocking transforms the loop as if it were written:
          DO II = 1, N, 51
            DO JJ = 1, M, 51
              DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
                DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
                  A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
                ENDDO
              ENDDO
            ENDDO
          ENDDO
     which can be beneficial when 'M' is larger than the caches, because
     the innermost loop iterates over a smaller amount of data which can
     be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to all the
     languages supported by GCC and is not limited to Fortran.  To use
     this code transformation, GCC has to be configured with
     '--with-ppl' and '--with-cloog' to enable the Graphite loop
     transformation infrastructure.

'-fgraphite-identity'
     Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we
     generate the polyhedral representation and transform it back to
     gimple.  Using '-fgraphite-identity' we can check the costs or
     benefits of the GIMPLE -> GRAPHITE -> GIMPLE transformation.  Some
     minimal optimizations are also performed by the code generator
     CLooG, like index splitting and dead code elimination in loops.

'-floop-nest-optimize'
     Enable the ISL based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop
     nest optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It
     calculates a loop structure optimized for data-locality and
     parallelism.  This option is experimental.

'-floop-parallelize-all'
     Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that
     can be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be
     analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences without checking
     that it is profitable to parallelize the loops.

'-fcheck-data-deps'
     Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.  This
     option is used for debugging the data dependence analyzers.

'-ftree-loop-if-convert'
     Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
     branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
     the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
     vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by
     default if vectorization is enabled.

'-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores'
     Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory
     writes.  This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded
     programs as it transforms conditional memory writes into
     unconditional memory writes.  For example,
          for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
            if (cond)
              A[i] = expr;
     is transformed to
          for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
            A[i] = cond ? expr : A[i];
     potentially producing data races.

'-ftree-loop-distribution'
     Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance
     on big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
     parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the
     loop
          DO I = 1, N
            A(I) = B(I) + C
            D(I) = E(I) * F
          ENDDO
     is transformed to
          DO I = 1, N
             A(I) = B(I) + C
          ENDDO
          DO I = 1, N
             D(I) = E(I) * F
          ENDDO

'-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns'
     Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated
     with calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O3'.

     This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call
     to memset zero.  For example, the loop
          DO I = 1, N
            A(I) = 0
            B(I) = A(I) + I
          ENDDO
     is transformed to
          DO I = 1, N
             A(I) = 0
          ENDDO
          DO I = 1, N
             B(I) = A(I) + I
          ENDDO
     and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset
     zero.

'-ftree-loop-im'
     Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only
     invariants that are hard to handle at RTL level (function calls,
     operations that expand to nontrivial sequences of insns).  With
     '-funswitch-loops' it also moves operands of conditions that are
     invariant out of the loop, so that we can use just trivial
     invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
     store motion.

'-ftree-loop-ivcanon'
     Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for
     which determining number of iterations requires complicated
     analysis.  Later optimizations then may determine the number
     easily.  Useful especially in connection with unrolling.

'-fivopts'
     Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction,
     induction variable merging and induction variable elimination) on
     trees.

'-ftree-parallelize-loops=n'
     Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n
     threads.  This is only possible for loops whose iterations are
     independent and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is
     only profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are
     CPU-intensive, rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.
     This option implies '-pthread', and thus is only supported on
     targets that have support for '-pthread'.

'-ftree-pta'
     Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
     enabled by default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-sra'
     Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces
     structure references with scalars to prevent committing structures
     to memory too early.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O' and
     higher.

'-ftree-copyrename'
     Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename
     compiler temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually
     resulting in variable names which more closely resemble the
     original variables.  This flag is enabled by default at '-O' and
     higher.

'-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars'
     Tell the copyrename pass (see '-ftree-copyrename') to attempt to
     combine small user-defined variables too, but only if they were
     inlined from other functions.  It is a more limited form of
     '-ftree-coalesce-vars'.  This may harm debug information of such
     inlined variables, but it will keep variables of the inlined-into
     function apart from each other, such that they are more likely to
     contain the expected values in a debugging session.  This was the
     default in GCC versions older than 4.7.

'-ftree-coalesce-vars'
     Tell the copyrename pass (see '-ftree-copyrename') to attempt to
     combine small user-defined variables too, instead of just compiler
     temporaries.  This may severely limit the ability to debug an
     optimized program compiled with '-fno-var-tracking-assignments'.
     In the negated form, this flag prevents SSA coalescing of user
     variables, including inlined ones.  This option is enabled by
     default.

'-ftree-ter'
     Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA->normal
     phase.  Single use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use
     location with their defining expression.  This results in
     non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders much more complex trees to
     work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-slsr'
     Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes
     related expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by
     less expensive calculations when possible.  This is enabled by
     default at '-O' and higher.

'-ftree-vectorize'
     Perform vectorization on trees.  This flag enables
     '-ftree-loop-vectorize' and '-ftree-slp-vectorize' if not
     explicitly specified.

'-ftree-loop-vectorize'
     Perform loop vectorization on trees.  This flag is enabled by
     default at '-O3' and when '-ftree-vectorize' is enabled.

'-ftree-slp-vectorize'
     Perform basic block vectorization on trees.  This flag is enabled
     by default at '-O3' and when '-ftree-vectorize' is enabled.

'-fvect-cost-model=MODEL'
     Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The MODEL argument
     should be one of 'unlimited', 'dynamic' or 'cheap'.  With the
     'unlimited' model the vectorized code-path is assumed to be
     profitable while with the 'dynamic' model a runtime check will
     guard the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration
     counts that will likely execute faster than when executing the
     original scalar loop.  The 'cheap' model will disable vectorization
     of loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due
     to required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but
     otherwise is equal to the 'dynamic' model.  The default cost model
     depends on other optimization flags and is either 'dynamic' or
     'cheap'.

'-fsimd-cost-model=MODEL'
     Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with
     the OpenMP or Cilk Plus simd directive.  The MODEL argument should
     be one of 'unlimited', 'dynamic', 'cheap'.  All values of MODEL
     have the same meaning as described in '-fvect-cost-model' and by
     default a cost model defined with '-fvect-cost-model' is used.

'-ftree-vrp'
     Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
     constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values
     are propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary
     range checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This
     is enabled by default at '-O2' and higher.  Null pointer check
     elimination is only done if '-fdelete-null-pointer-checks' is
     enabled.

'-ftracer'
     Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This
     transformation simplifies the control flow of the function allowing
     other optimizations to do a better job.

'-funroll-loops'
     Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
     compile time or upon entry to the loop.  '-funroll-loops' implies
     '-frerun-cse-after-loop'.  This option makes code larger, and may
     or may not make it run faster.

'-funroll-all-loops'
     Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain
     when the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more
     slowly.  '-funroll-all-loops' implies the same options as
     '-funroll-loops',

'-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller'
     Enables expression of values of induction variables in later
     iterations of the unrolled loop using the value in the first
     iteration.  This breaks long dependency chains, thus improving
     efficiency of the scheduling passes.

     A combination of '-fweb' and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the
     same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop
     body is more complicated than a single basic block.  It also does
     not work at all on some architectures due to restrictions in the
     CSE pass.

     This optimization is enabled by default.

'-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller'
     With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some
     local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result in superior
     code.

'-fpartial-inlining'
     Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only when
     inlining itself is turned on by the '-finline-functions' or
     '-finline-small-functions' options.

     Enabled at level '-O2'.

'-fpredictive-commoning'
     Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing
     computations (especially memory loads and stores) performed in
     previous iterations of loops.

     This option is enabled at level '-O3'.

'-fprefetch-loop-arrays'
     If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to
     prefetch memory to improve the performance of loops that access
     large arrays.

     This option may generate better or worse code; results are highly
     dependent on the structure of loops within the source code.

     Disabled at level '-Os'.

'-fno-peephole'
'-fno-peephole2'
     Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The
     difference between '-fno-peephole' and '-fno-peephole2' is in how
     they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some
     use the other, a few use both.

     '-fpeephole' is enabled by default.  '-fpeephole2' enabled at
     levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fno-guess-branch-probability'
     Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

     GCC uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are not
     provided by profiling feedback ('-fprofile-arcs').  These
     heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch
     probabilities are specified by '__builtin_expect', then the
     heuristics are used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of
     the control flow graph, taking the '__builtin_expect' info into
     account.  The interactions between the heuristics and
     '__builtin_expect' can be complex, and in some cases, it may be
     useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects of
     '__builtin_expect' are easier to understand.

     The default is '-fguess-branch-probability' at levels '-O', '-O2',
     '-O3', '-Os'.

'-freorder-blocks'
     Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce
     number of taken branches and improve code locality.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-freorder-blocks-and-partition'
     In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in
     order to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold
     basic blocks into separate sections of the assembly and .o files,
     to improve paging and cache locality performance.

     This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
     exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a
     user-defined section attribute and on any architecture that does
     not support named sections.

     Enabled for x86 at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-freorder-functions'
     Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve code
     locality.  This is implemented by using special subsections
     '.text.hot' for most frequently executed functions and
     '.text.unlikely' for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is
     done by the linker so object file format must support named
     sections and linker must place them in a reasonable way.

     Also profile feedback must be available to make this option
     effective.  See '-fprofile-arcs' for details.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fstrict-aliasing'
     Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules
     applicable to the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this
     activates optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In
     particular, an object of one type is assumed never to reside at the
     same address as an object of a different type, unless the types are
     almost the same.  For example, an 'unsigned int' can alias an
     'int', but not a 'void*' or a 'double'.  A character type may alias
     any other type.

     Pay special attention to code like this:
          union a_union {
            int i;
            double d;
          };

          int f() {
            union a_union t;
            t.d = 3.0;
            return t.i;
          }
     The practice of reading from a different union member than the one
     most recently written to (called "type-punning") is common.  Even
     with '-fstrict-aliasing', type-punning is allowed, provided the
     memory is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above
     works as expected.  *Note Structures unions enumerations and
     bit-fields implementation::.  However, this code might not:
          int f() {
            union a_union t;
            int* ip;
            t.d = 3.0;
            ip = &t.i;
            return *ip;
          }

     Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting
     pointer and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even
     if the cast uses a union type, e.g.:
          int f() {
            double d = 3.0;
            return ((union a_union *) &d)->i;
          }

     The '-fstrict-aliasing' option is enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3',
     '-Os'.

'-fstrict-overflow'
     Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules,
     depending on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this
     means that overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is
     undefined, which means that the compiler may assume that it does
     not happen.  This permits various optimizations.  For example, the
     compiler assumes that an expression like 'i + 10 > i' is always
     true for signed 'i'.  This assumption is only valid if signed
     overflow is undefined, as the expression is false if 'i + 10'
     overflows when using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option
     is in effect any attempt to determine whether an operation on
     signed numbers overflows must be written carefully to not actually
     involve overflow.

     This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
     semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to
     that pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the
     addition is undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that
     'p + u > p' is always true for a pointer 'p' and unsigned integer
     'u'.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
     undefined, as the expression is false if 'p + u' overflows using
     twos complement arithmetic.

     See also the '-fwrapv' option.  Using '-fwrapv' means that integer
     signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When '-fwrapv' is
     used, there is no difference between '-fstrict-overflow' and
     '-fno-strict-overflow' for integers.  With '-fwrapv' certain types
     of overflow are permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an
     overflow when doing arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value
     can still be used with '-fwrapv', but not otherwise.

     The '-fstrict-overflow' option is enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3',
     '-Os'.

'-falign-functions'
'-falign-functions=N'
     Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater than
     N, skipping up to N bytes.  For instance, '-falign-functions=32'
     aligns functions to the next 32-byte boundary, but
     '-falign-functions=24' aligns to the next 32-byte boundary only if
     this can be done by skipping 23 bytes or less.

     '-fno-align-functions' and '-falign-functions=1' are equivalent and
     mean that functions are not aligned.

     Some assemblers only support this flag when N is a power of two; in
     that case, it is rounded up.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-falign-labels'
'-falign-labels=N'
     Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to
     N bytes like '-falign-functions'.  This option can easily make code
     slower, because it must insert dummy operations for when the branch
     target is reached in the usual flow of the code.

     '-fno-align-labels' and '-falign-labels=1' are equivalent and mean
     that labels are not aligned.

     If '-falign-loops' or '-falign-jumps' are applicable and are
     greater than this value, then their values are used instead.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default
     which is very likely to be '1', meaning no alignment.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-falign-loops'
'-falign-loops=N'
     Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to N bytes like
     '-falign-functions'.  If the loops are executed many times, this
     makes up for any execution of the dummy operations.

     '-fno-align-loops' and '-falign-loops=1' are equivalent and mean
     that loops are not aligned.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-falign-jumps'
'-falign-jumps=N'
     Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch targets
     where the targets can only be reached by jumping, skipping up to N
     bytes like '-falign-functions'.  In this case, no dummy operations
     need be executed.

     '-fno-align-jumps' and '-falign-jumps=1' are equivalent and mean
     that loops are not aligned.

     If N is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent default.

     Enabled at levels '-O2', '-O3'.

'-funit-at-a-time'
     This option is left for compatibility reasons.  '-funit-at-a-time'
     has no effect, while '-fno-unit-at-a-time' implies
     '-fno-toplevel-reorder' and '-fno-section-anchors'.

     Enabled by default.

'-fno-toplevel-reorder'
     Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and 'asm'
     statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
     input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static
     variables are not removed.  This option is intended to support
     existing code that relies on a particular ordering.  For new code,
     it is better to use attributes when possible.

     Enabled at level '-O0'.  When disabled explicitly, it also implies
     '-fno-section-anchors', which is otherwise enabled at '-O0' on some
     targets.

'-fweb'
     Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes
     and assign each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the
     register allocation pass to operate on pseudos directly, but also
     strengthens several other optimization passes, such as CSE, loop
     optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can, however, make
     debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a "home
     register".

     Enabled by default with '-funroll-loops'.

'-fwhole-program'
     Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole
     program being compiled.  All public functions and variables with
     the exception of 'main' and those merged by attribute
     'externally_visible' become static functions and in effect are
     optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.

     This option should not be used in combination with '-flto'.
     Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more
     precise information.

'-flto[=N]'
     This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
     with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
     representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the
     object file.  When the object files are linked together, all the
     function bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated
     as if they had been part of the same translation unit.

     To use the link-time optimizer, '-flto' and optimization options
     should be specified at compile time and during the final link.  For
     example:

          gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o

     The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation of
     GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside 'foo.o' and 'bar.o'.  The
     final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from 'foo.o' and
     'bar.o', merges the two files into a single internal image, and
     compiles the result as usual.  Since both 'foo.o' and 'bar.o' are
     merged into a single image, this causes all the interprocedural
     analyses and optimizations in GCC to work across the two files as
     if they were a single one.  This means, for example, that the
     inliner is able to inline functions in 'bar.o' into functions in
     'foo.o' and vice-versa.

     Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:

          gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c

     The above generates bytecode for 'foo.c' and 'bar.c', merges them
     together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes them as
     usual to produce 'myprog'.

     The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable
     link-time optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform
     the link-step.  GCC then automatically performs link-time
     optimization if any of the objects involved were compiled with the
     '-flto'.  You generally should specify the optimization options to
     be used for link-time optimization though GCC will try to be clever
     at guessing an optimization level to use from the options used at
     compile-time if you fail to specify one at link-time.  You can
     always override the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
     at link-time by passing '-fno-lto' to the link command.

     To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to
     make certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
     what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and
     runtime outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by
     the linker, the linker plugin (see '-fuse-linker-plugin') passes
     information to the compiler about used and externally visible
     symbols.  When the linker plugin is not available,
     '-fwhole-program' should be used to allow the compiler to make
     these assumptions, which leads to more aggressive optimization
     decisions.

     When '-fuse-linker-plugin' is not enabled then, when a file is
     compiled with '-flto', the generated object file is larger than a
     regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the
     usual final code (see '-ffat-lto-objects'.  This means that object
     files with LTO information can be linked as normal object files; if
     '-fno-lto' is passed to the linker, no interprocedural
     optimizations are applied.  Note that when '-fno-fat-lto-objects'
     is enabled the compile-stage is faster but you cannot perform a
     regular, non-LTO link on them.

     Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual
     files are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For
     instance,

          gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto foo.c
          gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto bar.c
          gcc -o myprog -O3 foo.o bar.o

     This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
     code, but the resulting binary 'myprog' is optimized at '-O3'.  If,
     instead, the final binary is generated with '-fno-lto', then
     'myprog' is not optimized.

     When producing the final binary, GCC only applies link-time
     optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.  Therefore, you
     can mix and match object files and libraries with GIMPLE bytecodes
     and final object code.  GCC automatically selects which files to
     optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without further
     processing.

     There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
     generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
     stage.  Generally options specified at link-time override those
     specified at compile-time.

     If you do not specify an optimization level option '-O' at
     link-time then GCC will compute one based on the optimization
     levels used when compiling the object files.  The highest
     optimization level will win here.

     Currently, the following options and their setting are take from
     the first object file that explicitely specified it: '-fPIC',
     '-fpic', '-fpie', '-fcommon', '-fexceptions',
     '-fnon-call-exceptions', '-fgnu-tm' and all the '-m' target flags.

     Certain ABI changing flags are required to match in all
     compilation-units and trying to override this at link-time with a
     conflicting value is ignored.  This includes options such as
     '-freg-struct-return' and '-fpcc-struct-return'.

     Other options such as '-ffp-contract', '-fno-strict-overflow',
     '-fwrapv', '-fno-trapv' or '-fno-strict-aliasing' are passed
     through to the link stage and merged conservatively for conflicting
     translation units.  Specifically '-fno-strict-overflow', '-fwrapv'
     and '-fno-trapv' take precedence and for example
     '-ffp-contract=off' takes precedence over '-ffp-contract=fast'.
     You can override them at linke-time.

     It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in
     the same link with the same options and also specify those options
     at link time.

     If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
     types in separate translation units to be linked together
     (undefined behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal
     diagnostic may be issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run
     time.  Similar diagnostics may be raised for other languages.

     Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply
     interprocedural optimizations on files written in different
     languages:

          gcc -c -flto foo.c
          g++ -c -flto bar.cc
          gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
          g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran

     Notice that the final link is done with 'g++' to get the C++
     runtime libraries and '-lgfortran' is added to get the Fortran
     runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode,
     you should use the same link command options as when mixing
     languages in a regular (non-LTO) compilation.

     If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library
     archive, say 'libfoo.a', it is possible to extract and use them in
     an LTO link if you are using a linker with plugin support.  To
     create static libraries suitable for LTO, use 'gcc-ar' and
     'gcc-ranlib' instead of 'ar' and 'ranlib'; to show the symbols of
     object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use 'gcc-nm'.  Those commands
     require that 'ar', 'ranlib' and 'nm' have been compiled with plugin
     support.  At link time, use the the flag '-fuse-linker-plugin' to
     ensure that the library participates in the LTO optimization
     process:

          gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo

     With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
     GIMPLE files from 'libfoo.a' and passes them on to the running GCC
     to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.

     If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
     enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside 'libfoo.a' are
     extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate in the
     LTO optimization process.  In order to make a static library
     suitable for both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its
     object files with '-flto' '-ffat-lto-objects'.

     Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole
     program to operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to
     be exported, it is possible to combine '-flto' and
     '-fwhole-program' to allow the interprocedural optimizers to use
     more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved optimization
     opportunities.  Use of '-fwhole-program' is not needed when linker
     plugin is active (see '-fuse-linker-plugin').

     The current implementation of LTO makes no attempt to generate
     bytecode that is portable between different types of hosts.  The
     bytecode files are versioned and there is a strict version check,
     so bytecode files generated in one version of GCC will not work
     with an older or newer version of GCC.

     Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of
     debugging information.  Combining '-flto' with '-g' is currently
     experimental and expected to produce unexpected results.

     If you specify the optional N, the optimization and code generation
     done at link time is executed in parallel using N parallel jobs by
     utilizing an installed 'make' program.  The environment variable
     'MAKE' may be used to override the program used.  The default value
     for N is 1.

     You can also specify '-flto=jobserver' to use GNU make's job server
     mode to determine the number of parallel jobs.  This is useful when
     the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.  You
     must prepend a '+' to the command recipe in the parent Makefile for
     this to work.  This option likely only works if 'MAKE' is GNU make.

'-flto-partition=ALG'
     Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
     The value is either '1to1' to specify a partitioning mirroring the
     original source files or 'balanced' to specify partitioning into
     equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or 'max' to create new
     partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying 'none' as an
     algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely.  The
     default value is 'balanced'.  While '1to1' can be used as an
     workaround for various code ordering issues, the 'max' partitioning
     is intended for internal testing only.

'-flto-compression-level=N'
     This option specifies the level of compression used for
     intermediate language written to LTO object files, and is only
     meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode ('-flto').  Valid values
     are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values outside
     this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
     given, a default balanced compression setting is used.

'-flto-report'
     Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the
     link-time optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version
     to version.  It is meant to be useful to GCC developers when
     processing object files in LTO mode (via '-flto').

     Disabled by default.

'-flto-report-wpa'
     Like '-flto-report', but only print for the WPA phase of Link Time
     Optimization.

'-fuse-linker-plugin'
     Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.
     This option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is
     available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.

     This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE
     bytecode out of library archives.  This improves the quality of
     optimization by exposing more code to the link-time optimizer.
     This information specifies what symbols can be accessed externally
     (by non-LTO object or during dynamic linking).  Resulting code
     quality improvements on binaries (and shared libraries that use
     hidden visibility) are similar to '-fwhole-program'.  See '-flto'
     for a description of the effect of this flag and how to use it.

     This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is
     enabled and GCC was configured for use with a linker supporting
     plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).

'-ffat-lto-objects'
     Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate
     language and the object code.  This makes them usable for both LTO
     linking and normal linking.  This option is effective only when
     compiling with '-flto' and is ignored at link time.

     '-fno-fat-lto-objects' improves compilation time over plain LTO,
     but requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires
     a linker with linker plugin support for basic functionality.
     Additionally, 'nm', 'ar' and 'ranlib' need to support linker
     plugins to allow a full-featured build environment (capable of
     building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the 'gcc-ar',
     'gcc-nm', 'gcc-ranlib' wrappers to pass the right options to these
     tools.  With non fat LTO makefiles need to be modified to use them.

     The default is '-fno-fat-lto-objects' on targets with linker plugin
     support.

'-fcompare-elim'
     After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction
     splitting, identify arithmetic instructions that compute processor
     flags similar to a comparison operation based on that arithmetic.
     If possible, eliminate the explicit comparison operation.

     This pass only applies to certain targets that cannot explicitly
     represent the comparison operation before register allocation is
     complete.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fuse-ld=bfd'
     Use the 'bfd' linker instead of the default linker.

'-fuse-ld=gold'
     Use the 'gold' linker instead of the default linker.

'-fcprop-registers'
     After register allocation and post-register allocation instruction
     splitting, perform a copy-propagation pass to try to reduce
     scheduling dependencies and occasionally eliminate the copy.

     Enabled at levels '-O', '-O2', '-O3', '-Os'.

'-fprofile-correction'
     Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded
     programs may be inconsistent due to missed counter updates.  When
     this option is specified, GCC uses heuristics to correct or smooth
     out such inconsistencies.  By default, GCC emits an error message
     when an inconsistent profile is detected.

'-fprofile-dir=PATH'

     Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to PATH.
     This option affects only the profile data generated by
     '-fprofile-generate', '-ftest-coverage', '-fprofile-arcs' and used
     by '-fprofile-use' and '-fbranch-probabilities' and its related
     options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.  By
     default, GCC uses the current directory as PATH, thus the profile
     data file appears in the same directory as the object file.

'-fprofile-generate'
'-fprofile-generate=PATH'

     Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to
     produce profile useful for later recompilation with profile
     feedback based optimization.  You must use '-fprofile-generate'
     both when compiling and when linking your program.

     The following options are enabled: '-fprofile-arcs',
     '-fprofile-values', '-fvpt'.

     If PATH is specified, GCC looks at the PATH to find the profile
     feedback data files.  See '-fprofile-dir'.

'-fprofile-use'
'-fprofile-use=PATH'
     Enable profile feedback directed optimizations, and optimizations
     generally profitable only with profile feedback available.

     The following options are enabled: '-fbranch-probabilities',
     '-fvpt', '-funroll-loops', '-fpeel-loops', '-ftracer',
     '-ftree-vectorize', 'ftree-loop-distribute-patterns'

     By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback profiles do
     not match the source code.  This error can be turned into a warning
     by using '-Wcoverage-mismatch'.  Note this may result in poorly
     optimized code.

     If PATH is specified, GCC looks at the PATH to find the profile
     feedback data files.  See '-fprofile-dir'.

 The following options control compiler behavior regarding
floating-point arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

'-ffloat-store'
     Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit
     other options that might change whether a floating-point value is
     taken from a register or memory.

     This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such
     as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
     precision than a 'double' is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
     x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does
     only good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of
     IEEE floating point.  Use '-ffloat-store' for such programs, after
     modifying them to store all pertinent intermediate computations
     into variables.

'-fexcess-precision=STYLE'
     This option allows further control over excess precision on
     machines where floating-point registers have more precision than
     the IEEE 'float' and 'double' types and the processor does not
     support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
     '-fexcess-precision=fast' is in effect; this means that operations
     are carried out in the precision of the registers and that it is
     unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
     code takes place.  When compiling C, if
     '-fexcess-precision=standard' is specified then excess precision
     follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular, both casts
     and assignments cause values to be rounded to their semantic types
     (whereas '-ffloat-store' only affects assignments).  This option is
     enabled by default for C if a strict conformance option such as
     '-std=c99' is used.

     '-fexcess-precision=standard' is not implemented for languages
     other than C, and has no effect if '-funsafe-math-optimizations' or
     '-ffast-math' is specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if
     '-mfpmath=sse' or '-mfpmath=sse+387' is specified; in the former
     case, IEEE semantics apply without excess precision, and in the
     latter, rounding is unpredictable.

'-ffast-math'
     Sets '-fno-math-errno', '-funsafe-math-optimizations',
     '-ffinite-math-only', '-fno-rounding-math', '-fno-signaling-nans'
     and '-fcx-limited-range'.

     This option causes the preprocessor macro '__FAST_MATH__' to be
     defined.

     This option is not turned on by any '-O' option besides '-Ofast'
     since it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
     an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
     math functions.  It may, however, yield faster code for programs
     that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

'-fno-math-errno'
     Do not set 'errno' after calling math functions that are executed
     with a single instruction, e.g., 'sqrt'.  A program that relies on
     IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
     for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

     This option is not turned on by any '-O' option since it can result
     in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions.  It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.

     The default is '-fmath-errno'.

     On Darwin systems, the math library never sets 'errno'.  There is
     therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility
     that it might, and '-fno-math-errno' is the default.

'-funsafe-math-optimizations'

     Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
     that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate IEEE or
     ANSI standards.  When used at link-time, it may include libraries
     or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other
     similar optimizations.

     This option is not turned on by any '-O' option since it can result
     in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions.  It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.  Enables
     '-fno-signed-zeros', '-fno-trapping-math', '-fassociative-math' and
     '-freciprocal-math'.

     The default is '-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations'.

'-fassociative-math'

     Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point
     operations.  This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by
     possibly changing computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change
     the sign of zero as well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create
     underflow or overflow (and thus cannot be used on code that relies
     on rounding behavior like '(x + 2**52) - 2**52'.  May also reorder
     floating-point comparisons and thus may not be used when ordered
     comparisons are required.  This option requires that both
     '-fno-signed-zeros' and '-fno-trapping-math' be in effect.
     Moreover, it doesn't make much sense with '-frounding-math'.  For
     Fortran the option is automatically enabled when both
     '-fno-signed-zeros' and '-fno-trapping-math' are in effect.

     The default is '-fno-associative-math'.

'-freciprocal-math'

     Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
     the value if this enables optimizations.  For example 'x / y' can
     be replaced with 'x * (1/y)', which is useful if '(1/y)' is subject
     to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
     precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

     The default is '-fno-reciprocal-math'.

'-ffinite-math-only'
     Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that
     arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

     This option is not turned on by any '-O' option since it can result
     in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions.  It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
     not require the guarantees of these specifications.

     The default is '-fno-finite-math-only'.

'-fno-signed-zeros'
     Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
     signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
     distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
     of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with
     '-ffinite-math-only').  This option implies that the sign of a zero
     result isn't significant.

     The default is '-fsigned-zeros'.

'-fno-trapping-math'
     Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot
     generate user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero,
     overflow, underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This
     option requires that '-fno-signaling-nans' be in effect.  Setting
     this option may allow faster code if one relies on "non-stop" IEEE
     arithmetic, for example.

     This option should never be turned on by any '-O' option since it
     can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
     implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
     functions.

     The default is '-ftrapping-math'.

'-frounding-math'
     Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default
     floating-point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all
     floating point to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all
     other arithmetic truncations.  This option should be specified for
     programs that change the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may
     be executed with a non-default rounding mode.  This option disables
     constant folding of floating-point expressions at compile time
     (which may be affected by rounding mode) and arithmetic
     transformations that are unsafe in the presence of sign-dependent
     rounding modes.

     The default is '-fno-rounding-math'.

     This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
     disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
     Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this setting
     using C99's 'FENV_ACCESS' pragma.  This command-line option will be
     used to specify the default state for 'FENV_ACCESS'.

'-fsignaling-nans'
     Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate
     user-visible traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this
     option disables optimizations that may change the number of
     exceptions visible with signaling NaNs.  This option implies
     '-ftrapping-math'.

     This option causes the preprocessor macro '__SUPPORT_SNAN__' to be
     defined.

     The default is '-fno-signaling-nans'.

     This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
     disable all GCC optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.

'-fsingle-precision-constant'
     Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of
     implicitly converting them to double-precision constants.

'-fcx-limited-range'
     When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
     needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no
     checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division
     is 'NaN + I*NaN', with an attempt to rescue the situation in that
     case.  The default is '-fno-cx-limited-range', but is enabled by
     '-ffast-math'.

     This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
     'CX_LIMITED_RANGE' pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies to all
     languages.

'-fcx-fortran-rules'
     Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range
     reduction is done as part of complex division, but there is no
     checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division
     is 'NaN + I*NaN', with an attempt to rescue the situation in that
     case.

     The default is '-fno-cx-fortran-rules'.

 The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any '-O' options.  This section
includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

'-fbranch-probabilities'
     After running a program compiled with '-fprofile-arcs' (*note
     Options for Debugging Your Program or 'gcc': Debugging Options.),
     you can compile it a second time using '-fbranch-probabilities', to
     improve optimizations based on the number of times each branch was
     taken.  When a program compiled with '-fprofile-arcs' exits, it
     saves arc execution counts to a file called 'SOURCENAME.gcda' for
     each source file.  The information in this data file is very
     dependent on the structure of the generated code, so you must use
     the same source code and the same optimization options for both
     compilations.

     With '-fbranch-probabilities', GCC puts a 'REG_BR_PROB' note on
     each 'JUMP_INSN' and 'CALL_INSN'.  These can be used to improve
     optimization.  Currently, they are only used in one place: in
     'reorg.c', instead of guessing which path a branch is most likely
     to take, the 'REG_BR_PROB' values are used to exactly determine
     which path is taken more often.

'-fprofile-values'
     If combined with '-fprofile-arcs', it adds code so that some data
     about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

     With '-fbranch-probabilities', it reads back the data gathered from
     profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations.

     Enabled with '-fprofile-generate' and '-fprofile-use'.

'-fprofile-reorder-functions'
     Function reordering based on profile instrumentation collects first
     time of execution of a function and orders these functions in
     ascending order.

     Enabled with '-fprofile-use'.

'-fvpt'
     If combined with '-fprofile-arcs', this option instructs the
     compiler to add code to gather information about values of
     expressions.

     With '-fbranch-probabilities', it reads back the data gathered and
     actually performs the optimizations based on them.  Currently the
     optimizations include specialization of division operations using
     the knowledge about the value of the denominator.

'-frename-registers'
     Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
     of registers left over after register allocation.  This
     optimization most benefits processors with lots of registers.
     Depending on the debug information format adopted by the target,
     however, it can make debugging impossible, since variables no
     longer stay in a "home register".

     Enabled by default with '-funroll-loops' and '-fpeel-loops'.

'-ftracer'
     Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This
     transformation simplifies the control flow of the function allowing
     other optimizations to do a better job.

     Enabled with '-fprofile-use'.

'-funroll-loops'
     Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
     compile time or upon entry to the loop.  '-funroll-loops' implies
     '-frerun-cse-after-loop', '-fweb' and '-frename-registers'.  It
     also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops
     with a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes
     code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.

     Enabled with '-fprofile-use'.

'-funroll-all-loops'
     Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain
     when the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more
     slowly.  '-funroll-all-loops' implies the same options as
     '-funroll-loops'.

'-fpeel-loops'
     Peels loops for which there is enough information that they do not
     roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop
     peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number
     of iterations).

     Enabled with '-fprofile-use'.

'-fmove-loop-invariants'
     Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.
     Enabled at level '-O1'

'-funswitch-loops'
     Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with
     duplicates of the loop on both branches (modified according to
     result of the condition).

'-ffunction-sections'
'-fdata-sections'
     Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
     file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
     function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
     in the output file.

     Use these options on systems where the linker can perform
     optimizations to improve locality of reference in the instruction
     space.  Most systems using the ELF object format and SPARC
     processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with such optimizations.
     AIX may have these optimizations in the future.

     Only use these options when there are significant benefits from
     doing so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker
     create larger object and executable files and are also slower.  You
     cannot use 'gprof' on all systems if you specify this option, and
     you may have problems with debugging if you specify both this
     option and '-g'.

'-fbranch-target-load-optimize'
     Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue /
     epilogue threading.  The use of target registers can typically be
     exposed only during reload, thus hoisting loads out of loops and
     doing inter-block scheduling needs a separate optimization pass.

'-fbranch-target-load-optimize2'
     Perform branch target register load optimization after prologue /
     epilogue threading.

'-fbtr-bb-exclusive'
     When performing branch target register load optimization, don't
     reuse branch target registers within any basic block.

'-fstack-protector'
     Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
     smashing attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to
     functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that
     call 'alloca', and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The
     guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked
     when the function exits.  If a guard check fails, an error message
     is printed and the program exits.

'-fstack-protector-all'
     Like '-fstack-protector' except that all functions are protected.

'-fstack-protector-strong'
     Like '-fstack-protector' but includes additional functions to be
     protected -- those that have local array definitions, or have
     references to local frame addresses.

'-fsection-anchors'
     Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
     shared "anchor" symbols to address nearby objects.  This
     transformation can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT
     accesses on some targets.

     For example, the implementation of the following function 'foo':

          static int a, b, c;
          int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

     usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
     compile it with '-fsection-anchors', it accesses the variables from
     a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
     following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

          int foo (void)
          {
            register int *xr = &x;
            return xr[&a - &x] + xr[&b - &x] + xr[&c - &x];
          }

     Not all targets support this option.

'--param NAME=VALUE'
     In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
     optimization that is done.  For example, GCC does not inline
     functions that contain more than a certain number of instructions.
     You can control some of these constants on the command line using
     the '--param' option.

     The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values,
     are tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to
     change without notice in future releases.

     In each case, the VALUE is an integer.  The allowable choices for
     NAME are:

     'predictable-branch-outcome'
          When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower
          than this threshold (in percent), then it is considered well
          predictable.  The default is 10.

     'max-crossjump-edges'
          The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for
          cross-jumping.  The algorithm used by '-fcrossjumping' is
          O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block.
          Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making
          the compilation time increase with probably small improvement
          in executable size.

     'min-crossjump-insns'
          The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the
          end of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.
          This value is ignored in the case where all instructions in
          the block being cross-jumped from are matched.  The default
          value is 5.

     'max-grow-copy-bb-insns'
          The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic
          blocks instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a
          jump instruction.  The default value is 8.

     'max-goto-duplication-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block
          that jumps to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a
          number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the
          compilation process, and unfactors them as late as possible.
          Only computed jumps at the end of a basic blocks with no more
          than max-goto-duplication-insns are unfactored.  The default
          value is 8.

     'max-delay-slot-insn-search'
          The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking
          for an instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this
          arbitrary number of instructions are searched, the time
          savings from filling the delay slot are minimal, so stop
          searching.  Increasing values mean more aggressive
          optimization, making the compilation time increase with
          probably small improvement in execution time.

     'max-delay-slot-live-search'
          When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of
          instructions to consider when searching for a block with valid
          live register information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen
          value means more aggressive optimization, increasing the
          compilation time.  This parameter should be removed when the
          delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the control-flow
          graph.

     'max-gcse-memory'
          The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated
          in order to perform the global common subexpression
          elimination optimization.  If more memory than specified is
          required, the optimization is not done.

     'max-gcse-insertion-ratio'
          If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger
          than this value for any expression, then RTL PRE inserts or
          removes the expression and thus leaves partially redundant
          computations in the instruction stream.  The default value is
          20.

     'max-pending-list-length'
          The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
          before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large
          functions with few branches or calls can create excessively
          large lists which needlessly consume memory and resources.

     'max-modulo-backtrack-attempts'
          The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should
          make when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can
          exponentially increase compilation time.

     'max-inline-insns-single'
          Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC.  This
          number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in
          GCC's internal representation) in a single function that the
          tree inliner considers for inlining.  This only affects
          functions declared inline and methods implemented in a class
          declaration (C++).  The default value is 400.

     'max-inline-insns-auto'
          When you use '-finline-functions' (included in '-O3'), a lot
          of functions that would otherwise not be considered for
          inlining by the compiler are investigated.  To those
          functions, a different (more restrictive) limit compared to
          functions declared inline can be applied.  The default value
          is 40.

     'inline-min-speedup'
          When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee
          runtime exceeds this threshold (in precent), the function can
          be inlined regardless the limit on '--param
          max-inline-insns-single' and '--param max-inline-insns-auto'.

     'large-function-insns'
          The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions
          larger than this limit after inlining, inlining is constrained
          by '--param large-function-growth'.  This parameter is useful
          primarily to avoid extreme compilation time caused by
          non-linear algorithms used by the back end.  The default value
          is 2700.

     'large-function-growth'
          Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining
          in percents.  The default value is 100 which limits large
          function growth to 2.0 times the original size.

     'large-unit-insns'
          The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by
          inlining of units larger than this limit is limited by
          '--param inline-unit-growth'.  For small units this might be
          too tight.  For example, consider a unit consisting of
          function A that is inline and B that just calls A three times.
          If B is small relative to A, the growth of unit is 300\% and
          yet such inlining is very sane.  For very large units
          consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall
          unit growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of
          code size.  Thus for smaller units, the size is increased to
          '--param large-unit-insns' before applying '--param
          inline-unit-growth'.  The default is 10000.

     'inline-unit-growth'
          Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
          caused by inlining.  The default value is 30 which limits unit
          growth to 1.3 times the original size.

     'ipcp-unit-growth'
          Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
          caused by interprocedural constant propagation.  The default
          value is 10 which limits unit growth to 1.1 times the original
          size.

     'large-stack-frame'
          The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the
          algorithm is trying to not grow past this limit too much.  The
          default value is 256 bytes.

     'large-stack-frame-growth'
          Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by
          inlining in percents.  The default value is 1000 which limits
          large stack frame growth to 11 times the original size.

     'max-inline-insns-recursive'
     'max-inline-insns-recursive-auto'
          Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line
          copy of a self-recursive inline function can grow into by
          performing recursive inlining.

          For functions declared inline, '--param
          max-inline-insns-recursive' is taken into account.  For
          functions not declared inline, recursive inlining happens only
          when '-finline-functions' (included in '-O3') is enabled and
          '--param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto' is used.  The
          default value is 450.

     'max-inline-recursive-depth'
     'max-inline-recursive-depth-auto'
          Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive
          inlining.

          For functions declared inline, '--param
          max-inline-recursive-depth' is taken into account.  For
          functions not declared inline, recursive inlining happens only
          when '-finline-functions' (included in '-O3') is enabled and
          '--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto' is used.  The
          default value is 8.

     'min-inline-recursive-probability'
          Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep
          recursion in average and can hurt for function having little
          recursion depth by increasing the prologue size or complexity
          of function body to other optimizers.

          When profile feedback is available (see '-fprofile-generate')
          the actual recursion depth can be guessed from probability
          that function recurses via a given call expression.  This
          parameter limits inlining only to call expressions whose
          probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).  The
          default value is 10.

     'early-inlining-insns'
          Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it
          increases the amount of inlining for code having a large
          abstraction penalty.  The default value is 10.

     'max-early-inliner-iterations'
     'max-early-inliner-iterations'
          Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically
          bounds the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner
          can resolve.  Deeper chains are still handled by late
          inlining.

     'comdat-sharing-probability'
     'comdat-sharing-probability'
          Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with comdat
          visibility are shared across multiple compilation units.  The
          default value is 20.

     'min-vect-loop-bound'
          The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not
          vectorized when '-ftree-vectorize' is used.  The number of
          iterations after vectorization needs to be greater than the
          value specified by this option to allow vectorization.  The
          default value is 0.

     'gcse-cost-distance-ratio'
          Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an
          expression can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is
          currently supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The
          bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting is with
          simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost less
          than 'gcse-unrestricted-cost'.  Specifying 0 disables hoisting
          of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.

     'gcse-unrestricted-cost'
          Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
          instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not constrain the
          distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
          supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the
          cost, the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0
          allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.  The
          default value is 3.

     'max-hoist-depth'
          The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to
          hoist.  This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting
          algorithm.  The value of 0 does not limit on the search, but
          may slow down compilation of huge functions.  The default
          value is 30.

     'max-tail-merge-comparisons'
          The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.  This
          is used to avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.  The
          default value is 10.

     'max-tail-merge-iterations'
          The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the
          function.  This is used to limit compilation time in tree tail
          merging.  The default value is 2.

     'max-unrolled-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be
          unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also
          determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

     'max-average-unrolled-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities of
          their execution that a loop may have to be unrolled.  If a
          loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines how many
          times the loop code is unrolled.

     'max-unroll-times'
          The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

     'max-peeled-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to be
          peeled.  If a loop is peeled, this parameter also determines
          how many times the loop code is peeled.

     'max-peel-times'
          The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

     'max-peel-branches'
          The maximum number of branches on the hot path through the
          peeled sequence.

     'max-completely-peeled-insns'
          The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

     'max-completely-peel-times'
          The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable for
          complete peeling.

          The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete
          peeling.

          The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.

     'max-unswitch-level'
          The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single loop.

          invariant motion.

     'iv-consider-all-candidates-bound'
          Bound on number of candidates for induction variables, below
          which all candidates are considered for each use in induction
          variable optimizations.  If there are more candidates than
          this, only the most relevant ones are considered to avoid
          quadratic time complexity.

     'iv-max-considered-uses'
          The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that
          contain more induction variable uses.

     'iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound'
          If the number of candidates in the set is smaller than this
          value, always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set when
          adding a new one.

     'scev-max-expr-size'
          Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions
          analyzer.  Large expressions slow the analyzer.

     'scev-max-expr-complexity'
          Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar
          evolutions analyzer.  Complex expressions slow the analyzer.

     'omega-max-vars'
          The maximum number of variables in an Omega constraint system.
          The default value is 128.

     'omega-max-geqs'
          The maximum number of inequalities in an Omega constraint
          system.  The default value is 256.

     'omega-max-eqs'
          The maximum number of equalities in an Omega constraint
          system.  The default value is 128.

     'omega-max-wild-cards'
          The maximum number of wildcard variables that the Omega solver
          is able to insert.  The default value is 18.

     'omega-hash-table-size'
          The size of the hash table in the Omega solver.  The default
          value is 550.

     'omega-max-keys'
          The maximal number of keys used by the Omega solver.  The
          default value is 500.

     'omega-eliminate-redundant-constraints'
          When set to 1, use expensive methods to eliminate all
          redundant constraints.  The default value is 0.

     'vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks'
          The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed
          when doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.

     'vect-max-version-for-alias-checks'
          The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed
          when doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.

     'vect-max-peeling-for-alignment'
          The maximum number of loop peels to enhance access alignment
          for vectorizer.  Value -1 means 'no limit'.

     'max-iterations-to-track'
          The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute-force
          algorithm for analysis of the number of iterations of the loop
          tries to evaluate.

     'hot-bb-count-ws-permille'
          A basic block profile count is considered hot if it
          contributes to the given permillage (i.e.  0...1000) of the
          entire profiled execution.

     'hot-bb-frequency-fraction'
          Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions of
          basic block in function given basic block needs to have to be
          considered hot.

     'max-predicted-iterations'
          The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.
          This is useful in cases where a function contains a single
          loop with known bound and another loop with unknown bound.
          The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
          the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This
          means that the loop without bounds appears artificially cold
          relative to the other one.

     'builtin-expect-probability'
          Control the probability of the expression having the specified
          value.  This parameter takes a percentage (i.e.  0 ...  100)
          as input.  The default probability of 90 is obtained
          empirically.

     'align-threshold'

          Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of a
          basic block in a function to align the basic block.

     'align-loop-iterations'

          A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number of
          iterations is aligned.

     'tracer-dynamic-coverage'
     'tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback'

          This value is used to limit superblock formation once the
          given percentage of executed instructions is covered.  This
          limits unnecessary code size expansion.

          The 'tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback' is used only when
          profile feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed
          to statically estimated ones) are much less balanced allowing
          the threshold to be larger value.

     'tracer-max-code-growth'
          Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given
          percentage.  This is a rather artificial limit, as most of the
          duplicates are eliminated later in cross jumping, so it may be
          set to much higher values than is the desired code growth.

     'tracer-min-branch-ratio'

          Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge
          is less than this threshold (in percent).

     'tracer-min-branch-ratio'
     'tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback'

          Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower
          than this threshold.

          Similarly to 'tracer-dynamic-coverage' two values are present,
          one for compilation for profile feedback and one for
          compilation without.  The value for compilation with profile
          feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in order to
          make tracer effective.

     'max-cse-path-length'

          The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE considers.
          The default is 10.

     'max-cse-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before
          flushing.  The default is 1000.

     'ggc-min-expand'

          GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory
          allocation.  This parameter specifies the minimum percentage
          by which the garbage collector's heap should be allowed to
          expand between collections.  Tuning this may improve
          compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.

          The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of
          100% when RAM >= 1GB.  If 'getrlimit' is available, the notion
          of "RAM" is the smallest of actual RAM and 'RLIMIT_DATA' or
          'RLIMIT_AS'.  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
          particular platform, the lower bound of 30% is used.  Setting
          this parameter and 'ggc-min-heapsize' to zero causes a full
          collection to occur at every opportunity.  This is extremely
          slow, but can be useful for debugging.

     'ggc-min-heapsize'

          Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins
          bothering to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs
          after the heap expands by 'ggc-min-expand'% beyond
          'ggc-min-heapsize'.  Again, tuning this may improve
          compilation speed, and has no effect on code generation.

          The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit
          that tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not
          exceeded, but with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and
          an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able
          to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound is
          used.  Setting this parameter very large effectively disables
          garbage collection.  Setting this parameter and
          'ggc-min-expand' to zero causes a full collection to occur at
          every opportunity.

     'max-reload-search-insns'
          The maximum number of instruction reload should look backward
          for equivalent register.  Increasing values mean more
          aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase
          with probably slightly better performance.  The default value
          is 100.

     'max-cselib-memory-locations'
          The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take into
          account.  Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization,
          making the compilation time increase with probably slightly
          better performance.  The default value is 500.

     'reorder-blocks-duplicate'
     'reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback'

          Used by the basic block reordering pass to decide whether to
          use unconditional branch or duplicate the code on its
          destination.  Code is duplicated when its estimated size is
          smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
          unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.

          The 'reorder-block-duplicate-feedback' is used only when
          profile feedback is available.  It may be set to higher values
          than 'reorder-block-duplicate' since information about the hot
          spots is more accurate.

     'max-sched-ready-insns'
          The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the
          scheduler should consider at any given time during the first
          scheduling pass.  Increasing values mean more thorough
          searches, making the compilation time increase with probably
          little benefit.  The default value is 100.

     'max-sched-region-blocks'
          The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
          interblock scheduling.  The default value is 10.

     'max-pipeline-region-blocks'
          The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered for
          pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is
          15.

     'max-sched-region-insns'
          The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
          interblock scheduling.  The default value is 100.

     'max-pipeline-region-insns'
          The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
          pipelining in the selective scheduler.  The default value is
          200.

     'min-spec-prob'
          The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source
          block for interblock speculative scheduling.  The default
          value is 40.

     'max-sched-extend-regions-iters'
          The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend
          regions.  A value of 0 (the default) disables region
          extensions.

     'max-sched-insn-conflict-delay'
          The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for
          speculative motion.  The default value is 3.

     'sched-spec-prob-cutoff'
          The minimal probability of speculation success (in percents),
          so that speculative insns are scheduled.  The default value is
          40.

     'sched-spec-state-edge-prob-cutoff'
          The minimum probability an edge must have for the scheduler to
          save its state across it.  The default value is 10.

     'sched-mem-true-dep-cost'
          Minimal distance (in CPU cycles) between store and load
          targeting same memory locations.  The default value is 1.

     'selsched-max-lookahead'
          The maximum size of the lookahead window of selective
          scheduling.  It is a depth of search for available
          instructions.  The default value is 50.

     'selsched-max-sched-times'
          The maximum number of times that an instruction is scheduled
          during selective scheduling.  This is the limit on the number
          of iterations through which the instruction may be pipelined.
          The default value is 2.

     'selsched-max-insns-to-rename'
          The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list that
          are considered for renaming in the selective scheduler.  The
          default value is 2.

     'sms-min-sc'
          The minimum value of stage count that swing modulo scheduler
          generates.  The default value is 2.

     'max-last-value-rtl'
          The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be
          recorded in an expression in combiner for a pseudo register as
          last known value of that register.  The default is 10000.

     'integer-share-limit'
          Small integer constants can use a shared data structure,
          reducing the compiler's memory usage and increasing its speed.
          This sets the maximum value of a shared integer constant.  The
          default value is 256.

     'ssp-buffer-size'
          The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive stack
          smashing protection when '-fstack-protection' is used.

     'min-size-for-stack-sharing'
          The minimum size of variables taking part in stack slot
          sharing when not optimizing.  The default value is 32.

     'max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts'
          Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to
          be duplicated when threading jumps.

     'max-fields-for-field-sensitive'
          Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in a field
          sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default is zero
          for '-O0' and '-O1', and 100 for '-Os', '-O2', and '-O3'.

     'prefetch-latency'
          Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed
          before prefetch finishes.  The distance prefetched ahead is
          proportional to this constant.  Increasing this number may
          also lead to less streams being prefetched (see
          'simultaneous-prefetches').

     'simultaneous-prefetches'
          Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.

     'l1-cache-line-size'
          The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.

     'l1-cache-size'
          The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.

     'l2-cache-size'
          The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.

     'min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio'
          The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
          number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.

     'prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio'
          The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
          number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.

     'use-canonical-types'
          Whether the compiler should use the "canonical" type system.
          By default, this should always be 1, which uses a more
          efficient internal mechanism for comparing types in C++ and
          Objective-C++.  However, if bugs in the canonical type system
          are causing compilation failures, set this value to 0 to
          disable canonical types.

     'switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio'
          Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that
          are bigger than 'switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio' times the
          number of branches in the switch.

     'max-partial-antic-length'
          Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the
          tree partial redundancy elimination optimization
          ('-ftree-pre') when optimizing at '-O3' and above.  For some
          sorts of source code the enhanced partial redundancy
          elimination optimization can run away, consuming all of the
          memory available on the host machine.  This parameter sets a
          limit on the length of the sets that are computed, which
          prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for this
          parameter allows an unlimited set length.

     'sccvn-max-scc-size'
          Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during
          SCCVN processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for
          the whole function is not done and optimizations depending on
          it are disabled.  The default maximum SCC size is 10000.

     'sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access'
          Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking
          for redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit
          the search is aborted and the load or store is not considered
          redundant.  The number of queries is algorithmically limited
          to the number of stores on all paths from the load to the
          function entry.  The default maxmimum number of queries is
          1000.

     'ira-max-loops-num'
          IRA uses regional register allocation by default.  If a
          function contains more loops than the number given by this
          parameter, only at most the given number of the most
          frequently-executed loops form regions for regional register
          allocation.  The default value of the parameter is 100.

     'ira-max-conflict-table-size'
          Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the
          conflict table, the table can still require excessive amounts
          of memory for huge functions.  If the conflict table for a
          function could be more than the size in MB given by this
          parameter, the register allocator instead uses a faster,
          simpler, and lower-quality algorithm that does not require
          building a pseudo-register conflict table.  The default value
          of the parameter is 2000.

     'ira-loop-reserved-regs'
          IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in
          loops for decisions to move loop invariants (see '-O3').  The
          number of available registers reserved for some other purposes
          is given by this parameter.  The default value of the
          parameter is 2, which is the minimal number of registers
          needed by typical instructions.  This value is the best found
          from numerous experiments.

     'loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop'
          Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in
          compilation time and in amount of needed compile-time memory,
          with very large loops.  Loops with more basic blocks than this
          parameter won't have loop invariant motion optimization
          performed on them.  The default value of the parameter is 1000
          for '-O1' and 10000 for '-O2' and above.

     'loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps'
          Building data dapendencies is expensive for very large loops.
          This parameter limits the number of data references in loops
          that are considered for data dependence analysis.  These large
          loops are no handled by the optimizations using loop data
          dependencies.  The default value is 1000.

     'max-vartrack-size'
          Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during
          variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this
          limit is exceeded with variable tracking at assignments
          enabled, analysis for that function is retried without it,
          after removing all debug insns from the function.  If the
          limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var tracking
          analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting the
          parameter to zero makes it unlimited.

     'max-vartrack-expr-depth'
          Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to
          map variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.
          This trades compilation time for more complete debug
          information.  If this is set too low, value expressions that
          are available and could be represented in debug information
          may end up not being used; setting this higher may enable the
          compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
          time and memory use may grow.  The default is 12.

     'min-nondebug-insn-uid'
          Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The
          range below the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug
          insns created by '-fvar-tracking-assignments', but debug insns
          may get (non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range
          is exhausted.

     'ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor'
          IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more
          new parameters only when their cumulative size is less or
          equal to 'ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor' times the size of the
          original pointer parameter.

     'tm-max-aggregate-size'
          When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction,
          this parameter specifies the size in bytes after which
          variables are saved with the logging functions as opposed to
          save/restore code sequence pairs.  This option only applies
          when using '-fgnu-tm'.

     'graphite-max-nb-scop-params'
          To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms,
          the number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is
          bounded.  The default value is 10 parameters.  A variable
          whose value is unknown at compilation time and defined outside
          a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.

     'graphite-max-bbs-per-function'
          To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the
          size of the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The
          default value is 100 basic blocks.

     'loop-block-tile-size'
          Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
          '-floop-block' or '-floop-strip-mine', strip mine each loop in
          the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
          length can be changed using the 'loop-block-tile-size'
          parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.

     'ipa-cp-value-list-size'
          IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed
          to a function's parameter in order to propagate them and
          perform devirtualization.  'ipa-cp-value-list-size' is the
          maximum number of values and types it stores per one formal
          parameter of a function.

     'ipa-cp-eval-threshold'
          IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability
          heuristics and performs those cloning opportunities with
          scores that exceed 'ipa-cp-eval-threshold'.

     'ipa-max-agg-items'
          IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values
          passed in an aggregate.  'ipa-max-agg-items' controls the
          maximum number of such values per one parameter.

     'ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus'
          When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the
          number of iterations of a loop known, it adds a bonus of
          'ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus' bonus to the profitability score of
          the candidate.

     'ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus'
          When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the
          index of an array access known, it adds a bonus of
          'ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus' bonus to the profitability
          score of the candidate.

     'lto-partitions'
          Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR
          compilation.  The number of partitions should exceed the
          number of CPUs used for compilation.  The default value is 32.

     'lto-minpartition'
          Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated
          instructions).  This prevents expenses of splitting very small
          programs into too many partitions.

     'cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help'
          The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions
          when C++ name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is
          1000.

     'sink-frequency-threshold'
          The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the
          target block relative to a statement's original block to allow
          statement sinking of a statement.  Larger numbers result in
          more aggressive statement sinking.  The default value is 75.
          A small positive adjustment is applied for statements with
          memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.

     'max-stores-to-sink'
          The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be
          sunk.  Set to 0 if either vectorization ('-ftree-vectorize')
          or if-conversion ('-ftree-loop-if-convert') is disabled.  The
          default is 2.

     'allow-load-data-races'
          Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on loads.  Set to
          1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
          unless implicitly set by the '-fmemory-model=' option.

     'allow-store-data-races'
          Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores.  Set
          to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by
          default unless implicitly set by the '-fmemory-model=' option.

     'allow-packed-load-data-races'
          Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data
          loads.  Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is
          enabled by default unless implicitly set by the
          '-fmemory-model=' option.

     'allow-packed-store-data-races'
          Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data
          stores.  Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is
          enabled by default unless implicitly set by the
          '-fmemory-model=' option.

     'case-values-threshold'
          The smallest number of different values for which it is best
          to use a jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.
          If the value is 0, use the default for the machine.  The
          default is 0.

     'tree-reassoc-width'
          Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel in
          reassociated tree.  This parameter overrides target dependent
          heuristics used by default if has non zero value.

     'sched-pressure-algorithm'
          Choose between the two available implementations of
          '-fsched-pressure'.  Algorithm 1 is the original
          implementation and is the more likely to prevent instructions
          from being reordered.  Algorithm 2 was designed to be a
          compromise between the relatively conservative approach taken
          by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive approach taken by the
          default scheduler.  It relies more heavily on having a regular
          register file and accurate register pressure classes.  See
          'haifa-sched.c' in the GCC sources for more details.

          The default choice depends on the target.

     'max-slsr-cand-scan'
          Set the maximum number of existing candidates that will be
          considered when seeking a basis for a new straight-line
          strength reduction candidate.

     'asan-globals'
          Enable buffer overflow detection for global objects.  This
          kind of protection is enabled by default if you are using
          '-fsanitize=address' option.  To disable global objects
          protection use '--param asan-globals=0'.

     'asan-stack'
          Enable buffer overflow detection for stack objects.  This kind
          of protection is enabled by default when
          using'-fsanitize=address'.  To disable stack protection use
          '--param asan-stack=0' option.

     'asan-instrument-reads'
          Enable buffer overflow detection for memory reads.  This kind
          of protection is enabled by default when using
          '-fsanitize=address'.  To disable memory reads protection use
          '--param asan-instrument-reads=0'.

     'asan-instrument-writes'
          Enable buffer overflow detection for memory writes.  This kind
          of protection is enabled by default when using
          '-fsanitize=address'.  To disable memory writes protection use
          '--param asan-instrument-writes=0' option.

     'asan-memintrin'
          Enable detection for built-in functions.  This kind of
          protection is enabled by default when using
          '-fsanitize=address'.  To disable built-in functions
          protection use '--param asan-memintrin=0'.

     'asan-use-after-return'
          Enable detection of use-after-return.  This kind of protection
          is enabled by default when using '-fsanitize=address' option.
          To disable use-after-return detection use '--param
          asan-use-after-return=0'.

     'asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold'
          If number of memory accesses in function being instrumented is
          greater or equal to this number, use callbacks instead of
          inline checks.  E.g.  to disable inline code use '--param
          asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold=0'.

3.11 Options Controlling the Preprocessor
=========================================

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

 If you use the '-E' option, nothing is done except preprocessing.  Some
of these options make sense only together with '-E' because they cause
the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.

'-Wp,OPTION'
     You can use '-Wp,OPTION' to bypass the compiler driver and pass
     OPTION directly through to the preprocessor.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  However,
     many options are modified, translated or interpreted by the
     compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and '-Wp'
     forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct interface
     is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you
     should avoid using '-Wp' and let the driver handle the options
     instead.

'-Xpreprocessor OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC does not
     recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
     '-Xpreprocessor' twice, once for the option and once for the
     argument.

'-no-integrated-cpp'
     Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.  By
     default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part of input
     tokenization and parsing.  If this option is provided, the
     appropriate language front end ('cc1', 'cc1plus', or 'cc1obj' for
     C, C++, and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
     once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation of the
     preprocessed input.  This option may be useful in conjunction with
     the '-B' or '-wrapper' options to specify an alternate preprocessor
     or perform additional processing of the program source between
     normal preprocessing and compilation.

'-D NAME'
     Predefine NAME as a macro, with definition '1'.

'-D NAME=DEFINITION'
     The contents of DEFINITION are tokenized and processed as if they
     appeared during translation phase three in a '#define' directive.
     In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline
     characters.

     If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
     program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
     characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

     If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line,
     write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the
     equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells,
     so you will need to quote the option.  With 'sh' and 'csh',
     '-D'NAME(ARGS...)=DEFINITION'' works.

     '-D' and '-U' options are processed in the order they are given on
     the command line.  All '-imacros FILE' and '-include FILE' options
     are processed after all '-D' and '-U' options.

'-U NAME'
     Cancel any previous definition of NAME, either built in or provided
     with a '-D' option.

'-undef'
     Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
     standard predefined macros remain defined.

'-I DIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
     header files.  Directories named by '-I' are searched before the
     standard system include directories.  If the directory DIR is a
     standard system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure
     that the default search order for system directories and the
     special treatment of system headers are not defeated .  If DIR
     begins with '=', then the '=' will be replaced by the sysroot
     prefix; see '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-o FILE'
     Write output to FILE.  This is the same as specifying FILE as the
     second non-option argument to 'cpp'.  'gcc' has a different
     interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must use
     '-o' to specify the output file.

'-Wall'
     Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
     At present this is '-Wcomment', '-Wtrigraphs', '-Wmultichar' and a
     warning about integer promotion causing a change of sign in '#if'
     expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on
     by default and have no options to control them.

'-Wcomment'
'-Wcomments'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence '/*' appears in a '/*'
     comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a '//' comment.
     (Both forms have the same effect.)

'-Wtrigraphs'
     Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the
     program.  However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline
     ('??/' at the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment
     begins or ends.  Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped
     newlines produce warnings inside a comment.

     This option is implied by '-Wall'.  If '-Wall' is not given, this
     option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get
     trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other '-Wall'
     warnings, use '-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs'.

'-Wtraditional'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have
     no traditional C equivalent, and problematic constructs which
     should be avoided.

'-Wundef'
     Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in
     an '#if' directive, outside of 'defined'.  Such identifiers are
     replaced with zero.

'-Wunused-macros'
     Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A
     macro is "used" if it is expanded or tested for existence at least
     once.  The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been
     used at the time it is redefined or undefined.

     Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
     defined in include files are not warned about.

     _Note:_ If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
     conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid
     the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the
     macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first
     skipped block.  Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with
     something like:

          #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
          #endif

'-Wendif-labels'
     Warn whenever an '#else' or an '#endif' are followed by text.  This
     usually happens in code of the form

          #if FOO
          ...
          #else FOO
          ...
          #endif FOO

     The second and third 'FOO' should be in comments, but often are not
     in older programs.  This warning is on by default.

'-Werror'
     Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers
     warnings will be rejected.

'-Wsystem-headers'
     Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally
     unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.
     If you are responsible for the system library, you may want to see
     them.

'-w'
     Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by
     default.

'-pedantic'
     Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some
     of them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on
     harmless code.

'-pedantic-errors'
     Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory
     diagnostics into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that
     GCC issues without '-pedantic' but treats as warnings.

'-M'
     Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
     suitable for 'make' describing the dependencies of the main source
     file.  The preprocessor outputs one 'make' rule containing the
     object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of
     all the included files, including those coming from '-include' or
     '-imacros' command line options.

     Unless specified explicitly (with '-MT' or '-MQ'), the object file
     name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix
     replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
     parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
     split into several lines using '\'-newline.  The rule has no
     commands.

     This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such
     as '-dM'.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
     rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
     '-MF', or use an environment variable like 'DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT'
     (*note Environment Variables::).  Debug output will still be sent
     to the regular output stream as normal.

     Passing '-M' to the driver implies '-E', and suppresses warnings
     with an implicit '-w'.

'-MM'
     Like '-M' but do not mention header files that are found in system
     header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or
     indirectly, from such a header.

     This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in
     an '#include' directive does not in itself determine whether that
     header will appear in '-MM' dependency output.  This is a slight
     change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

'-MF FILE'
     When used with '-M' or '-MM', specifies a file to write the
     dependencies to.  If no '-MF' switch is given the preprocessor
     sends the rules to the same place it would have sent preprocessed
     output.

     When used with the driver options '-MD' or '-MMD', '-MF' overrides
     the default dependency output file.

'-MG'
     In conjunction with an option such as '-M' requesting dependency
     generation, '-MG' assumes missing header files are generated files
     and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error.  The
     dependency filename is taken directly from the '#include' directive
     without prepending any path.  '-MG' also suppresses preprocessed
     output, as a missing header file renders this useless.

     This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

'-MP'
     This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
     other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
     dummy rules work around errors 'make' gives if you remove header
     files without updating the 'Makefile' to match.

     This is typical output:

          test.o: test.c test.h

          test.h:

'-MT TARGET'

     Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
     default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
     directory components and any file suffix such as '.c', and appends
     the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

     An '-MT' option will set the target to be exactly the string you
     specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a
     single argument to '-MT', or use multiple '-MT' options.

     For example, '-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'' might give

          $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

'-MQ TARGET'

     Same as '-MT', but it quotes any characters which are special to
     Make.  '-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'' gives

          $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

     The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given
     with '-MQ'.

'-MD'
     '-MD' is equivalent to '-M -MF FILE', except that '-E' is not
     implied.  The driver determines FILE based on whether an '-o'
     option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a
     suffix of '.d', otherwise it takes the name of the input file,
     removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a '.d'
     suffix.

     If '-MD' is used in conjunction with '-E', any '-o' switch is
     understood to specify the dependency output file (*note -MF:
     dashMF.), but if used without '-E', each '-o' is understood to
     specify a target object file.

     Since '-E' is not implied, '-MD' can be used to generate a
     dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

'-MMD'
     Like '-MD' except mention only user header files, not system header
     files.

'-fpch-deps'
     When using precompiled headers (*note Precompiled Headers::), this
     flag will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files
     from the precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only
     the precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were
     used to create it because those files are not consulted when a
     precompiled header is used.

'-fpch-preprocess'
     This option allows use of a precompiled header (*note Precompiled
     Headers::) together with '-E'.  It inserts a special '#pragma',
     '#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "FILENAME"' in the output to mark the
     place where the precompiled header was found, and its FILENAME.
     When '-fpreprocessed' is in use, GCC recognizes this '#pragma' and
     loads the PCH.

     This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed
     output is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on
     by '-save-temps'.

     You should not write this '#pragma' in your own code, but it is
     safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a
     different location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be
     relative to GCC's current directory.

'-x c'
'-x c++'
'-x objective-c'
'-x assembler-with-cpp'
     Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.
     This has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it
     merely selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of
     these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension of
     the source file: '.c', '.cc', '.m', or '.S'.  Some other common
     extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does
     not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is
     the most generic mode.

     _Note:_ Previous versions of cpp accepted a '-lang' option which
     selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
     This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the '-l'
     option.

'-std=STANDARD'
'-ansi'
     Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently
     CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be added in the
     future.

     STANDARD may be one of:
     'c90'
     'c89'
     'iso9899:1990'
          The ISO C standard from 1990.  'c90' is the customary
          shorthand for this version of the standard.

          The '-ansi' option is equivalent to '-std=c90'.

     'iso9899:199409'
          The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.

     'iso9899:1999'
     'c99'
     'iso9899:199x'
     'c9x'
          The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.
          Before publication, this was known as C9X.

     'iso9899:2011'
     'c11'
     'c1x'
          The revised ISO C standard, published in December 2011.
          Before publication, this was known as C1X.

     'gnu90'
     'gnu89'
          The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.

     'gnu99'
     'gnu9x'
          The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.

     'gnu11'
     'gnu1x'
          The 2011 C standard plus GNU extensions.

     'c++98'
          The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

     'gnu++98'
          The same as '-std=c++98' plus GNU extensions.  This is the
          default for C++ code.

'-I-'
     Split the include path.  Any directories specified with '-I'
     options before '-I-' are searched only for headers requested with
     '#include "FILE"'; they are not searched for '#include <FILE>'.  If
     additional directories are specified with '-I' options after the
     '-I-', those directories are searched for all '#include'
     directives.

     In addition, '-I-' inhibits the use of the directory of the current
     file directory as the first search directory for '#include "FILE"'.
     This option has been deprecated.

'-nostdinc'
     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
     Only the directories you have specified with '-I' options (and the
     directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

'-nostdinc++'
     Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
     directories, but do still search the other standard directories.
     (This option is used when building the C++ library.)

'-include FILE'
     Process FILE as if '#include "file"' appeared as the first line of
     the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched for
     FILE is the preprocessor's working directory _instead of_ the
     directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
     is searched for in the remainder of the '#include "..."' search
     chain as normal.

     If multiple '-include' options are given, the files are included in
     the order they appear on the command line.

'-imacros FILE'
     Exactly like '-include', except that any output produced by
     scanning FILE is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
     This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without
     also processing its declarations.

     All files specified by '-imacros' are processed before all files
     specified by '-include'.

'-idirafter DIR'
     Search DIR for header files, but do it _after_ all directories
     specified with '-I' and the standard system directories have been
     exhausted.  DIR is treated as a system include directory.  If DIR
     begins with '=', then the '=' will be replaced by the sysroot
     prefix; see '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-iprefix PREFIX'
     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent '-iwithprefix' options.
     If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the final
     '/'.

'-iwithprefix DIR'
'-iwithprefixbefore DIR'
     Append DIR to the prefix specified previously with '-iprefix', and
     add the resulting directory to the include search path.
     '-iwithprefixbefore' puts it in the same place '-I' would;
     '-iwithprefix' puts it where '-idirafter' would.

'-isysroot DIR'
     This option is like the '--sysroot' option, but applies only to
     header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both
     header files and libraries).  See the '--sysroot' option for more
     information.

'-imultilib DIR'
     Use DIR as a subdirectory of the directory containing
     target-specific C++ headers.

'-isystem DIR'
     Search DIR for header files, after all directories specified by
     '-I' but before the standard system directories.  Mark it as a
     system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is
     applied to the standard system directories.  If DIR begins with
     '=', then the '=' will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
     '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-iquote DIR'
     Search DIR only for header files requested with '#include "FILE"';
     they are not searched for '#include <FILE>', before all directories
     specified by '-I' and before the standard system directories.  If
     DIR begins with '=', then the '=' will be replaced by the sysroot
     prefix; see '--sysroot' and '-isysroot'.

'-fdirectives-only'
     When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

     The option's behavior depends on the '-E' and '-fpreprocessed'
     options.

     With '-E', preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
     such as '#define', '#ifdef', and '#error'.  Other preprocessor
     operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
     performed.  In addition, the '-dD' option is implicitly enabled.

     With '-fpreprocessed', predefinition of command line and most
     builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as '__LINE__', which are
     contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables
     compilation of files previously preprocessed with '-E
     -fdirectives-only'.

     With both '-E' and '-fpreprocessed', the rules for '-fpreprocessed'
     take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files
     previously preprocessed with '-E -fdirectives-only'.

'-fdollars-in-identifiers'
     Accept '$' in identifiers.

'-fextended-identifiers'
     Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
     experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by
     default for C99 and C++.

'-fno-canonical-system-headers'
     When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with
     canonicalization.

'-fpreprocessed'
     Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
     preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion,
     trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of
     most directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes
     comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with '-C' to the
     compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated
     preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.

     '-fpreprocessed' is implicit if the input file has one of the
     extensions '.i', '.ii' or '.mi'.  These are the extensions that GCC
     uses for preprocessed files created by '-save-temps'.

'-ftabstop=WIDTH'
     Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor
     report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs
     appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than
     100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.

'-fdebug-cpp'
     This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used with '-E',
     dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every token in
     the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location belongs
     to.  The dump of the map holding the location of a token would be:
          {'P':/file/path;'F':/includer/path;'L':LINE_NUM;'C':COL_NUM;'S':SYSTEM_HEADER_P;'M':MAP_ADDRESS;'E':MACRO_EXPANSION_P,'loc':LOCATION}

     When used without '-E', this option has no effect.

'-ftrack-macro-expansion[=LEVEL]'
     Track locations of tokens across macro expansions.  This allows the
     compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
     when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion.  Using this
     option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory.
     The LEVEL parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of
     token location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
     necessary.  Value '0' of LEVEL de-activates this option just as if
     no '-ftrack-macro-expansion' was present on the command line.
     Value '1' tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake
     of minimal memory overhead.  In this mode all tokens resulting from
     the expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the same
     location.  Value '2' tracks tokens locations completely.  This
     value is the most memory hungry.  When this option is given no
     argument, the default parameter value is '2'.

     Note that -ftrack-macro-expansion=2 is activated by default.

'-fexec-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the execution character set, used for string and character
     constants.  The default is UTF-8.  CHARSET can be any encoding
     supported by the system's 'iconv' library routine.

'-fwide-exec-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
     character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
     corresponds to the width of 'wchar_t'.  As with '-fexec-charset',
     CHARSET can be any encoding supported by the system's 'iconv'
     library routine; however, you will have problems with encodings
     that do not fit exactly in 'wchar_t'.

'-finput-charset=CHARSET'
     Set the input character set, used for translation from the
     character set of the input file to the source character set used by
     GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this
     information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be
     overridden by either the locale or this command line option.
     Currently the command line option takes precedence if there's a
     conflict.  CHARSET can be any encoding supported by the system's
     'iconv' library routine.

'-fworking-directory'
     Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
     will let the compiler know the current working directory at the
     time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the
     preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second
     linemarker with the current working directory followed by two
     slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it's present in the
     preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working
     directory in some debugging information formats.  This option is
     implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this
     can be inhibited with the negated form '-fno-working-directory'.
     If the '-P' flag is present in the command line, this option has no
     effect, since no '#line' directives are emitted whatsoever.

'-fno-show-column'
     Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary
     if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not
     understand the column numbers, such as 'dejagnu'.

'-A PREDICATE=ANSWER'
     Make an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.
     This form is preferred to the older form '-A PREDICATE(ANSWER)',
     which is still supported, because it does not use shell special
     characters.

'-A -PREDICATE=ANSWER'
     Cancel an assertion with the predicate PREDICATE and answer ANSWER.

'-dCHARS'
     CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and
     must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted
     by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and
     so are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior
     conflicts, the result is undefined.

     'M'
          Instead of the normal output, generate a list of '#define'
          directives for all the macros defined during the execution of
          the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you
          a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the
          preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file 'foo.h', the command

               touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

          will show all the predefined macros.

          If you use '-dM' without the '-E' option, '-dM' is interpreted
          as a synonym for '-fdump-rtl-mach'.  *Note (gcc)Debugging
          Options::.

     'D'
          Like 'M' except in two respects: it does _not_ include the
          predefined macros, and it outputs _both_ the '#define'
          directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of
          output go to the standard output file.

     'N'
          Like 'D', but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

     'I'
          Output '#include' directives in addition to the result of
          preprocessing.

     'U'
          Like 'D' except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
          definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output;
          the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
          '#undef' directives are also output for macros tested but
          undefined at the time.

'-P'
     Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the
     preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the preprocessor
     on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program
     which might be confused by the linemarkers.

'-C'
     Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the
     output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are
     deleted along with the directive.

     You should be prepared for side effects when using '-C'; it causes
     the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
     For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
     directive line have the effect of turning that line into an
     ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no
     longer a '#'.

'-CC'
     Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
     like '-C', except that comments contained within macros are also
     passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

     In addition to the side-effects of the '-C' option, the '-CC'
     option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted
     to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use of that macro
     from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.

     The '-CC' option is generally used to support lint comments.

'-traditional-cpp'
     Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as
     opposed to ISO C preprocessors.

'-trigraphs'
     Process trigraph sequences.  These are three-character sequences,
     all starting with '??', that are defined by ISO C to stand for
     single characters.  For example, '??/' stands for '\', so ''??/n''
     is a character constant for a newline.  By default, GCC ignores
     trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See
     the '-std' and '-ansi' options.

     The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

          Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
          Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

'-remap'
     Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit
     very short file names, such as MS-DOS.

'--help'
'--target-help'
     Print text describing all the command line options instead of
     preprocessing anything.

'-v'
     Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP's version number at the beginning
     of execution, and report the final form of the include path.

'-H'
     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
     normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
     '#include' stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also printed,
     even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header
     file is printed with '...x' and a valid one with '...!' .

'-version'
'--version'
     Print out GNU CPP's version number.  With one dash, proceed to
     preprocess as normal.  With two dashes, exit immediately.

3.12 Passing Options to the Assembler
=====================================

You can pass options to the assembler.

'-Wa,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

'-Xassembler OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific assembler options that GCC does not
     recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
     '-Xassembler' twice, once for the option and once for the argument.

3.13 Options for Linking
========================

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is not
doing a link step.

'OBJECT-FILE-NAME'
     A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
     considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
     distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
     contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as
     input to the linker.

'-c'
'-S'
'-E'
     If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
     object file names should not be used as arguments.  *Note Overall
     Options::.

'-lLIBRARY'
'-l LIBRARY'
     Search the library named LIBRARY when linking.  (The second
     alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
     POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

     It makes a difference where in the command you write this option;
     the linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the
     order they are specified.  Thus, 'foo.o -lz bar.o' searches library
     'z' after file 'foo.o' but before 'bar.o'.  If 'bar.o' refers to
     functions in 'z', those functions may not be loaded.

     The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
     which is actually a file named 'libLIBRARY.a'.  The linker then
     uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

     The directories searched include several standard system
     directories plus any that you specify with '-L'.

     Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
     whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file
     by scanning through it for members which define symbols that have
     so far been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is
     found is an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual
     fashion.  The only difference between using an '-l' option and
     specifying a file name is that '-l' surrounds LIBRARY with 'lib'
     and '.a' and searches several directories.

'-lobjc'
     You need this special case of the '-l' option in order to link an
     Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.

'-nostartfiles'
     Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The
     standard system libraries are used normally, unless '-nostdlib' or
     '-nodefaultlibs' is used.

'-nodefaultlibs'
     Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the
     libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
     specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
     '-static-libgcc' or '-shared-libgcc', are ignored.  The standard
     startup files are used normally, unless '-nostartfiles' is used.

     The compiler may generate calls to 'memcmp', 'memset', 'memcpy' and
     'memmove'.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in libc.
     These entry points should be supplied through some other mechanism
     when this option is specified.

'-nostdlib'
     Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when
     linking.  No startup files and only the libraries you specify are
     passed to the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system
     libraries, such as '-static-libgcc' or '-shared-libgcc', are
     ignored.

     The compiler may generate calls to 'memcmp', 'memset', 'memcpy' and
     'memmove'.  These entries are usually resolved by entries in libc.
     These entry points should be supplied through some other mechanism
     when this option is specified.

     One of the standard libraries bypassed by '-nostdlib' and
     '-nodefaultlibs' is 'libgcc.a', a library of internal subroutines
     which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or
     special needs for some languages.  (*Note Interfacing to GCC
     Output: (gccint)Interface, for more discussion of 'libgcc.a'.)  In
     most cases, you need 'libgcc.a' even when you want to avoid other
     standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify '-nostdlib'
     or '-nodefaultlibs' you should usually specify '-lgcc' as well.
     This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
     library subroutines.  (An example of such an internal subroutine is
     '__main', used to ensure C++ constructors are called; *note
     'collect2': (gccint)Collect2.)

'-pie'
     Produce a position independent executable on targets that support
     it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of
     options used for compilation ('-fpie', '-fPIE', or model
     suboptions) when you specify this linker option.

'-rdynamic'
     Pass the flag '-export-dynamic' to the ELF linker, on targets that
     support it.  This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not only
     used ones, to the dynamic symbol table.  This option is needed for
     some uses of 'dlopen' or to allow obtaining backtraces from within
     a program.

'-s'
     Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the
     executable.

'-static'
     On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with
     the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.

'-shared'
     Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects
     to form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For
     predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
     used for compilation ('-fpic', '-fPIC', or model suboptions) when
     you specify this linker option.(1)

'-shared-libgcc'
'-static-libgcc'
     On systems that provide 'libgcc' as a shared library, these options
     force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
     If no shared version of 'libgcc' was built when the compiler was
     configured, these options have no effect.

     There are several situations in which an application should use the
     shared 'libgcc' instead of the static version.  The most common of
     these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
     across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the
     libraries as well as the application itself should use the shared
     'libgcc'.

     Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
     '-shared-libgcc' whenever you build a shared library or a main
     executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use exceptions,
     so this is the right thing to do.

     If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you
     may find that they are not always linked with the shared 'libgcc'.
     If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU
     linker or a GNU linker that does not support option
     '--eh-frame-hdr', it links the shared version of 'libgcc' into
     shared libraries by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the
     linker and optimizes away the linking with the shared version of
     'libgcc', linking with the static version of libgcc by default.
     This allows exceptions to propagate through such shared libraries,
     without incurring relocation costs at library load time.

     However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or
     catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as
     appropriate for the languages used in the program, or using the
     option '-shared-libgcc', such that it is linked with the shared
     'libgcc'.

'-static-libasan'
     When the '-fsanitize=address' option is used to link a program, the
     GCC driver automatically links against 'libasan'.  If 'libasan' is
     available as a shared library, and the '-static' option is not
     used, then this links against the shared version of 'libasan'.  The
     '-static-libasan' option directs the GCC driver to link 'libasan'
     statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

'-static-libtsan'
     When the '-fsanitize=thread' option is used to link a program, the
     GCC driver automatically links against 'libtsan'.  If 'libtsan' is
     available as a shared library, and the '-static' option is not
     used, then this links against the shared version of 'libtsan'.  The
     '-static-libtsan' option directs the GCC driver to link 'libtsan'
     statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

'-static-liblsan'
     When the '-fsanitize=leak' option is used to link a program, the
     GCC driver automatically links against 'liblsan'.  If 'liblsan' is
     available as a shared library, and the '-static' option is not
     used, then this links against the shared version of 'liblsan'.  The
     '-static-liblsan' option directs the GCC driver to link 'liblsan'
     statically, without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

'-static-libubsan'
     When the '-fsanitize=undefined' option is used to link a program,
     the GCC driver automatically links against 'libubsan'.  If
     'libubsan' is available as a shared library, and the '-static'
     option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
     'libubsan'.  The '-static-libubsan' option directs the GCC driver
     to link 'libubsan' statically, without necessarily linking other
     libraries statically.

'-static-libstdc++'
     When the 'g++' program is used to link a C++ program, it normally
     automatically links against 'libstdc++'.  If 'libstdc++' is
     available as a shared library, and the '-static' option is not
     used, then this links against the shared version of 'libstdc++'.
     That is normally fine.  However, it is sometimes useful to freeze
     the version of 'libstdc++' used by the program without going all
     the way to a fully static link.  The '-static-libstdc++' option
     directs the 'g++' driver to link 'libstdc++' statically, without
     necessarily linking other libraries statically.

'-symbolic'
     Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.
     Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link
     editor option '-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs').  Only a few systems
     support this option.

'-T SCRIPT'
     Use SCRIPT as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
     systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
     targets without an operating system, the '-T' option may be
     required when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.

'-Xlinker OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  You can use this to supply
     system-specific linker options that GCC does not recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you
     must use '-Xlinker' twice, once for the option and once for the
     argument.  For example, to pass '-assert definitions', you must
     write '-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work to
     write '-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because this passes the
     entire string as a single argument, which is not what the linker
     expects.

     When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
     arguments to linker options using the 'OPTION=VALUE' syntax than as
     separate arguments.  For example, you can specify '-Xlinker
     -Map=output.map' rather than '-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map'.
     Other linkers may not support this syntax for command-line options.

'-Wl,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  If OPTION contains commas,
     it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
     syntax to pass an argument to the option.  For example,
     '-Wl,-Map,output.map' passes '-Map output.map' to the linker.  When
     using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
     '-Wl,-Map=output.map'.

'-u SYMBOL'
     Pretend the symbol SYMBOL is undefined, to force linking of library
     modules to define it.  You can use '-u' multiple times with
     different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On some systems, 'gcc -shared' needs to build supplementary stub
code for constructors to work.  On multi-libbed systems, 'gcc -shared'
must select the correct support libraries to link against.  Failing to
supply the correct flags may lead to subtle defects.  Supplying them in
cases where they are not necessary is innocuous.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Directory Options,  Next: Spec Files,  Prev: Link Options,  Up: Invoking GCC

3.14 Options for Directory Search
=================================

These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

'-IDIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
     searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system
     header file, substituting your own version, since these directories
     are searched before the system header file directories.  However,
     you should not use this option to add directories that contain
     vendor-supplied system header files (use '-isystem' for that).  If
     you use more than one '-I' option, the directories are scanned in
     left-to-right order; the standard system directories come after.

     If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified
     with '-isystem', is also specified with '-I', the '-I' option is
     ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a system directory
     at its normal position in the system include chain.  This is to
     ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and the
     ordering for the 'include_next' directive are not inadvertently
     changed.  If you really need to change the search order for system
     directories, use the '-nostdinc' and/or '-isystem' options.

'-iplugindir=DIR'
     Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed by
     '-fplugin=NAME' instead of '-fplugin=PATH/NAME.so'.  This option is
     not meant to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.

'-iquoteDIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
     searched for header files only for the case of '#include "FILE"';
     they are not searched for '#include <FILE>', otherwise just like
     '-I'.

'-LDIR'
     Add directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
     '-l'.

'-BPREFIX'
     This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
     include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

     The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
     'cpp', 'cc1', 'as' and 'ld'.  It tries PREFIX as a prefix for each
     program it tries to run, both with and without 'MACHINE/VERSION/'
     (*note Target Options::).

     For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
     '-B' prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if '-B' is not
     specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, '/usr/lib/gcc/'
     and '/usr/local/lib/gcc/'.  If neither of those results in a file
     name that is found, the unmodified program name is searched for
     using the directories specified in your 'PATH' environment
     variable.

     The compiler checks to see if the path provided by the '-B' refers
     to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory separator
     character at the end of the path.

     '-B' prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
     to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
     options into '-L' options for the linker.  They also apply to
     include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates
     these options into '-isystem' options for the preprocessor.  In
     this case, the compiler appends 'include' to the prefix.

     The runtime support file 'libgcc.a' can also be searched for using
     the '-B' prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
     standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is
     left out of the link if it is not found by those means.

     Another way to specify a prefix much like the '-B' prefix is to use
     the environment variable 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.

     As a special kludge, if the path provided by '-B' is
     '[dir/]stageN/', where N is a number in the range 0 to 9, then it
     is replaced by '[dir/]include'.  This is to help with
     boot-strapping the compiler.

'-specs=FILE'
     Process FILE after the compiler reads in the standard 'specs' file,
     in order to override the defaults which the 'gcc' driver program
     uses when determining what switches to pass to 'cc1', 'cc1plus',
     'as', 'ld', etc.  More than one '-specs=FILE' can be specified on
     the command line, and they are processed in order, from left to
     right.

'--sysroot=DIR'
     Use DIR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
     For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
     '/usr/include' and libraries in '/usr/lib', it instead searches
     'DIR/usr/include' and 'DIR/usr/lib'.

     If you use both this option and the '-isysroot' option, then the
     '--sysroot' option applies to libraries, but the '-isysroot' option
     applies to header files.

     The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary
     support for this option.  If your linker does not support this
     option, the header file aspect of '--sysroot' still works, but the
     library aspect does not.

'--no-sysroot-suffix'
     For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
     with '--sysroot', depending on the other options used, so that
     headers may for example be found in 'DIR/SUFFIX/usr/include'
     instead of 'DIR/usr/include'.  This option disables the addition of
     such a suffix.

'-I-'
     This option has been deprecated.  Please use '-iquote' instead for
     '-I' directories before the '-I-' and remove the '-I-'.  Any
     directories you specify with '-I' options before the '-I-' option
     are searched only for the case of '#include "FILE"'; they are not
     searched for '#include <FILE>'.

     If additional directories are specified with '-I' options after the
     '-I-', these directories are searched for all '#include'
     directives.  (Ordinarily _all_ '-I' directories are used this way.)

     In addition, the '-I-' option inhibits the use of the current
     directory (where the current input file came from) as the first
     search directory for '#include "FILE"'.  There is no way to
     override this effect of '-I-'.  With '-I.' you can specify
     searching the directory that is current when the compiler is
     invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor
     does by default, but it is often satisfactory.

     '-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
     for header files.  Thus, '-I-' and '-nostdinc' are independent.

3.15 Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them
=============================================================

'gcc' is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a sequence
of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and linking.
GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to deduce
which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options it ought
to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled by "spec
strings".  In most cases there is one spec string for each program that
GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec strings to control
their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can be overridden by
using the '-specs=' command-line switch to specify a spec file.

 "Spec files" are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.  The type of directive is determined by the first non-whitespace
character on the line, which can be one of the following:

'%COMMAND'
     Issues a COMMAND to the spec file processor.  The commands that can
     appear here are:

     '%include <FILE>'
          Search for FILE and insert its text at the current point in
          the specs file.

     '%include_noerr <FILE>'
          Just like '%include', but do not generate an error message if
          the include file cannot be found.

     '%rename OLD_NAME NEW_NAME'
          Rename the spec string OLD_NAME to NEW_NAME.

'*[SPEC_NAME]:'
     This tells the compiler to create, override or delete the named
     spec string.  All lines after this directive up to the next
     directive or blank line are considered to be the text for the spec
     string.  If this results in an empty string then the spec is
     deleted.  (Or, if the spec did not exist, then nothing happens.)
     Otherwise, if the spec does not currently exist a new spec is
     created.  If the spec does exist then its contents are overridden
     by the text of this directive, unless the first character of that
     text is the '+' character, in which case the text is appended to
     the spec.

'[SUFFIX]:'
     Creates a new '[SUFFIX] spec' pair.  All lines after this directive
     and up to the next directive or blank line are considered to make
     up the spec string for the indicated suffix.  When the compiler
     encounters an input file with the named suffix, it processes the
     spec string in order to work out how to compile that file.  For
     example:

          .ZZ:
          z-compile -input %i

     This says that any input file whose name ends in '.ZZ' should be
     passed to the program 'z-compile', which should be invoked with the
     command-line switch '-input' and with the result of performing the
     '%i' substitution.  (See below.)

     As an alternative to providing a spec string, the text following a
     suffix directive can be one of the following:

     '@LANGUAGE'
          This says that the suffix is an alias for a known LANGUAGE.
          This is similar to using the '-x' command-line switch to GCC
          to specify a language explicitly.  For example:

               .ZZ:
               @c++

          Says that .ZZ files are, in fact, C++ source files.

     '#NAME'
          This causes an error messages saying:

               NAME compiler not installed on this system.

     GCC already has an extensive list of suffixes built into it.  This
     directive adds an entry to the end of the list of suffixes, but
     since the list is searched from the end backwards, it is
     effectively possible to override earlier entries using this
     technique.

 GCC has the following spec strings built into it.  Spec files can
override these strings or create their own.  Note that individual
targets can also add their own spec strings to this list.

     asm          Options to pass to the assembler
     asm_final    Options to pass to the assembler post-processor
     cpp          Options to pass to the C preprocessor
     cc1          Options to pass to the C compiler
     cc1plus      Options to pass to the C++ compiler
     endfile      Object files to include at the end of the link
     link         Options to pass to the linker
     lib          Libraries to include on the command line to the linker
     libgcc       Decides which GCC support library to pass to the linker
     linker       Sets the name of the linker
     predefines   Defines to be passed to the C preprocessor
     signed_char  Defines to pass to CPP to say whether char is signed
                  by default
     startfile    Object files to include at the start of the link

 Here is a small example of a spec file:

     %rename lib                 old_lib

     *lib:
     --start-group -lgcc -lc -leval1 --end-group %(old_lib)

 This example renames the spec called 'lib' to 'old_lib' and then
overrides the previous definition of 'lib' with a new one.  The new
definition adds in some extra command-line options before including the
text of the old definition.

 "Spec strings" are a list of command-line options to be passed to their
corresponding program.  In addition, the spec strings can contain
'%'-prefixed sequences to substitute variable text or to conditionally
insert text into the command line.  Using these constructs it is
possible to generate quite complex command lines.

 Here is a table of all defined '%'-sequences for spec strings.  Note
that spaces are not generated automatically around the results of
expanding these sequences.  Therefore you can concatenate them together
or combine them with constant text in a single argument.

'%%'
     Substitute one '%' into the program name or argument.

'%i'
     Substitute the name of the input file being processed.

'%b'
     Substitute the basename of the input file being processed.  This is
     the substring up to (and not including) the last period and not
     including the directory.

'%B'
     This is the same as '%b', but include the file suffix (text after
     the last period).

'%d'
     Marks the argument containing or following the '%d' as a temporary
     file name, so that that file is deleted if GCC exits successfully.
     Unlike '%g', this contributes no text to the argument.

'%gSUFFIX'
     Substitute a file name that has suffix SUFFIX and is chosen once
     per compilation, and mark the argument in the same way as '%d'.  To
     reduce exposure to denial-of-service attacks, the file name is now
     chosen in a way that is hard to predict even when previously chosen
     file names are known.  For example, '%g.s ... %g.o ... %g.s' might
     turn into 'ccUVUUAU.s ccXYAXZ12.o ccUVUUAU.s'.  SUFFIX matches the
     regexp '[.A-Za-z]*' or the special string '%O', which is treated
     exactly as if '%O' had been preprocessed.  Previously, '%g' was
     simply substituted with a file name chosen once per compilation,
     without regard to any appended suffix (which was therefore treated
     just like ordinary text), making such attacks more likely to
     succeed.

'%uSUFFIX'
     Like '%g', but generates a new temporary file name each time it
     appears instead of once per compilation.

'%USUFFIX'
     Substitutes the last file name generated with '%uSUFFIX',
     generating a new one if there is no such last file name.  In the
     absence of any '%uSUFFIX', this is just like '%gSUFFIX', except
     they don't share the same suffix _space_, so '%g.s ... %U.s ...
     %g.s ... %U.s' involves the generation of two distinct file names,
     one for each '%g.s' and another for each '%U.s'.  Previously, '%U'
     was simply substituted with a file name chosen for the previous
     '%u', without regard to any appended suffix.

'%jSUFFIX'
     Substitutes the name of the 'HOST_BIT_BUCKET', if any, and if it is
     writable, and if '-save-temps' is not used; otherwise, substitute
     the name of a temporary file, just like '%u'.  This temporary file
     is not meant for communication between processes, but rather as a
     junk disposal mechanism.

'%|SUFFIX'
'%mSUFFIX'
     Like '%g', except if '-pipe' is in effect.  In that case '%|'
     substitutes a single dash and '%m' substitutes nothing at all.
     These are the two most common ways to instruct a program that it
     should read from standard input or write to standard output.  If
     you need something more elaborate you can use an '%{pipe:'X'}'
     construct: see for example 'f/lang-specs.h'.

'%.SUFFIX'
     Substitutes .SUFFIX for the suffixes of a matched switch's args
     when it is subsequently output with '%*'.  SUFFIX is terminated by
     the next space or %.

'%w'
     Marks the argument containing or following the '%w' as the
     designated output file of this compilation.  This puts the argument
     into the sequence of arguments that '%o' substitutes.

'%o'
     Substitutes the names of all the output files, with spaces
     automatically placed around them.  You should write spaces around
     the '%o' as well or the results are undefined.  '%o' is for use in
     the specs for running the linker.  Input files whose names have no
     recognized suffix are not compiled at all, but they are included
     among the output files, so they are linked.

'%O'
     Substitutes the suffix for object files.  Note that this is handled
     specially when it immediately follows '%g, %u, or %U', because of
     the need for those to form complete file names.  The handling is
     such that '%O' is treated exactly as if it had already been
     substituted, except that '%g, %u, and %U' do not currently support
     additional SUFFIX characters following '%O' as they do following,
     for example, '.o'.

'%p'
     Substitutes the standard macro predefinitions for the current
     target machine.  Use this when running 'cpp'.

'%P'
     Like '%p', but puts '__' before and after the name of each
     predefined macro, except for macros that start with '__' or with
     '_L', where L is an uppercase letter.  This is for ISO C.

'%I'
     Substitute any of '-iprefix' (made from 'GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'),
     '-isysroot' (made from 'TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT'), '-isystem' (made from
     'COMPILER_PATH' and '-B' options) and '-imultilib' as necessary.

'%s'
     Current argument is the name of a library or startup file of some
     sort.  Search for that file in a standard list of directories and
     substitute the full name found.  The current working directory is
     included in the list of directories scanned.

'%T'
     Current argument is the name of a linker script.  Search for that
     file in the current list of directories to scan for libraries.  If
     the file is located insert a '--script' option into the command
     line followed by the full path name found.  If the file is not
     found then generate an error message.  Note: the current working
     directory is not searched.

'%eSTR'
     Print STR as an error message.  STR is terminated by a newline.
     Use this when inconsistent options are detected.

'%(NAME)'
     Substitute the contents of spec string NAME at this point.

'%x{OPTION}'
     Accumulate an option for '%X'.

'%X'
     Output the accumulated linker options specified by '-Wl' or a '%x'
     spec string.

'%Y'
     Output the accumulated assembler options specified by '-Wa'.

'%Z'
     Output the accumulated preprocessor options specified by '-Wp'.

'%a'
     Process the 'asm' spec.  This is used to compute the switches to be
     passed to the assembler.

'%A'
     Process the 'asm_final' spec.  This is a spec string for passing
     switches to an assembler post-processor, if such a program is
     needed.

'%l'
     Process the 'link' spec.  This is the spec for computing the
     command line passed to the linker.  Typically it makes use of the
     '%L %G %S %D and %E' sequences.

'%D'
     Dump out a '-L' option for each directory that GCC believes might
     contain startup files.  If the target supports multilibs then the
     current multilib directory is prepended to each of these paths.

'%L'
     Process the 'lib' spec.  This is a spec string for deciding which
     libraries are included on the command line to the linker.

'%G'
     Process the 'libgcc' spec.  This is a spec string for deciding
     which GCC support library is included on the command line to the
     linker.

'%S'
     Process the 'startfile' spec.  This is a spec for deciding which
     object files are the first ones passed to the linker.  Typically
     this might be a file named 'crt0.o'.

'%E'
     Process the 'endfile' spec.  This is a spec string that specifies
     the last object files that are passed to the linker.

'%C'
     Process the 'cpp' spec.  This is used to construct the arguments to
     be passed to the C preprocessor.

'%1'
     Process the 'cc1' spec.  This is used to construct the options to
     be passed to the actual C compiler ('cc1').

'%2'
     Process the 'cc1plus' spec.  This is used to construct the options
     to be passed to the actual C++ compiler ('cc1plus').

'%*'
     Substitute the variable part of a matched option.  See below.  Note
     that each comma in the substituted string is replaced by a single
     space.

'%<S'
     Remove all occurrences of '-S' from the command line.  Note--this
     command is position dependent.  '%' commands in the spec string
     before this one see '-S', '%' commands in the spec string after
     this one do not.

'%:FUNCTION(ARGS)'
     Call the named function FUNCTION, passing it ARGS.  ARGS is first
     processed as a nested spec string, then split into an argument
     vector in the usual fashion.  The function returns a string which
     is processed as if it had appeared literally as part of the current
     spec.

     The following built-in spec functions are provided:

     'getenv'
          The 'getenv' spec function takes two arguments: an environment
          variable name and a string.  If the environment variable is
          not defined, a fatal error is issued.  Otherwise, the return
          value is the value of the environment variable concatenated
          with the string.  For example, if 'TOPDIR' is defined as
          '/path/to/top', then:

               %:getenv(TOPDIR /include)

          expands to '/path/to/top/include'.

     'if-exists'
          The 'if-exists' spec function takes one argument, an absolute
          pathname to a file.  If the file exists, 'if-exists' returns
          the pathname.  Here is a small example of its usage:

               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) crtbegin%O%s

     'if-exists-else'
          The 'if-exists-else' spec function is similar to the
          'if-exists' spec function, except that it takes two arguments.
          The first argument is an absolute pathname to a file.  If the
          file exists, 'if-exists-else' returns the pathname.  If it
          does not exist, it returns the second argument.  This way,
          'if-exists-else' can be used to select one file or another,
          based on the existence of the first.  Here is a small example
          of its usage:

               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) \
               %:if-exists-else(crtbeginT%O%s crtbegin%O%s)

     'replace-outfile'
          The 'replace-outfile' spec function takes two arguments.  It
          looks for the first argument in the outfiles array and
          replaces it with the second argument.  Here is a small example
          of its usage:

               %{fgnu-runtime:%:replace-outfile(-lobjc -lobjc-gnu)}

     'remove-outfile'
          The 'remove-outfile' spec function takes one argument.  It
          looks for the first argument in the outfiles array and removes
          it.  Here is a small example its usage:

               %:remove-outfile(-lm)

     'pass-through-libs'
          The 'pass-through-libs' spec function takes any number of
          arguments.  It finds any '-l' options and any non-options
          ending in '.a' (which it assumes are the names of linker input
          library archive files) and returns a result containing all the
          found arguments each prepended by '-plugin-opt=-pass-through='
          and joined by spaces.  This list is intended to be passed to
          the LTO linker plugin.

               %:pass-through-libs(%G %L %G)

     'print-asm-header'
          The 'print-asm-header' function takes no arguments and simply
          prints a banner like:

               Assembler options
               =================

               Use "-Wa,OPTION" to pass "OPTION" to the assembler.

          It is used to separate compiler options from assembler options
          in the '--target-help' output.

'%{S}'
     Substitutes the '-S' switch, if that switch is given to GCC.  If
     that switch is not specified, this substitutes nothing.  Note that
     the leading dash is omitted when specifying this option, and it is
     automatically inserted if the substitution is performed.  Thus the
     spec string '%{foo}' matches the command-line option '-foo' and
     outputs the command-line option '-foo'.

'%W{S}'
     Like %{'S'} but mark last argument supplied within as a file to be
     deleted on failure.

'%{S*}'
     Substitutes all the switches specified to GCC whose names start
     with '-S', but which also take an argument.  This is used for
     switches like '-o', '-D', '-I', etc.  GCC considers '-o foo' as
     being one switch whose name starts with 'o'.  %{o*} substitutes
     this text, including the space.  Thus two arguments are generated.

'%{S*&T*}'
     Like %{'S'*}, but preserve order of 'S' and 'T' options (the order
     of 'S' and 'T' in the spec is not significant).  There can be any
     number of ampersand-separated variables; for each the wild card is
     optional.  Useful for CPP as '%{D*&U*&A*}'.

'%{S:X}'
     Substitutes 'X', if the '-S' switch is given to GCC.

'%{!S:X}'
     Substitutes 'X', if the '-S' switch is _not_ given to GCC.

'%{S*:X}'
     Substitutes 'X' if one or more switches whose names start with '-S'
     are specified to GCC.  Normally 'X' is substituted only once, no
     matter how many such switches appeared.  However, if '%*' appears
     somewhere in 'X', then 'X' is substituted once for each matching
     switch, with the '%*' replaced by the part of that switch matching
     the '*'.

     If '%*' appears as the last part of a spec sequence then a space
     will be added after the end of the last substitution.  If there is
     more text in the sequence however then a space will not be
     generated.  This allows the '%*' substitution to be used as part of
     a larger string.  For example, a spec string like this:

          %{mcu=*:--script=%*/memory.ld}

     when matching an option like '-mcu=newchip' will produce:

          --script=newchip/memory.ld

'%{.S:X}'
     Substitutes 'X', if processing a file with suffix 'S'.

'%{!.S:X}'
     Substitutes 'X', if _not_ processing a file with suffix 'S'.

'%{,S:X}'
     Substitutes 'X', if processing a file for language 'S'.

'%{!,S:X}'
     Substitutes 'X', if not processing a file for language 'S'.

'%{S|P:X}'
     Substitutes 'X' if either '-S' or '-P' is given to GCC.  This may
     be combined with '!', '.', ',', and '*' sequences as well, although
     they have a stronger binding than the '|'.  If '%*' appears in 'X',
     all of the alternatives must be starred, and only the first
     matching alternative is substituted.

     For example, a spec string like this:

          %{.c:-foo} %{!.c:-bar} %{.c|d:-baz} %{!.c|d:-boggle}

     outputs the following command-line options from the following input
     command-line options:

          fred.c        -foo -baz
          jim.d         -bar -boggle
          -d fred.c     -foo -baz -boggle
          -d jim.d      -bar -baz -boggle

'%{S:X; T:Y; :D}'

     If 'S' is given to GCC, substitutes 'X'; else if 'T' is given to
     GCC, substitutes 'Y'; else substitutes 'D'.  There can be as many
     clauses as you need.  This may be combined with '.', ',', '!', '|',
     and '*' as needed.

 The conditional text 'X' in a %{'S':'X'} or similar construct may
contain other nested '%' constructs or spaces, or even newlines.  They
are processed as usual, as described above.  Trailing white space in 'X'
is ignored.  White space may also appear anywhere on the left side of
the colon in these constructs, except between '.' or '*' and the
corresponding word.

 The '-O', '-f', '-m', and '-W' switches are handled specifically in
these constructs.  If another value of '-O' or the negated form of a
'-f', '-m', or '-W' switch is found later in the command line, the
earlier switch value is ignored, except with {'S'*} where 'S' is just
one letter, which passes all matching options.

 The character '|' at the beginning of the predicate text is used to
indicate that a command should be piped to the following command, but
only if '-pipe' is specified.

 It is built into GCC which switches take arguments and which do not.
(You might think it would be useful to generalize this to allow each
compiler's spec to say which switches take arguments.  But this cannot
be done in a consistent fashion.  GCC cannot even decide which input
files have been specified without knowing which switches take arguments,
and it must know which input files to compile in order to tell which
compilers to run).

 GCC also knows implicitly that arguments starting in '-l' are to be
treated as compiler output files, and passed to the linker in their
proper position among the other output files.

3.16 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version
===================================================

The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called 'gcc', or
'MACHINE-gcc' when cross-compiling, or 'MACHINE-gcc-VERSION' to run a
version other than the one that was installed last.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Submodel Options,  Next: Code Gen Options,  Prev: Target Options,  Up: Invoking GCC

3.17 Hardware Models and Configurations
=======================================

Each target machine types can have its own special options, starting
with '-m', to choose among various hardware models or
configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating coprocessor or
none.  A single installed version of the compiler can compile for any
model or configuration, according to the options specified.

 Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

3.17.1 AArch64 Options
----------------------

These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

'-mabi=NAME'
     Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible values are
     'ilp32' for SysV-like data model where int, long int and pointer
     are 32-bit, and 'lp64' for SysV-like data model where int is
     32-bit, but long int and pointer are 64-bit.

     The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note
     that the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
     compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
     compatible set of libraries.

'-mbig-endian'
     Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is
     configured for an 'aarch64_be-*-*' target.

'-mgeneral-regs-only'
     Generate code which uses only the general registers.

'-mlittle-endian'
     Generate little-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is
     configured for an 'aarch64-*-*' but not an 'aarch64_be-*-*' target.

'-mcmodel=tiny'
     Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its
     statically defined symbols must be within 1GB of each other.
     Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically
     linked.  This model is not fully implemented and mostly treated as
     'small'.

'-mcmodel=small'
     Generate code for the small code model.  The program and its
     statically defined symbols must be within 4GB of each other.
     Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically
     linked.  This is the default code model.

'-mcmodel=large'
     Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no assumptions
     about addresses and sizes of sections.  Pointers are 64 bits.
     Programs can be statically linked only.

'-mstrict-align'
     Do not assume that unaligned memory references will be handled by
     the system.

'-momit-leaf-frame-pointer'
'-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer'
     Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former
     behaviour is the default.

'-mtls-dialect=desc'
     Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for
     dynamic accesses of TLS variables.  This is the default.

'-mtls-dialect=traditional'
     Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism for
     dynamic accesses of TLS variables.

'-mfix-cortex-a53-835769'
'-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769'
     Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53 erratum
     number 835769.  This will involve inserting a NOP instruction
     between memory instructions and 64-bit integer multiply-accumulate
     instructions.

'-march=NAME'
     Specify the name of the target architecture, optionally suffixed by
     one or more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
     '-march=ARCH{+[no]FEATURE}*', where the only permissible value for
     ARCH is 'armv8-a'.  The permissible values for FEATURE are
     documented in the sub-section below.

     Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most
     feature is used.

     GCC uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can
     emit when generating assembly code.

     Where '-march' is specified without either of '-mtune' or '-mcpu'
     also being specified, the code will be tuned to perform well across
     a range of target processors implementing the target architecture.

'-mtune=NAME'
     Specify the name of the target processor for which GCC should tune
     the performance of the code.  Permissible values for this option
     are: 'generic', 'cortex-a53', 'cortex-a57'.

     Additionally, this option can specify that GCC should tune the
     performance of the code for a big.LITTLE system.  The only
     permissible value is 'cortex-a57.cortex-a53'.

     Where none of '-mtune=', '-mcpu=' or '-march=' are specified, the
     code will be tuned to perform well across a range of target
     processors.

     This option cannot be suffixed by feature modifiers.

'-mcpu=NAME'
     Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed by
     one or more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
     '-mcpu=CPU{+[no]FEATURE}*', where the permissible values for CPU
     are the same as those available for '-mtune'.

     The permissible values for FEATURE are documented in the
     sub-section below.

     Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most
     feature is used.

     GCC uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can
     emit when generating assembly code (as if by '-march') and to
     determine the target processor for which to tune for performance
     (as if by '-mtune').  Where this option is used in conjunction with
     '-march' or '-mtune', those options take precedence over the
     appropriate part of this option.

3.17.1.1 '-march' and '-mcpu' feature modifiers
...............................................

Feature modifiers used with '-march' and '-mcpu' can be one the
following:

'crc'
     Enable CRC extension.
'crypto'
     Enable Crypto extension.  This implies Advanced SIMD is enabled.
'fp'
     Enable floating-point instructions.
'simd'
     Enable Advanced SIMD instructions.  This implies floating-point
     instructions are enabled.  This is the default for all current
     possible values for options '-march' and '-mcpu='.

3.17.2 Adapteva Epiphany Options
--------------------------------

These '-m' options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:

'-mhalf-reg-file'
     Don't allocate any register in the range 'r32'...'r63'.  That
     allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.

'-mprefer-short-insn-regs'
     Preferrentially allocate registers that allow short instruction
     generation.  This can result in increased instruction count, so
     this may either reduce or increase overall code size.

'-mbranch-cost=NUM'
     Set the cost of branches to roughly NUM "simple" instructions.
     This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
     consistent results across releases.

'-mcmove'
     Enable the generation of conditional moves.

'-mnops=NUM'
     Emit NUM NOPs before every other generated instruction.

'-mno-soft-cmpsf'
     For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an 'fsub'
     instruction and test the flags.  This is faster than a software
     comparison, but can get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs,
     or when two different small numbers are compared such that their
     difference is calculated as zero.  The default is '-msoft-cmpsf',
     which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant, software comparisons.

'-mstack-offset=NUM'
     Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
     E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range
     'sp+0...sp+7' can be used by leaf functions without stack
     allocation.  Values other than '8' or '16' are untested and
     unlikely to work.  Note also that this option changes the ABI;
     compiling a program with a different stack offset than the
     libraries have been compiled with generally does not work.  This
     option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
     offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different
     stack offset to build working programs, it is recommended to
     configure the toolchain with the appropriate
     '--with-stack-offset=NUM' option.

'-mno-round-nearest'
     Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
     truncating.  The default is '-mround-nearest'.

'-mlong-calls'
     If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might
     be beyond the offset range of the 'b' / 'bl' instructions, and
     therefore load the function address into a register before
     performing a (otherwise direct) call.  This is the default.

'-mshort-calls'
     If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls
     are in the range of the 'b' / 'bl' instructions, so use these
     instructions for direct calls.  The default is '-mlong-calls'.

'-msmall16'
     Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.  This
     does not apply to function addresses for which '-mlong-calls'
     semantics are in effect.

'-mfp-mode=MODE'
     Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.  This
     determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected at
     function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
     predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller
     and faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.

     MODE can be set to one the following values:

     'caller'
          Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored
          when the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
          This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other
          compilation units you might want to incorporate into different
          programs with different prevailing FPU modes, and the
          convenience of being able to use a single object file
          outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra mode
          switching that might be needed, compared with what would be
          needed with a more specific choice of prevailing FPU mode.

     'truncate'
          This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
          truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That
          includes conversion from floating point to integer.

     'round-nearest'
          This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
          round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.

     'int'
          This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the
          FPU, e.g. integer multiply, or integer
          multiply-and-accumulate.

     The default is '-mfp-mode=caller'

'-mnosplit-lohi'
'-mno-postinc'
'-mno-postmodify'
     Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of
     32-bit loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and
     generation of post-modify addresses.  The defaults are
     'msplit-lohi', '-mpost-inc', and '-mpost-modify'.

'-mnovect-double'
     Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode.  The default is
     '-mvect-double', which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.

'-max-vect-align=NUM'
     The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types.  NUM may be 4 or
     8.  The default is 8.  Note that this is an ABI change, even though
     many library function interfaces are unaffected if they don't use
     SIMD vector modes in places that affect size and/or alignment of
     relevant types.

'-msplit-vecmove-early'
     Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory
     this can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse
     seems to be generally the case.

'-m1reg-REG'
     Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes loading
     small negative constants and certain bitmasks faster.  Allowable
     values for REG are 'r43' and 'r63', which specify use of that
     register as a fixed register, and 'none', which means that no
     register is used for this purpose.  The default is '-m1reg-none'.

3.17.3 ARC Options
------------------

The following options control the architecture variant for which code is
being compiled:

'-mbarrel-shifter'
     Generate instructions supported by barrel shifter.  This is the
     default unless '-mcpu=ARC601' is in effect.

'-mcpu=CPU'
     Set architecture type, register usage, and instruction scheduling
     parameters for CPU.  There are also shortcut alias options
     available for backward compatibility and convenience.  Supported

     'ARC700'
          Compile for ARC700.  Aliases: '-mA7', '-mARC700'.  This is the
          default when configured with '--with-cpu=arc700'.

     FPX: Generate Double Precision FPX instructions, tuned for the
     compact implementation.

'-mdpfp-fast'
     FPX: Generate Double Precision FPX instructions, tuned for the fast
     implementation.

'-mno-dpfp-lrsr'
     Disable LR and SR instructions from using FPX extension aux
     registers.

     'adds', 'subs', and 'sat16' are supported.  This is always enabled
     for '-mcpu=ARC700'.

'-mno-mpy'
     Do not generate mpy instructions for ARC700.

'-mmul32x16'
     Generate 32x16 bit multiply and mac instructions.

'-mmul64'

     is in effect.

'-mspfp'
'-mspfp-compact'
     FPX: Generate Single Precision FPX instructions, tuned for the
     compact implementation.

'-mspfp-fast'
     FPX: Generate Single Precision FPX instructions, tuned for the fast
     implementation.

'-msimd'
     Enable generation of ARC SIMD instructions via target-specific
     builtins.  Only valid for '-mcpu=ARC700'.

'-msoft-float'
     This option ignored; it is provided for compatibility purposes
     only.  Software floating point code is emitted by default, and this
     default can overridden by FPX options; 'mspfp', 'mspfp-compact', or
     'mspfp-fast' for single precision, and 'mdpfp', 'mdpfp-compact', or
     'mdpfp-fast' for double precision.

'-mswap'
     Generate swap instructions.

 The following options are passed through to the assembler, and also
define preprocessor macro symbols.

'-mdsp-packa'
     Passed down to the assembler to enable the DSP Pack A extensions.
     Also sets the preprocessor symbol '__Xdsp_packa'.

'-mdvbf'
     Passed down to the assembler to enable the dual viterbi butterfly
     extension.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol '__Xdvbf'.

'-mlock'
     Passed down to the assembler to enable the Locked Load/Store
     Conditional extension.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol
     '__Xlock'.

'-mmac-d16'
     Passed down to the assembler.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol
     '__Xxmac_d16'.

'-mmac-24'
     Passed down to the assembler.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol
     '__Xxmac_24'.

'-mrtsc'

     extension instruction.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol
     '__Xswape'.

'-mtelephony'
     Passed down to the assembler to enable dual and single operand
     instructions for telephony.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol
     '__Xtelephony'.

'-mxy'
     Passed down to the assembler to enable the XY Memory extension.
     Also sets the preprocessor symbol '__Xxy'.

 The following options control how the assembly code is annotated:

'-misize'
     Annotate assembler instructions with estimated addresses.

'-mannotate-align'
     Explain what alignment considerations lead to the decision to make
     an instruction short or long.

 The following options are passed through to the linker:

'-marclinux'
     Passed through to the linker, to specify use of the 'arclinux'
     emulation.  This option is enabled by default in tool chains built
     for 'arc-linux-uclibc' and 'arceb-linux-uclibc' targets when
     profiling is not requested.

'-marclinux_prof'
     Passed through to the linker, to specify use of the 'arclinux_prof'
     emulation.  This option is enabled by default in tool chains built
     for 'arc-linux-uclibc' and 'arceb-linux-uclibc' targets when
     profiling is requested.

 The following options control the semantics of generated code:

'-mepilogue-cfi'
     Enable generation of call frame information for epilogues.

'-mno-epilogue-cfi'
     Disable generation of call frame information for epilogues.

'-mlong-calls'
     Generate call insns as register indirect calls, thus providing
     access to the full 32-bit address range.

'-mmedium-calls'
     Don't use less than 25 bit addressing range for calls, which is the
     offset available for an unconditional branch-and-link instruction.
     Conditional execution of function calls is suppressed, to allow use
     of the 25-bit range, rather than the 21-bit range with conditional
     branch-and-link.  This is the default for tool chains built for 'arc-linux-uclibc'
     and 'arceb-linux-uclibc' targets.

'-mno-sdata'
     Do not generate sdata references.  This is the default for tool
     chains built for 'arc-linux-uclibc' and 'arceb-linux-uclibc'
     targets.

'-mucb-mcount'
     Instrument with mcount calls as used in UCB code.  I.e.  do the
     counting in the callee, not the caller.  By default ARC
     instrumentation counts in the caller.

'-mvolatile-cache'
     Use ordinarily cached memory accesses for volatile references.
     This is the default.

'-mno-volatile-cache'
     Enable cache bypass for volatile references.

 The following options fine tune code generation:
'-malign-call'
     Do alignment optimizations for call instructions.

'-mauto-modify-reg'
     Enable the use of pre/post modify with register displacement.

'-mbbit-peephole'
     Enable bbit peephole2.

'-mno-brcc'
     This option disables a target-specific pass in 'arc_reorg' to
     generate 'BRcc' instructions.  It has no effect on 'BRcc'
     generation driven by the combiner pass.

'-mcase-vector-pcrel'
     Use pc-relative switch case tables - this enables case table
     shortening.  This is the default for '-Os'.

'-mcompact-casesi'
     Enable compact casesi pattern.  This is the default for '-Os'.

'-mno-cond-exec'
     Disable ARCompact specific pass to generate conditional execution
     instructions.  Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions
     between operand numbers, literal sizes, instruction lengths, and
     the support for conditional execution, the target-independent pass
     to generate conditional execution is often lacking, so the ARC port
     has kept a special pass around that tries to find more conditional
     execution generating opportunities after register allocation,
     branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have been done.
