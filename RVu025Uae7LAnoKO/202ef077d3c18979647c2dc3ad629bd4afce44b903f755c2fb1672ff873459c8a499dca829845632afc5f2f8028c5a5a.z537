bol definitions from shared libraries, such as when they are
particularly large or there are many of them.

   To control the automatic loading of shared library symbols, use the
commands:

'set auto-solib-add MODE'
     If MODE is 'on', symbols from all shared object libraries will be
     loaded automatically when the inferior begins execution, you attach
     to an independently started inferior, or when the dynamic linker
     informs GDB that a new library has been loaded.  If MODE is 'off',
     symbols must be loaded manually, using the 'sharedlibrary' command.
     The default value is 'on'.

     If your program uses lots of shared libraries with debug info that
     takes large amounts of memory, you can decrease the GDB memory
     footprint by preventing it from automatically loading the symbols
     from shared libraries.  To that end, type 'set auto-solib-add off'
     before running the inferior, then load each library whose debug
     symbols you do need with 'sharedlibrary REGEXP', where REGEXP is a
     regular expression that matches the libraries whose symbols you
     want to be loaded.

'show auto-solib-add'
     Display the current autoloading mode.

   To explicitly load shared library symbols, use the 'sharedlibrary'
command:

'info share REGEX'
'info sharedlibrary REGEX'
     Print the names of the shared libraries which are currently loaded
     that match REGEX.  If REGEX is omitted then print all shared
     libraries that are loaded.

'sharedlibrary REGEX'
'share REGEX'
     Load shared object library symbols for files matching a Unix
     regular expression.  As with files loaded automatically, it only
     loads shared libraries required by your program for a core file or
     after typing 'run'.  If REGEX is omitted all shared libraries
     required by your program are loaded.

'nosharedlibrary'
     Unload all shared object library symbols.  This discards all
     symbols that have been loaded from all shared libraries.  Symbols
     from shared libraries that were loaded by explicit user requests
     are not discarded.

   Sometimes you may wish that GDB stops and gives you control when any
of shared library events happen.  The best way to do this is to use
'catch load' and 'catch unload' (*note Set Catchpoints::).

   GDB also supports the the 'set stop-on-solib-events' command for
this.  This command exists for historical reasons.  It is less useful
than setting a catchpoint, because it does not allow for conditions or
commands as a catchpoint does.

'set stop-on-solib-events'
     This command controls whether GDB should give you control when the
     dynamic linker notifies it about some shared library event.  The
     most common event of interest is loading or unloading of a new
     shared library.

'show stop-on-solib-events'
     Show whether GDB stops and gives you control when shared library
     events happen.

   Shared libraries are also supported in many cross or remote debugging
configurations.  GDB needs to have access to the target's libraries;
this can be accomplished either by providing copies of the libraries on
the host system, or by asking GDB to automatically retrieve the
libraries from the target.  If copies of the target libraries are
provided, they need to be the same as the target libraries, although the
copies on the target can be stripped as long as the copies on the host
are not.

   For remote debugging, you need to tell GDB where the target libraries
are, so that it can load the correct copies--otherwise, it may try to
load the host's libraries.  GDB has two variables to specify the search
directories for target libraries.

'set sysroot PATH'
     Use PATH as the system root for the program being debugged.  Any
     absolute shared library paths will be prefixed with PATH; many
     runtime loaders store the absolute paths to the shared library in
     the target program's memory.  If you use 'set sysroot' to find
     shared libraries, they need to be laid out in the same way that
     they are on the target, with e.g. a '/lib' and '/usr/lib' hierarchy
     under PATH.

     If PATH starts with the sequence 'remote:', GDB will retrieve the
     target libraries from the remote system.  This is only supported
     when using a remote target that supports the 'remote get' command
     (*note Sending files to a remote system: File Transfer.).  The part
     of PATH following the initial 'remote:' (if present) is used as
     system root prefix on the remote file system.  (1)

     For targets with an MS-DOS based filesystem, such as MS-Windows and
     SymbianOS, GDB tries prefixing a few variants of the target
     absolute file name with PATH.  But first, on Unix hosts, GDB
     converts all backslash directory separators into forward slashes,
     because the backslash is not a directory separator on Unix:

            c:\foo\bar.dll => c:/foo/bar.dll

     Then, GDB attempts prefixing the target file name with PATH, and
     looks for the resulting file name in the host file system:

            c:/foo/bar.dll => /path/to/sysroot/c:/foo/bar.dll

     If that does not find the shared library, GDB tries removing the
     ':' character from the drive spec, both for convenience, and, for
     the case of the host file system not supporting file names with
     colons:

            c:/foo/bar.dll => /path/to/sysroot/c/foo/bar.dll

     This makes it possible to have a system root that mirrors a target
     with more than one drive.  E.g., you may want to setup your local
     copies of the target system shared libraries like so (note 'c' vs
     'z'):

           /path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/foo.dll
           /path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/bar.dll
           /path/to/sysroot/z/sys/bin/bar.dll

     and point the system root at '/path/to/sysroot', so that GDB can
     find the correct copies of both 'c:\sys\bin\foo.dll', and
     'z:\sys\bin\bar.dll'.

     If that still does not find the shared library, GDB tries removing
     the whole drive spec from the target file name:

            c:/foo/bar.dll => /path/to/sysroot/foo/bar.dll

     This last lookup makes it possible to not care about the drive
     name, if you don't want or need to.

     The 'set solib-absolute-prefix' command is an alias for 'set
     sysroot'.

     You can set the default system root by using the configure-time
     '--with-sysroot' option.  If the system root is inside GDB's
     configured binary prefix (set with '--prefix' or '--exec-prefix'),
     then the default system root will be updated automatically if the
     installed GDB is moved to a new location.

'show sysroot'
     Display the current shared library prefix.

'set solib-search-path PATH'
     If this variable is set, PATH is a colon-separated list of
     directories to search for shared libraries.  'solib-search-path' is
     used after 'sysroot' fails to locate the library, or if the path to
     the library is relative instead of absolute.  If you want to use
     'solib-search-path' instead of 'sysroot', be sure to set 'sysroot'
     to a nonexistent directory to prevent GDB from finding your host's
     libraries.  'sysroot' is preferred; setting it to a nonexistent
     directory may interfere with automatic loading of shared library
     symbols.

'show solib-search-path'
     Display the current shared library search path.

'set target-file-system-kind KIND'
     Set assumed file system kind for target reported file names.

     Shared library file names as reported by the target system may not
     make sense as is on the system GDB is running on.  For example,
     when remote debugging a target that has MS-DOS based file system
     semantics, from a Unix host, the target may be reporting to GDB a
     list of loaded shared libraries with file names such as
     'c:\Windows\kernel32.dll'.  On Unix hosts, there's no concept of
     drive letters, so the 'c:\' prefix is not normally understood as
     indicating an absolute file name, and neither is the backslash
     normally considered a directory separator character.  In that case,
     the native file system would interpret this whole absolute file
     name as a relative file name with no directory components.  This
     would make it impossible to point GDB at a copy of the remote
     target's shared libraries on the host using 'set sysroot', and
     impractical with 'set solib-search-path'.  Setting
     'target-file-system-kind' to 'dos-based' tells GDB to interpret
     such file names similarly to how the target would, and to map them
     to file names valid on GDB's native file system semantics.  The
     value of KIND can be '"auto"', in addition to one of the supported
     file system kinds.  In that case, GDB tries to determine the
     appropriate file system variant based on the current target's
     operating system (*note Configuring the Current ABI: ABI.).  The
     supported file system settings are:

     'unix'
          Instruct GDB to assume the target file system is of Unix kind.
          Only file names starting the forward slash ('/') character are
          considered absolute, and the directory separator character is
          also the forward slash.

     'dos-based'
          Instruct GDB to assume the target file system is DOS based.
          File names starting with either a forward slash, or a drive
          letter followed by a colon (e.g., 'c:'), are considered
          absolute, and both the slash ('/') and the backslash ('\\')
          characters are considered directory separators.

     'auto'
          Instruct GDB to use the file system kind associated with the
          target operating system (*note Configuring the Current ABI:
          ABI.).  This is the default.

   When processing file names provided by the user, GDB frequently needs
to compare them to the file names recorded in the program's debug info.
Normally, GDB compares just the "base names" of the files as strings,
which is reasonably fast even for very large programs.  (The base name
of a file is the last portion of its name, after stripping all the
leading directories.)  This shortcut in comparison is based upon the
assumption that files cannot have more than one base name.  This is
usually true, but references to files that use symlinks or similar
filesystem facilities violate that assumption.  If your program records
files using such facilities, or if you provide file names to GDB using
symlinks etc., you can set 'basenames-may-differ' to 'true' to instruct
GDB to completely canonicalize each pair of file names it needs to
compare.  This will make file-name comparisons accurate, but at a price
of a significant slowdown.

'set basenames-may-differ'
     Set whether a source file may have multiple base names.

'show basenames-may-differ'
     Show whether a source file may have multiple base names.

happens to be named 'remote:', you need to use some equivalent variant
of the name like './remote:'.

18.2 Debugging Information in Separate Files
============================================

GDB allows you to put a program's debugging information in a file
separate from the executable itself, in a way that allows GDB to find
and load the debugging information automatically.  Since debugging
information can be very large--sometimes larger than the executable code
itself--some systems distribute debugging information for their
executables in separate files, which users can install only when they
need to debug a problem.

   GDB supports two ways of specifying the separate debug info file:

   * The executable contains a "debug link" that specifies the name of
     the separate debug info file.  The separate debug file's name is
     usually 'EXECUTABLE.debug', where EXECUTABLE is the name of the
     corresponding executable file without leading directories (e.g.,
     'ls.debug' for '/usr/bin/ls').  In addition, the debug link
     specifies a 32-bit "Cyclic Redundancy Check" (CRC) checksum for the
     debug file, which GDB uses to validate that the executable and the
     debug file came from the same build.

   * The executable contains a "build ID", a unique bit string that is
     also present in the corresponding debug info file.  (This is
     supported only on some operating systems, notably those which use
     the ELF format for binary files and the GNU Binutils.)  For more
     details about this feature, see the description of the '--build-id'
     command-line option in *note Command Line Options:
     (ld.info)Options.  The debug info file's name is not specified
     explicitly by the build ID, but can be computed from the build ID,
     see below.

   Depending on the way the debug info file is specified, GDB uses two
different methods of looking for the debug file:

   * For the "debug link" method, GDB looks up the named file in the
     directory of the executable file, then in a subdirectory of that
     directory named '.debug', and finally under each one of the global
     debug directories, in a subdirectory whose name is identical to the
     leading directories of the executable's absolute file name.

   * For the "build ID" method, GDB looks in the '.build-id'
     subdirectory of each one of the global debug directories for a file
     named 'NN/NNNNNNNN.debug', where NN are the first 2 hex characters
     of the build ID bit string, and NNNNNNNN are the rest of the bit
     string.  (Real build ID strings are 32 or more hex characters, not
     10.)

   So, for example, suppose you ask GDB to debug '/usr/bin/ls', which
has a debug link that specifies the file 'ls.debug', and a build ID
whose value in hex is 'abcdef1234'.  If the list of the global debug
directories includes '/usr/lib/debug', then GDB will look for the
following debug information files, in the indicated order:

   - '/usr/lib/debug/.build-id/ab/cdef1234.debug'
   - '/usr/bin/ls.debug'
   - '/usr/bin/.debug/ls.debug'
   - '/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/ls.debug'.

   Global debugging info directories default to what is set by GDB
configure option '--with-separate-debug-dir'.  During GDB run you can
also set the global debugging info directories, and view the list GDB is
currently using.

'set debug-file-directory DIRECTORIES'
     Set the directories which GDB searches for separate debugging
     information files to DIRECTORY.  Multiple path components can be
     set concatenating them by a path separator.

'show debug-file-directory'
     Show the directories GDB searches for separate debugging
     information files.

   A debug link is a special section of the executable file named
'.gnu_debuglink'.  The section must contain:

   * A filename, with any leading directory components removed, followed
     by a zero byte,
   * zero to three bytes of padding, as needed to reach the next
     four-byte boundary within the section, and
   * a four-byte CRC checksum, stored in the same endianness used for
     the executable file itself.  The checksum is computed on the
     debugging information file's full contents by the function given
     below, passing zero as the CRC argument.

   Any executable file format can carry a debug link, as long as it can
contain a section named '.gnu_debuglink' with the contents described
above.

   The build ID is a special section in the executable file (and in
other ELF binary files that GDB may consider).  This section is often
named '.note.gnu.build-id', but that name is not mandatory.  It contains
unique identification for the built files--the ID remains the same
across multiple builds of the same build tree.  The default algorithm
SHA1 produces 160 bits (40 hexadecimal characters) of the content for
the build ID string.  The same section with an identical value is
present in the original built binary with symbols, in its stripped
variant, and in the separate debugging information file.

   The debugging information file itself should be an ordinary
executable, containing a full set of linker symbols, sections, and
debugging information.  The sections of the debugging information file
should have the same names, addresses, and sizes as the original file,
but they need not contain any data--much like a '.bss' section in an
ordinary executable.

   The GNU binary utilities (Binutils) package includes the 'objcopy'
utility that can produce the separated executable / debugging
information file pairs using the following commands:

     objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.debug
     strip -g foo

These commands remove the debugging information from the executable file
'foo' and place it in the file 'foo.debug'.  You can use the first,
second or both methods to link the two files:

   * The debug link method needs the following additional command to
     also leave behind a debug link in 'foo':

          objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.debug foo

     Ulrich Drepper's 'elfutils' package, starting with version 0.53,
     contains a version of the 'strip' command such that the command
     'strip foo -f foo.debug' has the same functionality as the two
     'objcopy' commands and the 'ln -s' command above, together.

   * Build ID gets embedded into the main executable using 'ld
     --build-id' or the GCC counterpart 'gcc -Wl,--build-id'.  Build ID
     support plus compatibility fixes for debug files separation are
     present in GNU binary utilities (Binutils) package since version
     2.18.

   The CRC used in '.gnu_debuglink' is the CRC-32 defined in IEEE 802.3
using the polynomial:

      x^{32} + x^{26} + x^{23} + x^{22} + x^{16} + x^{12} + x^{11}
      + x^{10} + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1

   The function is computed byte at a time, taking the least significant
bit of each byte first.  The initial pattern '0xffffffff' is used, to
ensure leading zeros affect the CRC and the final result is inverted to
ensure trailing zeros also affect the CRC.

   _Note:_ This is the same CRC polynomial as used in handling the
"Remote Serial Protocol" 'qCRC' packet (*note qCRC packet::).  However
in the case of the Remote Serial Protocol, the CRC is computed _most_
significant bit first, and the result is not inverted, so trailing zeros
have no effect on the CRC value.

   To complete the description, we show below the code of the function
which produces the CRC used in '.gnu_debuglink'.  Inverting the
initially supplied 'crc' argument means that an initial call to this
function passing in zero will start computing the CRC using
'0xffffffff'.

18.3 Debugging information in a special section
===============================================

Some systems ship pre-built executables and libraries that have a
special '.gnu_debugdata' section.  This feature is called
"MiniDebugInfo".  This section holds an LZMA-compressed object and is
used to supply extra symbols for backtraces.

   The intent of this section is to provide extra minimal debugging
information for use in simple backtraces.  It is not intended to be a
replacement for full separate debugging information (*note Separate
Debug Files::).  The example below shows the intended use; however, GDB
does not currently put restrictions on what sort of debugging
information might be included in the section.

   GDB has support for this extension.  If the section exists, then it
is used provided that no other source of debugging information can be
found, and that GDB was configured with LZMA support.

   This section can be easily created using 'objcopy' and other standard
utilities:

     # Extract the dynamic symbols from the main binary, there is no need
     # to also have these in the normal symbol table.
     nm -D BINARY --format=posix --defined-only \
       | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort > dynsyms

     # Extract all the text (i.e. function) symbols from the debuginfo.
     # (Note that we actually also accept "D" symbols, for the benefit
     # of platforms like PowerPC64 that use function descriptors.)
     nm BINARY --format=posix --defined-only \
       | awk '{ if ($2 == "T" || $2 == "t" || $2 == "D") print $1 }' \
       | sort > funcsyms

     # Keep all the function symbols not already in the dynamic symbol
     # table.
     comm -13 dynsyms funcsyms > keep_symbols

     # Separate full debug info into debug binary.
     objcopy --only-keep-debug BINARY debug

     # Copy the full debuginfo, keeping only a minimal set of symbols and
     # removing some unnecessary sections.
     objcopy -S --remove-section .gdb_index --remove-section .comment \
       --keep-symbols=keep_symbols debug mini_debuginfo

     # Drop the full debug info from the original binary.
     strip --strip-all -R .comment BINARY

     # Inject the compressed data into the .gnu_debugdata section of the
     # original binary.
     xz mini_debuginfo
     objcopy --add-section .gnu_debugdata=mini_debuginfo.xz BINARY

18.4 Index Files Speed Up GDB
=============================

When GDB finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the file in order
to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most GDB operations
work quickly--at the cost of a delay early on.  For large programs, this
delay can be quite lengthy, so GDB provides a way to build an index,
which speeds up startup.

   The index is stored as a section in the symbol file.  GDB can write
the index to a file, then you can put it into the symbol file using
'objcopy'.

   To create an index file, use the 'save gdb-index' command:

'save gdb-index DIRECTORY'
     Create an index file for each symbol file currently known by GDB.
     Each file is named after its corresponding symbol file, with
     '.gdb-index' appended, and is written into the given DIRECTORY.

   Once you have created an index file you can merge it into your symbol
file, here named 'symfile', using 'objcopy':

     $ objcopy --add-section .gdb_index=symfile.gdb-index \
         --set-section-flags .gdb_index=readonly symfile symfile

   GDB will normally ignore older versions of '.gdb_index' sections that
have been deprecated.  Usually they are deprecated because they are
missing a new feature or have performance issues.  To tell GDB to use a
deprecated index section anyway specify 'set
use-deprecated-index-sections on'.  The default is 'off'.  This can
speed up startup, but may result in some functionality being lost.
*Note Index Section Format::.

   _Warning:_ Setting 'use-deprecated-index-sections' to 'on' must be
done before gdb reads the file.  The following will not work:

     $ gdb -ex "set use-deprecated-index-sections on" <program>

   Instead you must do, for example,

     $ gdb -iex "set use-deprecated-index-sections on" <program>

   There are currently some limitation on indices.  They only work when
for DWARF debugging information, not stabs.  And, they do not currently
work for programs using Ada.

18.5 Errors Reading Symbol Files
================================

While reading a symbol file, GDB occasionally encounters problems, such
as symbol types it does not recognize, or known bugs in compiler output.
By default, GDB does not notify you of such problems, since they are
relatively common and primarily of interest to people debugging
compilers.  If you are interested in seeing information about
ill-constructed symbol tables, you can either ask GDB to print only one
message about each such type of problem, no matter how many times the
problem occurs; or you can ask GDB to print more messages, to see how
many times the problems occur, with the 'set complaints' command (*note
Optional Warnings and Messages: Messages/Warnings.).

   The messages currently printed, and their meanings, include:

'inner block not inside outer block in SYMBOL'

     The symbol information shows where symbol scopes begin and end
     (such as at the start of a function or a block of statements).
     This error indicates that an inner scope block is not fully
     contained in its outer scope blocks.

     GDB circumvents the problem by treating the inner block as if it
     had the same scope as the outer block.  In the error message,
     SYMBOL may be shown as "'(don't know)'" if the outer block is not a
     function.

'block at ADDRESS out of order'

     The symbol information for symbol scope blocks should occur in
     order of increasing addresses.  This error indicates that it does
     not do so.

     GDB does not circumvent this problem, and has trouble locating
     symbols in the source file whose symbols it is reading.  (You can
     often determine what source file is affected by specifying 'set
     verbose on'.  *Note Optional Warnings and Messages:
     Messages/Warnings.)

'bad block start address patched'

     The symbol information for a symbol scope block has a start address
     smaller than the address of the preceding source line.  This is
     known to occur in the SunOS 4.1.1 (and earlier) C compiler.

     GDB circumvents the problem by treating the symbol scope block as
     starting on the previous source line.

'bad string table offset in symbol N'

     Symbol number N contains a pointer into the string table which is
     larger than the size of the string table.

     GDB circumvents the problem by considering the symbol to have the
     name 'foo', which may cause other problems if many symbols end up
     with this name.

'unknown symbol type 0xNN'

     The symbol information contains new data types that GDB does not
     yet know how to read.  '0xNN' is the symbol type of the
     uncomprehended information, in hexadecimal.

     GDB circumvents the error by ignoring this symbol information.
     This usually allows you to debug your program, though certain
     symbols are not accessible.  If you encounter such a problem and
     feel like debugging it, you can debug 'gdb' with itself, breakpoint
     on 'complain', then go up to the function 'read_dbx_symtab' and
     examine '*bufp' to see the symbol.

'stub type has NULL name'

     GDB could not find the full definition for a struct or class.

'const/volatile indicator missing (ok if using g++ v1.x), got...'
     The symbol information for a C++ member function is missing some
     information that recent versions of the compiler should have output
     for it.

'info mismatch between compiler and debugger'

     GDB could not parse a type specification output by the compiler.

18.6 GDB Data Files
===================

GDB will sometimes read an auxiliary data file.  These files are kept in
a directory known as the "data directory".

   You can set the data directory's name, and view the name GDB is
currently using.

'set data-directory DIRECTORY'
     Set the directory which GDB searches for auxiliary data files to
     DIRECTORY.

'show data-directory'
     Show the directory GDB searches for auxiliary data files.

   You can set the default data directory by using the configure-time
'--with-gdb-datadir' option.  If the data directory is inside GDB's
configured binary prefix (set with '--prefix' or '--exec-prefix'), then
the default data directory will be updated automatically if the
installed GDB is moved to a new location.

   The data directory may also be specified with the '--data-directory'
command line option.  *Note Mode Options::.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Targets,  Next: Remote Debugging,  Prev: GDB Files,  Up: Top

19 Specifying a Debugging Target
********************************

A "target" is the execution environment occupied by your program.

   Often, GDB runs in the same host environment as your program; in that
case, the debugging target is specified as a side effect when you use
the 'file' or 'core' commands.  When you need more flexibility--for
example, running GDB on a physically separate host, or controlling a
standalone system over a serial port or a realtime system over a TCP/IP
connection--you can use the 'target' command to specify one of the
target types configured for GDB (*note Commands for Managing Targets:
Target Commands.).

   It is possible to build GDB for several different "target
architectures".  When GDB is built like that, you can choose one of the
available architectures with the 'set architecture' command.

'set architecture ARCH'
     This command sets the current target architecture to ARCH.  The
     value of ARCH can be '"auto"', in addition to one of the supported
     architectures.

'show architecture'
     Show the current target architecture.

'set processor'
'processor'
     These are alias commands for, respectively, 'set architecture' and
     'show architecture'.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Active Targets,  Next: Target Commands,  Up: Targets

19.1 Active Targets
===================

There are multiple classes of targets such as: processes, executable
files or recording sessions.  Core files belong to the process class,
making core file and process mutually exclusive.  Otherwise, GDB can
work concurrently on multiple active targets, one in each class.  This
allows you to (for example) start a process and inspect its activity,
while still having access to the executable file after the process
finishes.  Or if you start process recording (*note Reverse Execution::)
and 'reverse-step' there, you are presented a virtual layer of the
recording target, while the process target remains stopped at the
chronologically last point of the process execution.

   Use the 'core-file' and 'exec-file' commands to select a new core
file or executable target (*note Commands to Specify Files: Files.).  To
specify as a target a process that is already running, use the 'attach'
command (*note Debugging an Already-running Process: Attach.).


File: gdb.info,  Node: Target Commands,  Next: Byte Order,  Prev: Active Targets,  Up: Targets

19.2 Commands for Managing Targets
==================================

'target TYPE PARAMETERS'
     Connects the GDB host environment to a target machine or process.
     A target is typically a protocol for talking to debugging
     facilities.  You use the argument TYPE to specify the type or
     protocol of the target machine.

     Further PARAMETERS are interpreted by the target protocol, but
     typically include things like device names or host names to connect
     with, process numbers, and baud rates.

     The 'target' command does not repeat if you press <RET> again after
     executing the command.

'help target'
     Displays the names of all targets available.  To display targets
     currently selected, use either 'info target' or 'info files' (*note
     Commands to Specify Files: Files.).

'help target NAME'
     Describe a particular target, including any parameters necessary to
     select it.

'set gnutarget ARGS'
     GDB uses its own library BFD to read your files.  GDB knows whether
     it is reading an "executable", a "core", or a ".o" file; however,
     you can specify the file format with the 'set gnutarget' command.
     Unlike most 'target' commands, with 'gnutarget' the 'target' refers
     to a program, not a machine.

          _Warning:_ To specify a file format with 'set gnutarget', you
          must know the actual BFD name.

     *Note Commands to Specify Files: Files.

'show gnutarget'
     Use the 'show gnutarget' command to display what file format
     'gnutarget' is set to read.  If you have not set 'gnutarget', GDB
     will determine the file format for each file automatically, and
     'show gnutarget' displays 'The current BFD target is "auto"'.

   Here are some common targets (available, or not, depending on the GDB
configuration):

'target exec PROGRAM'
     An executable file.  'target exec PROGRAM' is the same as
     'exec-file PROGRAM'.

'target core FILENAME'
     A core dump file.  'target core FILENAME' is the same as 'core-file
     FILENAME'.

'target remote MEDIUM'
     A remote system connected to GDB via a serial line or network
     connection.  This command tells GDB to use its own remote protocol
     over MEDIUM for debugging.  *Note Remote Debugging::.

     For example, if you have a board connected to '/dev/ttya' on the
     machine running GDB, you could say:

          target remote /dev/ttya

     'target remote' supports the 'load' command.  This is only useful
     if you have some other way of getting the stub to the target
     system, and you can put it somewhere in memory where it won't get
     clobbered by the download.

'target sim [SIMARGS] ...'
     Builtin CPU simulator.  GDB includes simulators for most
     architectures.  In general,
                  target sim
                  load
                  run
     works; however, you cannot assume that a specific memory map,
     device drivers, or even basic I/O is available, although some
     simulators do provide these.  For info about any processor-specific
     simulator details, see the appropriate section in *note Embedded
     Processors: Embedded Processors.

'target native'
     Setup for local/native process debugging.  Useful to make the 'run'
     command spawn native processes (likewise 'attach', etc.) even when
     'set auto-connect-native-target' is 'off' (*note set
     auto-connect-native-target::).

   Different targets are available on different configurations of GDB;
your configuration may have more or fewer targets.

   Many remote targets require you to download the executable's code
once you've successfully established a connection.  You may wish to
control various aspects of this process.

'set hash'
     This command controls whether a hash mark '#' is displayed while
     downloading a file to the remote monitor.  If on, a hash mark is
     displayed after each S-record is successfully downloaded to the
     monitor.

'show hash'
     Show the current status of displaying the hash mark.

'set debug monitor'
     Enable or disable display of communications messages between GDB
     and the remote monitor.

'show debug monitor'
     Show the current status of displaying communications between GDB
     and the remote monitor.

'load FILENAME'
     Depending on what remote debugging facilities are configured into
     GDB, the 'load' command may be available.  Where it exists, it is
     meant to make FILENAME (an executable) available for debugging on
     the remote system--by downloading, or dynamic linking, for example.
     'load' also records the FILENAME symbol table in GDB, like the
     'add-symbol-file' command.

     If your GDB does not have a 'load' command, attempting to execute
     it gets the error message "'You can't do that when your target is
     ...'"

     The file is loaded at whatever address is specified in the
     executable.  For some object file formats, you can specify the load
     address when you link the program; for other formats, like a.out,
     the object file format specifies a fixed address.

     Depending on the remote side capabilities, GDB may be able to load
     programs into flash memory.

     'load' does not repeat if you press <RET> again after using it.

19.3 Choosing Target Byte Order
===============================

Some types of processors, such as the MIPS, PowerPC, and Renesas SH,
offer the ability to run either big-endian or little-endian byte orders.
Usually the executable or symbol will include a bit to designate the
endian-ness, and you will not need to worry about which to use.
However, you may still find it useful to adjust GDB's idea of processor
endian-ness manually.

'set endian big'
     Instruct GDB to assume the target is big-endian.

'set endian little'
     Instruct GDB to assume the target is little-endian.

'set endian auto'
     Instruct GDB to use the byte order associated with the executable.

'show endian'
     Display GDB's current idea of the target byte order.

   Note that these commands merely adjust interpretation of symbolic
data on the host, and that they have absolutely no effect on the target
system.

20 Debugging Remote Programs
****************************

If you are trying to debug a program running on a machine that cannot
run GDB in the usual way, it is often useful to use remote debugging.
For example, you might use remote debugging on an operating system
kernel, or on a small system which does not have a general purpose
operating system powerful enough to run a full-featured debugger.

   Some configurations of GDB have special serial or TCP/IP interfaces
to make this work with particular debugging targets.  In addition, GDB
comes with a generic serial protocol (specific to GDB, but not specific
to any particular target system) which you can use if you write the
remote stubs--the code that runs on the remote system to communicate
with GDB.

   Other remote targets may be available in your configuration of GDB;
use 'help target' to list them.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Connecting,  Next: File Transfer,  Up: Remote Debugging

20.1 Connecting to a Remote Target
==================================

On the GDB host machine, you will need an unstripped copy of your
program, since GDB needs symbol and debugging information.  Start up GDB
as usual, using the name of the local copy of your program as the first
argument.

   GDB can communicate with the target over a serial line, or over an IP
network using TCP or UDP.  In each case, GDB uses the same protocol for
debugging your program; only the medium carrying the debugging packets
varies.  The 'target remote' command establishes a connection to the
target.  Its arguments indicate which medium to use:

'target remote SERIAL-DEVICE'
     Use SERIAL-DEVICE to communicate with the target.  For example, to
     use a serial line connected to the device named '/dev/ttyb':

          target remote /dev/ttyb

     If you're using a serial line, you may want to give GDB the
     '--baud' option, or use the 'set serial baud' command (*note set
     serial baud: Remote Configuration.) before the 'target' command.

'target remote HOST:PORT'
'target remote tcp:HOST:PORT'
     Debug using a TCP connection to PORT on HOST.  The HOST may be
     either a host name or a numeric IP address; PORT must be a decimal
     number.  The HOST could be the target machine itself, if it is
     directly connected to the net, or it might be a terminal server
     which in turn has a serial line to the target.

     For example, to connect to port 2828 on a terminal server named
     'manyfarms':

          target remote manyfarms:2828

     If your remote target is actually running on the same machine as
     your debugger session (e.g. a simulator for your target running on
     the same host), you can omit the hostname.  For example, to connect
     to port 1234 on your local machine:

          target remote :1234

     Note that the colon is still required here.

'target remote udp:HOST:PORT'
     Debug using UDP packets to PORT on HOST.  For example, to connect
     to UDP port 2828 on a terminal server named 'manyfarms':

          target remote udp:manyfarms:2828

     When using a UDP connection for remote debugging, you should keep
     in mind that the 'U' stands for "Unreliable".  UDP can silently
     drop packets on busy or unreliable networks, which will cause havoc
     with your debugging session.

'target remote | COMMAND'
     Run COMMAND in the background and communicate with it using a pipe.
     The COMMAND is a shell command, to be parsed and expanded by the
     system's command shell, '/bin/sh'; it should expect remote protocol
     packets on its standard input, and send replies on its standard
     output.  You could use this to run a stand-alone simulator that
     speaks the remote debugging protocol, to make net connections using
     programs like 'ssh', or for other similar tricks.

     If COMMAND closes its standard output (perhaps by exiting), GDB
     will try to send it a 'SIGTERM' signal.  (If the program has
     already exited, this will have no effect.)

   Once the connection has been established, you can use all the usual
commands to examine and change data.  The remote program is already
running; you can use 'step' and 'continue', and you do not need to use
'run'.

   Whenever GDB is waiting for the remote program, if you type the
interrupt character (often 'Ctrl-c'), GDB attempts to stop the program.
This may or may not succeed, depending in part on the hardware and the
serial drivers the remote system uses.  If you type the interrupt
character once again, GDB displays this prompt:

     Interrupted while waiting for the program.
     Give up (and stop debugging it)?  (y or n)

   If you type 'y', GDB abandons the remote debugging session.  (If you
decide you want to try again later, you can use 'target remote' again to
connect once more.)  If you type 'n', GDB goes back to waiting.

'detach'
     When you have finished debugging the remote program, you can use
     the 'detach' command to release it from GDB control.  Detaching
     from the target normally resumes its execution, but the results
     will depend on your particular remote stub.  After the 'detach'
     command, GDB is free to connect to another target.

'disconnect'
     The 'disconnect' command behaves like 'detach', except that the
     target is generally not resumed.  It will wait for GDB (this
     instance or another one) to connect and continue debugging.  After
     the 'disconnect' command, GDB is again free to connect to another
     target.

'monitor CMD'
     This command allows you to send arbitrary commands directly to the
     remote monitor.  Since GDB doesn't care about the commands it sends
     like this, this command is the way to extend GDB--you can add new
     commands that only the external monitor will understand and
     implement.

20.2 Sending files to a remote system
=====================================

Some remote targets offer the ability to transfer files over the same
connection used to communicate with GDB.  This is convenient for targets
accessible through other means, e.g. GNU/Linux systems running
'gdbserver' over a network interface.  For other targets, e.g. embedded
devices with only a single serial port, this may be the only way to
upload or download files.

   Not all remote targets support these commands.

'remote put HOSTFILE TARGETFILE'
     Copy file HOSTFILE from the host system (the machine running GDB)
     to TARGETFILE on the target system.

'remote get TARGETFILE HOSTFILE'
     Copy file TARGETFILE from the target system to HOSTFILE on the host
     system.

'remote delete TARGETFILE'
     Delete TARGETFILE from the target system.

20.3 Using the 'gdbserver' Program
==================================

'gdbserver' is a control program for Unix-like systems, which allows you
to connect your program with a remote GDB via 'target remote'--but
without linking in the usual debugging stub.

   'gdbserver' is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs,
because it requires essentially the same operating-system facilities
that GDB itself does.  In fact, a system that can run 'gdbserver' to
connect to a remote GDB could also run GDB locally!  'gdbserver' is
sometimes useful nevertheless, because it is a much smaller program than
GDB itself.  It is also easier to port than all of GDB, so you may be
able to get started more quickly on a new system by using 'gdbserver'.
Finally, if you develop code for real-time systems, you may find that
the tradeoffs involved in real-time operation make it more convenient to
do as much development work as possible on another system, for example
by cross-compiling.  You can use 'gdbserver' to make a similar choice
for debugging.

   GDB and 'gdbserver' communicate via either a serial line or a TCP
connection, using the standard GDB remote serial protocol.

     _Warning:_ 'gdbserver' does not have any built-in security.  Do not
     run 'gdbserver' connected to any public network; a GDB connection
     to 'gdbserver' provides access to the target system with the same
     privileges as the user running 'gdbserver'.

20.3.1 Running 'gdbserver'
--------------------------

Run 'gdbserver' on the target system.  You need a copy of the program
you want to debug, including any libraries it requires.  'gdbserver'
does not need your program's symbol table, so you can strip the program
if necessary to save space.  GDB on the host system does all the symbol
handling.

   To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with GDB; the
name of your program; and the arguments for your program.  The usual
syntax is:

     target> gdbserver COMM PROGRAM [ ARGS ... ]

   COMM is either a device name (to use a serial line), or a TCP
hostname and portnumber, or '-' or 'stdio' to use stdin/stdout of
'gdbserver'.  For example, to debug Emacs with the argument 'foo.txt'
and communicate with GDB over the serial port '/dev/com1':

     target> gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt

   'gdbserver' waits passively for the host GDB to communicate with it.

   To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:

     target> gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt

   The only difference from the previous example is the first argument,
specifying that you are communicating with the host GDB via TCP. The
'host:2345' argument means that 'gdbserver' is to expect a TCP
connection from machine 'host' to local TCP port 2345.  (Currently, the
'host' part is ignored.)  You can choose any number you want for the
port number as long as it does not conflict with any TCP ports already
in use on the target system (for example, '23' is reserved for
'telnet').(1)  You must use the same port number with the host GDB
'target remote' command.

   The 'stdio' connection is useful when starting 'gdbserver' with ssh:

     (gdb) target remote | ssh -T hostname gdbserver - hello

   The '-T' option to ssh is provided because we don't need a remote
pty, and we don't want escape-character handling.  Ssh does this by
default when a command is provided, the flag is provided to make it
explicit.  You could elide it if you want to.

   Programs started with stdio-connected gdbserver have '/dev/null' for
'stdin', and 'stdout','stderr' are sent back to gdb for display through
a pipe connected to gdbserver.  Both 'stdout' and 'stderr' use the same
pipe.

20.3.1.1 Attaching to a Running Program
.......................................

On some targets, 'gdbserver' can also attach to running programs.  This
is accomplished via the '--attach' argument.  The syntax is:

     target> gdbserver --attach COMM PID

   PID is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't
necessary PK
     cO=Px      	   1/1.z2199to point 'gdbserver' at a binary for the running process.

   You can debug processes by name instead of process ID if your target
has the 'pidof' utility:

     target> gdbserver --attach COMM `pidof PROGRAM`

   In case more than one copy of PROGRAM is running, or PROGRAM has
multiple threads, most versions of 'pidof' support the '-s' option to
only return the first process ID.

20.3.1.2 Multi-Process Mode for 'gdbserver'
...........................................

When you connect to 'gdbserver' using 'target remote', 'gdbserver'
debugs the specified program only once.  When the program exits, or you
detach from it, GDB closes the connection and 'gdbserver' exits.

   If you connect using 'target extended-remote', 'gdbserver' enters
multi-process mode.  When the debugged program exits, or you detach from
it, GDB stays connected to 'gdbserver' even though no program is
running.  The 'run' and 'attach' commands instruct 'gdbserver' to run or
attach to a new program.  The 'run' command uses 'set remote exec-file'
(*note set remote exec-file::) to select the program to run.  Command
line arguments are supported, except for wildcard expansion and I/O
redirection (*note Arguments::).

   To start 'gdbserver' without supplying an initial command to run or
process ID to attach, use the '--multi' command line option.  Then you
can connect using 'target extended-remote' and start the program you
want to debug.

   In multi-process mode 'gdbserver' does not automatically exit unless
you use the option '--once'.  You can terminate it by using 'monitor
exit' (*note Monitor Commands for gdbserver::).  Note that the
conditions under which 'gdbserver' terminates depend on how GDB connects
to it ('target remote' or 'target extended-remote').  The '--multi'
option to 'gdbserver' has no influence on that.

20.3.1.3 TCP port allocation lifecycle of 'gdbserver'
.....................................................

This section applies only when 'gdbserver' is run to listen on a TCP
port.

   'gdbserver' normally terminates after all of its debugged processes
have terminated in 'target remote' mode.  On the other hand, for 'target
extended-remote', 'gdbserver' stays running even with no processes left.
GDB normally terminates the spawned debugged process on its exit, which
normally also terminates 'gdbserver' in the 'target remote' mode.
Therefore, when the connection drops unexpectedly, and GDB cannot ask
'gdbserver' to kill its debugged processes, 'gdbserver' stays running
even in the 'target remote' mode.

   When 'gdbserver' stays running, GDB can connect to it again later.
Such reconnecting is useful for features like *note disconnected
tracing::.  For completeness, at most one GDB can be connected at a
time.

   By default, 'gdbserver' keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
subsequent connections are possible.  However, if you start 'gdbserver'
with the '--once' option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first GDB session.  This
means no further connections to 'gdbserver' will be possible after the
first one.  It also means 'gdbserver' will terminate after the first
connection with remote GDB has closed, even for unexpectedly closed
connections and even in the 'target extended-remote' mode.  The '--once'
option allows reusing the same port number for connecting to multiple
instances of 'gdbserver' running on the same host, since each instance
closes its port after the first connection.

20.3.1.4 Other Command-Line Arguments for 'gdbserver'
.....................................................

The '--debug' option tells 'gdbserver' to display extra status
information about the debugging process.  The '--remote-debug' option
tells 'gdbserver' to display remote protocol debug output.  These
options are intended for 'gdbserver' development and for bug reports to
the developers.

   The '--debug-format=option1[,option2,...]' option tells 'gdbserver'
to include additional information in each output.  Possible options are:

'none'
     Turn off all extra information in debugging output.
'all'
     Turn on all extra information in debugging output.
'timestamps'
     Include a timestamp in each line of debugging output.

   Options are processed in order.  Thus, for example, if 'none' appears
last then no additional information is added to debugging output.

   The '--wrapper' option specifies a wrapper to launch programs for
debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the wrapper,
then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then '--'
indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.

   'gdbserver' runs the specified wrapper program with a combined
command line including the wrapper arguments, then the name of the
program to debug, then any arguments to the program.  The wrapper runs
until it executes your program, and then GDB gains control.

   You can use any program that eventually calls 'execve' with its
arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do this, e.g.
'env' and 'nohup'.  Any Unix shell script ending with 'exec "$@"' will
also work.

   For example, you can use 'env' to pass an environment variable to the
debugged program, without setting the variable in 'gdbserver''s
environment:

     $ gdbserver --wrapper env LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so -- :2222 ./testprog

20.3.2 Connecting to 'gdbserver'
--------------------------------

Run GDB on the host system.

   First make sure you have the necessary symbol files.  Load symbols
for your application using the 'file' command before you connect.  Use
'set sysroot' to locate target libraries (unless your GDB was compiled
with the correct sysroot using '--with-sysroot').

   The symbol file and target libraries must exactly match the
executable and libraries on the target, with one exception: the files on
the host system should not be stripped, even if the files on the target
system are.  Mismatched or missing files will lead to confusing results
during debugging.  On GNU/Linux targets, mismatched or missing files may
also prevent 'gdbserver' from debugging multi-threaded programs.

   Connect to your target (*note Connecting to a Remote Target:
Connecting.).  For TCP connections, you must start up 'gdbserver' prior
to using the 'target remote' command.  Otherwise you may get an error
whose text depends on the host system, but which usually looks something
like 'Connection refused'.  Don't use the 'load' command in GDB when
using 'gdbserver', since the program is already on the target.

20.3.3 Monitor Commands for 'gdbserver'
---------------------------------------

During a GDB session using 'gdbserver', you can use the 'monitor'
command to send special requests to 'gdbserver'.  Here are the available
commands.

'monitor help'
     List the available monitor commands.

'monitor set debug 0'
'monitor set debug 1'
     Disable or enable general debugging messages.

'monitor set remote-debug 0'
'monitor set remote-debug 1'
     Disable or enable specific debugging messages associated with the
     remote protocol (*note Remote Protocol::).

'monitor set debug-format option1[,option2,...]'
     Specify additional text to add to debugging messages.  Possible
     options are:

     'none'
          Turn off all extra information in debugging output.
     'all'
          Turn on all extra information in debugging output.
     'timestamps'
          Include a timestamp in each line of debugging output.

     Options are processed in order.  Thus, for example, if 'none'
     appears last then no additional information is added to debugging
     output.

'monitor set libthread-db-search-path [PATH]'
     When this command is issued, PATH is a colon-separated list of
     directories to search for 'libthread_db' (*note set
     libthread-db-search-path: Threads.).  If you omit PATH,
     'libthread-db-search-path' will be reset to its default value.

     The special entry '$pdir' for 'libthread-db-search-path' is not
     supported in 'gdbserver'.

'monitor exit'
     Tell gdbserver to exit immediately.  This command should be
     followed by 'disconnect' to close the debugging session.
     'gdbserver' will detach from any attached processes and kill any
     processes it created.  Use 'monitor exit' to terminate 'gdbserver'
     at the end of a multi-process mode debug session.

20.3.4 Tracepoints support in 'gdbserver'
-----------------------------------------

On some targets, 'gdbserver' supports tracepoints, fast tracepoints and
static tracepoints.

   For fast or static tracepoints to work, a special library called the
"in-process agent" (IPA), must be loaded in the inferior process.  This
library is built and distributed as an integral part of 'gdbserver'.  In
addition, support for static tracepoints requires building the
in-process agent library with static tracepoints support.  At present,
the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer, <http://lttng.org/ust>) tracing engine
is supported.  This support is automatically available if UST
development headers are found in the standard include path when
'gdbserver' is built, or if 'gdbserver' was explicitly configured using
'--with-ust' to point at such headers.  You can explicitly disable the
support using '--with-ust=no'.

   There are several ways to load the in-process agent in your program:

'Specifying it as dependency at link time'

     You can link your program dynamically with the in-process agent
     library.  On most systems, this is accomplished by adding
     '-linproctrace' to the link command.

'Using the system's preloading mechanisms'

     You can force loading the in-process agent at startup time by using
     your system's support for preloading shared libraries.  Many Unixes
     support the concept of preloading user defined libraries.  In most
     cases, you do that by specifying 'LD_PRELOAD=libinproctrace.so' in
     the environment.  See also the description of 'gdbserver''s
     '--wrapper' command line option.

'Using GDB to force loading the agent at run time'

     On some systems, you can force the inferior to load a shared
     library, by calling a dynamic loader function in the inferior that
     takes care of dynamically looking up and loading a shared library.
     On most Unix systems, the function is 'dlopen'.  You'll use the
     'call' command for that.  For example:

          (gdb) call dlopen ("libinproctrace.so", ...)

     Note that on most Unix systems, for the 'dlopen' function to be
     available, the program needs to be linked with '-ldl'.

   On systems that have a userspace dynamic loader, like most Unix
systems, when you connect to 'gdbserver' using 'target remote', you'll
find that the program is stopped at the dynamic loader's entry point,
and no shared library has been loaded in the program's address space
yet, including the in-process agent.  In that case, before being able to
use any of the fast or static tracepoints features, you need to let the
loader run and load the shared libraries.  The simplest way to do that
is to run the program to the main procedure.  E.g., if debugging a C or
C++ program, start 'gdbserver' like so:

     $ gdbserver :9999 myprogram

   Start GDB and connect to 'gdbserver' like so, and run to main:

     $ gdb myprogram
     (gdb) target remote myhost:9999
     0x00007f215893ba60 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
     (gdb) b main
     (gdb) continue

   The in-process tracing agent library should now be loaded into the
process; you can confirm it with the 'info sharedlibrary' command, which
will list 'libinproctrace.so' as loaded in the process.  You are now
ready to install fast tracepoints, list static tracepoint markers, probe
static tracepoints markers, and start tracing.

   (1) If you choose a port number that conflicts with another service,
'gdbserver' prints an error message and exits.

20.4 Remote Configuration
=========================

This section documents the configuration options available when
debugging remote programs.  For the options related to the File I/O
extensions of the remote protocol, see *note system-call-allowed:
system.

'set remoteaddresssize BITS'
     Set the maximum size of address in a memory packet to the specified
     number of bits.  GDB will mask off the address bits above that
     number, when it passes addresses to the remote target.  The default
     value is the number of bits in the target's address.

'show remoteaddresssize'
     Show the current value of remote address size in bits.

'set serial baud N'
     Set the baud rate for the remote serial I/O to N baud.  The value
     is used to set the speed of the serial port used for debugging
     remote targets.

'show serial baud'
     Show the current speed of the remote connection.

'set remotebreak'
     If set to on, GDB sends a 'BREAK' signal to the remote when you
     type 'Ctrl-c' to interrupt the program running on the remote.  If
     set to off, GDB sends the 'Ctrl-C' character instead.  The default
     is off, since most remote systems expect to see 'Ctrl-C' as the
     interrupt signal.

'show remotebreak'
     Show whether GDB sends 'BREAK' or 'Ctrl-C' to interrupt the remote
     program.

'set remoteflow on'
'set remoteflow off'
     Enable or disable hardware flow control ('RTS'/'CTS') on the serial
     port used to communicate to the remote target.

'show remoteflow'
     Show the current setting of hardware flow control.

'set remotelogbase BASE'
     Set the base (a.k.a. radix) of logging serial protocol
     communications to BASE.  Supported values of BASE are: 'ascii',
     'octal', and 'hex'.  The default is 'ascii'.

'show remotelogbase'
     Show the current setting of the radix for logging remote serial
     protocol.

'set remotelogfile FILE'
     Record remote serial communications on the named FILE.  The default
     is not to record at all.

'show remotelogfile.'
     Show the current setting of the file name on which to record the
     serial communications.

'set remotetimeout NUM'
     Set the timeout limit to wait for the remote target to respond to
     NUM seconds.  The default is 2 seconds.

'show remotetimeout'
     Show the current number of seconds to wait for the remote target
     responses.

'set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit LIMIT'
'set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit LIMIT'
     Restrict GDB to using LIMIT remote hardware breakpoint or
     watchpoints.  A limit of -1, the default, is treated as unlimited.

'set remote hardware-watchpoint-length-limit LIMIT'
     Restrict GDB to using LIMIT bytes for the maximum length of a
     remote hardware watchpoint.  A limit of -1, the default, is treated
     as unlimited.

'show remote hardware-watchpoint-length-limit'
     Show the current limit (in bytes) of the maximum length of a remote
     hardware watchpoint.

'set remote exec-file FILENAME'
'show remote exec-file'
     Select the file used for 'run' with 'target extended-remote'.  This
     should be set to a filename valid on the target system.  If it is
     not set, the target will use a default filename (e.g. the last
     program run).

'set remote interrupt-sequence'
     Allow the user to select one of 'Ctrl-C', a 'BREAK' or 'BREAK-g' as
     the sequence to the remote target in order to interrupt the
     execution.  'Ctrl-C' is a default.  Some system prefers 'BREAK'
     which is high level of serial line for some certain time.  Linux
     kernel prefers 'BREAK-g', a.k.a Magic SysRq g.  It is 'BREAK'
     signal followed by character 'g'.

'show interrupt-sequence'
     Show which of 'Ctrl-C', 'BREAK' or 'BREAK-g' is sent by GDB to
     interrupt the remote program.  'BREAK-g' is BREAK signal followed
     by 'g' and also known as Magic SysRq g.

'set remote interrupt-on-connect'
     Specify whether interrupt-sequence is sent to remote target when
     GDB connects to it.  This is mostly needed when you debug Linux
     kernel.  Linux kernel expects 'BREAK' followed by 'g' which is
     known as Magic SysRq g in order to connect GDB.

'show interrupt-on-connect'
     Show whether interrupt-sequence is sent to remote target when GDB
     connects to it.

'set tcp auto-retry on'
     Enable auto-retry for remote TCP connections.  This is useful if
     the remote debugging agent is launched in parallel with GDB; there
     is a race condition because the agent may not become ready to
     accept the connection before GDB attempts to connect.  When
     auto-retry is enabled, if the initial attempt to connect fails, GDB
     reattempts to establish the connection using the timeout specified
     by 'set tcp connect-timeout'.

'set tcp auto-retry off'
     Do not auto-retry failed TCP connections.

'show tcp auto-retry'
     Show the current auto-retry setting.

'set tcp connect-timeout SECONDS'
'set tcp connect-timeout unlimited'
     Set the timeout for establishing a TCP connection to the remote
     target to SECONDS.  The timeout affects both polling to retry
     failed connections (enabled by 'set tcp auto-retry on') and waiting
     for connections that are merely slow to complete, and represents an
     approximate cumulative value.  If SECONDS is 'unlimited', there is
     no timeout and GDB will keep attempting to establish a connection
     forever, unless interrupted with 'Ctrl-c'.  The default is 15
     seconds.

'show tcp connect-timeout'
     Show the current connection timeout setting.

   The GDB remote protocol autodetects the packets supported by your
debugging stub.  If you need to override the autodetection, you can use
these commands to enable or disable individual packets.  Each packet can
be set to 'on' (the remote target supports this packet), 'off' (the
remote target does not support this packet), or 'auto' (detect remote
target support for this packet).  They all default to 'auto'.  For more
information about each packet, see *note Remote Protocol::.

   During normal use, you should not have to use any of these commands.
If you do, that may be a bug in your remote debugging stub, or a bug in
GDB.  You may want to report the problem to the GDB developers.

   For each packet NAME, the command to enable or disable the packet is
'set remote NAME-packet'.  The available settings are:

Command Name         Remote Packet           Related Features

20.5 Implementing a Remote Stub
===============================

The stub files provided with GDB implement the target side of the
communication protocol, and the GDB side is implemented in the GDB
source file 'remote.c'.  Normally, you can simply allow these
subroutines to communicate, and ignore the details.  (If you're
implementing your own stub file, you can still ignore the details: start
with one of the existing stub files.  'sparc-stub.c' is the best
organized, and therefore the easiest to read.)

   To debug a program running on another machine (the debugging "target"
machine), you must first arrange for all the usual prerequisites for the
program to run by itself.  For example, for a C program, you need:

  1. A startup routine to set up the C runtime environment; these
     usually have a name like 'crt0'.  The startup routine may be
     supplied by your hardware supplier, or you may have to write your
     own.

  2. A C subroutine library to support your program's subroutine calls,
     notably managing input and output.

  3. A way of getting your program to the other machine--for example, a
     download program.  These are often supplied by the hardware
     manufacturer, but you may have to write your own from hardware
     documentation.

   The next step is to arrange for your program to use a serial port to
communicate with the machine where GDB is running (the "host" machine).
In general terms, the scheme looks like this:

_On the host,_
     GDB already understands how to use this protocol; when everything
     else is set up, you can simply use the 'target remote' command
     (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

_On the target,_
     you must link with your program a few special-purpose subroutines
     that implement the GDB remote serial protocol.  The file containing
     these subroutines is called a "debugging stub".

     On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program
     'gdbserver' instead of linking a stub into your program.  *Note
     Using the 'gdbserver' Program: Server, for details.

   The debugging stub is specific to the architecture of the remote
machine; for example, use 'sparc-stub.c' to debug programs on SPARC
boards.

   These working remote stubs are distributed with GDB:

'i386-stub.c'
     For Intel 386 and compatible architectures.

'm68k-stub.c'
     For Motorola 680x0 architectures.

'sh-stub.c'
     For Renesas SH architectures.

'sparc-stub.c'
     For SPARC architectures.

'sparcl-stub.c'
     For Fujitsu SPARCLITE architectures.

   The 'README' file in the GDB distribution may list other recently
added stubs.

20.5.1 What the Stub Can Do for You
-----------------------------------

The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three
subroutines:

'set_debug_traps'
     This routine arranges for 'handle_exception' to run when your
     program stops.  You must call this subroutine explicitly in your
     program's startup code.

'handle_exception'
     This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it
     explicitly--the setup code arranges for 'handle_exception' to run
     when a trap is triggered.

     'handle_exception' takes control when your program stops during
     execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates
     communications with GDB on the host machine.  This is where the
     communications protocol is implemented; 'handle_exception' acts as
     the GDB representative on the target machine.  It begins by sending
     summary information on the state of your program, then continues to
     execute, retrieving and transmitting any information GDB needs,
     until you execute a GDB command that makes your program resume; at
     that point, 'handle_exception' returns control to your own code on
     the target machine.

'breakpoint'
     Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a
     breakpoint.  Depending on the particular situation, this may be the
     only way for GDB to get control.  For instance, if your target
     machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won't need to call
     this; pressing the interrupt button transfers control to
     'handle_exception'--in effect, to GDB.  On some machines, simply
     receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap;
     again, in that situation, you don't need to call 'breakpoint' from
     your own program--simply running 'target remote' from the host GDB
     session gets control.

     Call 'breakpoint' if none of these is true, or if you simply want
     to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the
     start of your debugging session.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Bootstrapping,  Next: Debug Session,  Prev: Stub Contents,  Up: Remote Stub

20.5.2 What You Must Do for the Stub
------------------------------------

The debugging stubs that come with GDB are set up for a particular chip
architecture, but they have no information about the rest of your
debugging target machine.

   First of all you need to tell the stub how to communicate with the
serial port.

'int getDebugChar()'
     Write this subroutine to read a single character from the serial
     port.  It may be identical to 'getchar' for your target system; a
     different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you
     wish.

'void putDebugChar(int)'
     Write this subroutine to write a single character to the serial
     port.  It may be identical to 'putchar' for your target system; a
     different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you
     wish.

   If you want GDB to be able to stop your program while it is running,
you need to use an interrupt-driven serial driver, and arrange for it to
stop when it receives a '^C' ('\003', the control-C character).  That is
the character which GDB uses to tell the remote system to stop.

   Getting the debugging target to return the proper status to GDB
probably requires changes to the standard stub; one quick and dirty way
is to just execute a breakpoint instruction (the "dirty" part is that
GDB reports a 'SIGTRAP' instead of a 'SIGINT').

   Other routines you need to supply are:

'void exceptionHandler (int EXCEPTION_NUMBER, void *EXCEPTION_ADDRESS)'
     Write this function to install EXCEPTION_ADDRESS in the exception
     handling tables.  You need to do this because the stub does not
     have any way of knowing what the exception handling tables on your
     target system are like (for example, the processor's table might be
     in ROM, containing entries which point to a table in RAM).  The
     EXCEPTION_NUMBER specifies the exception which should be changed;
     its meaning is architecture-dependent (for example, different
     numbers might represent divide by zero, misaligned access, etc).
     When this exception occurs, control should be transferred directly
     to EXCEPTION_ADDRESS, and the processor state (stack, registers,
     and so on) should be just as it is when a processor exception
     occurs.  So if you want to use a jump instruction to reach
     EXCEPTION_ADDRESS, it should be a simple jump, not a jump to
     subroutine.

     For the 386, EXCEPTION_ADDRESS should be installed as an interrupt
     gate so that interrupts are masked while the handler runs.  The
     gate should be at privilege level 0 (the most privileged level).
     The SPARC and 68k stubs are able to mask interrupts themselves
     without help from 'exceptionHandler'.

'void flush_i_cache()'
     On SPARC and SPARCLITE only, write this subroutine to flush the
     instruction cache, if any, on your target machine.  If there is no
     instruction cache, this subroutine may be a no-op.

     On target machines that have instruction caches, GDB requires this
     function to make certain that the state of your program is stable.

You must also make sure this library routine is available:

'void *memset(void *, int, int)'
     This is the standard library function 'memset' that sets an area of
     memory to a known value.  If you have one of the free versions of
     'libc.a', 'memset' can be found there; otherwise, you must either
     obtain it from your hardware manufacturer, or write your own.

   If you do not use the GNU C compiler, you may need other standard
library subroutines as well; this varies from one stub to another, but
in general the stubs are likely to use any of the common library
subroutines which 'GCC' generates as inline code.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Debug Session,  Prev: Bootstrapping,  Up: Remote Stub

20.5.3 Putting it All Together
------------------------------

In summary, when your program is ready to debug, you must follow these
steps.

  1. Make sure you have defined the supporting low-level routines (*note
     What You Must Do for the Stub: Bootstrapping.):
          'getDebugChar', 'putDebugChar',
          'flush_i_cache', 'memset', 'exceptionHandler'.

  2. Insert these lines in your program's startup code, before the main
     procedure is called:

          set_debug_traps();
          breakpoint();

     On some machines, when a breakpoint trap is raised, the hardware
     automatically makes the PC point to the instruction after the
     breakpoint.  If your machine doesn't do that, you may need to
     adjust 'handle_exception' to arrange for it to return to the
     instruction after the breakpoint on this first invocation, so that
     your program doesn't keep hitting the initial breakpoint instead of
     making progress.

  3. For the 680x0 stub only, you need to provide a variable called
     'exceptionHook'.  Normally you just use:

          void (*exceptionHook)() = 0;

     but if before calling 'set_debug_traps', you set it to point to a
     function in your program, that function is called when 'GDB'
     continues after stopping on a trap (for example, bus error).  The
     function indicated by 'exceptionHook' is called with one parameter:
     an 'int' which is the exception number.

  4. Compile and link together: your program, the GDB debugging stub for
     your target architecture, and the supporting subroutines.

  5. Make sure you have a serial connection between your target machine
     and the GDB host, and identify the serial port on the host.

  6. Download your program to your target machine (or get it there by
     whatever means the manufacturer provides), and start it.

  7. Start GDB on the host, and connect to the target (*note Connecting
     to a Remote Target: Connecting.).

21 Configuration-Specific Information
*************************************

While nearly all GDB commands are available for all native and cross
versions of the debugger, there are some exceptions.  This chapter
describes things that are only available in certain configurations.

   There are three major categories of configurations: native
configurations, where the host and target are the same, embedded
operating system configurations, which are usually the same for several
different processor architectures, and bare embedded processors, which
are quite different from each other.

21.1.1 HP-UX
------------

On HP-UX systems, if you refer to a function or variable name that
begins with a dollar sign, GDB searches for a user or system name first,
before it searches for a convenience variable.


File: gdb.info,  Node: BSD libkvm Interface,  Next: SVR4 Process Information,  Prev: HP-UX,  Up: Native

21.1.2 BSD libkvm Interface
---------------------------

BSD-derived systems (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD) have a kernel memory
interface that provides a uniform interface for accessing kernel virtual
memory images, including live systems and crash dumps.  GDB uses this
interface to allow you to debug live kernels and kernel crash dumps on
many native BSD configurations.  This is implemented as a special 'kvm'
debugging target.  For debugging a live system, load the currently
running kernel into GDB and connect to the 'kvm' target:

     (gdb) target kvm

   For debugging crash dumps, provide the file name of the crash dump as
an argument:

     (gdb) target kvm /var/crash/bsd.0

   Once connected to the 'kvm' target, the following commands are
available:

'kvm pcb'
     Set current context from the "Process Control Block" (PCB) address.

'kvm proc'
     Set current context from proc address.  This command isn't
     available on modern FreeBSD systems.

21.1.3 SVR4 Process Information
-------------------------------

Many versions of SVR4 and compatible systems provide a facility called
'/proc' that can be used to examine the image of a running process using
file-system subroutines.

   If GDB is configured for an operating system with this facility, the
command 'info proc' is available to report information about the process
running your program, or about any process running on your system.  This
includes, as of this writing, GNU/Linux, OSF/1 (Digital Unix), Solaris,
and Irix, but not HP-UX, for example.

   This command may also work on core files that were created on a
system that has the '/proc' facility.

'info proc'
'info proc PROCESS-ID'
     Summarize available information about any running process.  If a
     process ID is specified by PROCESS-ID, display information about
     that process; otherwise display information about the program being
     debugged.  The summary includes the debugged process ID, the
     command line used to invoke it, its current working directory, and
     its executable file's absolute file name.

     On some systems, PROCESS-ID can be of the form '[PID]/TID' which
     specifies a certain thread ID within a process.  If the optional
     PID part is missing, it means a thread from the process being
     debugged (the leading '/' still needs to be present, or else GDB
     will interpret the number as a process ID rather than a thread ID).

'info proc cmdline'
     Show the original command line of the process.  This command is
     specific to GNU/Linux.

'info proc cwd'
     Show the current working directory of the process.  This command is
     specific to GNU/Linux.

'info proc exe'
     Show the name of executable of the process.  This command is
     specific to GNU/Linux.

'info proc mappings'
     Report the memory address space ranges accessible in the program,
     with information on whether the process has read, write, or execute
     access rights to each range.  On GNU/Linux systems, each memory
     range includes the object file which is mapped to that range,
     instead of the memory access rights to that range.

'info proc stat'
'info proc status'
     These subcommands are specific to GNU/Linux systems.  They show the
     process-related information, including the user ID and group ID;
     how many threads are there in the process; its virtual memory
     usage; the signals that are pending, blocked, and ignored; its TTY;
     its consumption of system and user time; its stack size; its 'nice'
     value; etc.  For more information, see the 'proc' man page (type
     'man 5 proc' from your shell prompt).

'info proc all'
     Show all the information about the process described under all of
     the above 'info proc' subcommands.

'set procfs-trace'
     This command enables and disables tracing of 'procfs' API calls.

'show procfs-trace'
     Show the current state of 'procfs' API call tracing.

'set procfs-file FILE'
     Tell GDB to write 'procfs' API trace to the named FILE.  GDB
     appends the trace info to the previous contents of the file.  The
     default is to display the trace on the standard output.

'show procfs-file'
     Show the file to which 'procfs' API trace is written.

'proc-trace-entry'
'proc-trace-exit'
'proc-untrace-entry'
'proc-untrace-exit'
     These commands enable and disable tracing of entries into and exits
     from the 'syscall' interface.

'info pidlist'
     For QNX Neutrino only, this command displays the list of all the
     processes and all the threads within each process.

'info meminfo'
     For QNX Neutrino only, this command displays the list of all
     mapinfos.

21.1.4 Features for Debugging DJGPP Programs
--------------------------------------------

DJGPP is a port of the GNU development tools to MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
DJGPP programs are 32-bit protected-mode programs that use the "DPMI"
(DOS Protected-Mode Interface) API to run on top of real-mode DOS
systems and their emulations.

   GDB supports native debugging of DJGPP programs, and defines a few
commands specific to the DJGPP port.  This subsection describes those
commands.

'info dos'
     This is a prefix of DJGPP-specific commands which print information
     about the target system and important OS structures.

'info dos sysinfo'
     This command displays assorted information about the underlying
     platform: the CPU type and features, the OS version and flavor, the
     DPMI version, and the available conventional and DPMI memory.

'info dos gdt'
'info dos ldt'
'info dos idt'
     These 3 commands display entries from, respectively, Global, Local,
     and Interrupt Descriptor Tables (GDT, LDT, and IDT). The descriptor
     tables are data structures which store a descriptor for each
     segment that is currently in use.  The segment's selector is an
     index into a descriptor table; the table entry for that index holds
     the descriptor's base address and limit, and its attributes and
     access rights.

     A typical DJGPP program uses 3 segments: a code segment, a data
     segment (used for both data and the stack), and a DOS segment
     (which allows access to DOS/BIOS data structures and absolute
     addresses in conventional memory).  However, the DPMI host will
     usually define additional segments in order to support the DPMI
     environment.

     These commands allow to display entries from the descriptor tables.
     Without an argument, all entries from the specified table are
     displayed.  An argument, which should be an integer expression,
     means display a single entry whose index is given by the argument.
     For example, here's a convenient way to display information about
     the debugged program's data segment:

     (gdb) info dos ldt $ds
     0x13f: base=0x11970000 limit=0x0009ffff 32-Bit Data (Read/Write, Exp-up)

     This comes in handy when you want to see whether a pointer is
     outside the data segment's limit (i.e. "garbled").

'info dos pde'
'info dos pte'
     These two commands display entries from, respectively, the Page
     Directory and the Page Tables.  Page Directories and Page Tables
     are data structures which control how virtual memory addresses are
     mapped into physical addresses.  A Page Table includes an entry for
     every page of memory that is mapped into the program's address
     space; there may be several Page Tables, each one holding up to
     4096 entries.  A Page Directory has up to 4096 entries, one each
     for every Page Table that is currently in use.

     Without an argument, 'info dos pde' displays the entire Page
     Directory, and 'info dos pte' displays all the entries in all of
     the Page Tables.  An argument, an integer expression, given to the
     'info dos pde' command means display only that entry from the Page
     Directory table.  An argument given to the 'info dos pte' command
     means display entries from a single Page Table, the one pointed to
     by the specified entry in the Page Directory.

     These commands are useful when your program uses "DMA" (Direct
     Memory Access), which needs physical addresses to program the DMA
     controller.

     These commands are supported only with some DPMI servers.

'info dos address-pte ADDR'
     This command displays the Page Table entry for a specified linear
     address.  The argument ADDR is a linear address which should
     already have the appropriate segment's base address added to it,
     because this command accepts addresses which may belong to _any_
     segment.  For example, here's how to display the Page Table entry
     for the page where a variable 'i' is stored:

     (gdb) info dos address-pte __djgpp_base_address + (char *)&i
     Page Table entry for address 0x11a00d30:
     Base=0x02698000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0xd30

     This says that 'i' is stored at offset '0xd30' from the page whose
     physical base address is '0x02698000', and shows all the attributes
     of that page.

     Note that you must cast the addresses of variables to a 'char *',
     since otherwise the value of '__djgpp_base_address', the base
     address of all variables and functions in a DJGPP program, will be
     added using the rules of C pointer arithmetics: if 'i' is declared
     an 'int', GDB will add 4 times the value of '__djgpp_base_address'
     to the address of 'i'.

     Here's another example, it displays the Page Table entry for the
     transfer buffer:

     (gdb) info dos address-pte *((unsigned *)&_go32_info_block + 3)
     Page Table entry for address 0x29110:
     Base=0x00029000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0x110

     (The '+ 3' offset is because the transfer buffer's address is the
     3rd member of the '_go32_info_block' structure.)  The output
     clearly shows that this DPMI server maps the addresses in
     conventional memory 1:1, i.e. the physical ('0x00029000' + '0x110')
     and linear ('0x29110') addresses are identical.

     This command is supported only with some DPMI servers.

   In addition to native debugging, the DJGPP port supports remote
debugging via a serial data link.  The following commands are specific
to remote serial debugging in the DJGPP port of GDB.

'set com1base ADDR'
     This command sets the base I/O port address of the 'COM1' serial
     port.

'set com1irq IRQ'
     This command sets the "Interrupt Request" ('IRQ') line to use for
     the 'COM1' serial port.

     There are similar commands 'set com2base', 'set com3irq', etc. for
     setting the port address and the 'IRQ' lines for the other 3 COM
     ports.

     The related commands 'show com1base', 'show com1irq' etc. display
     the current settings of the base address and the 'IRQ' lines used
     by the COM ports.

'info serial'
     This command prints the status of the 4 DOS serial ports.  For each
     port, it prints whether it's active or not, its I/O base address
     and IRQ number, whether it uses a 16550-style FIFO, its baudrate,
     and the counts of various errors encountered so far.

21.1.5 Features for Debugging MS Windows PE Executables
-------------------------------------------------------

GDB supports native debugging of MS Windows programs, including DLLs
with and without symbolic debugging information.

   MS-Windows programs that call 'SetConsoleMode' to switch off the
special meaning of the 'Ctrl-C' keystroke cannot be interrupted by
typing 'C-c'.  For this reason, GDB on MS-Windows supports 'C-<BREAK>'
as an alternative interrupt key sequence, which can be used to interrupt
the debuggee even if it ignores 'C-c'.

   There are various additional Cygwin-specific commands, described in
this section.  Working with DLLs that have no debugging symbols is
described in *note Non-debug DLL Symbols::.

'info w32'
     This is a prefix of MS Windows-specific commands which print
     information about the target system and important OS structures.

'info w32 selector'
     This command displays information returned by the Win32 API
     'GetThreadSelectorEntry' function.  It takes an optional argument
     that is evaluated to a long value to give the information about
     this given selector.  Without argument, this command displays
     information about the six segment registers.

'info w32 thread-information-block'
     This command displays thread specific information stored in the
     Thread Information Block (readable on the X86 CPU family using
     '$fs' selector for 32-bit programs and '$gs' for 64-bit programs).

'info dll'
     This is a Cygwin-specific alias of 'info shared'.

'dll-symbols'
     This command is deprecated and will be removed in future versions
     of GDB.  Use the 'sharedlibrary' command instead.

     This command loads symbols from a dll similarly to add-sym command
     but without the need to specify a base address.

'set cygwin-exceptions MODE'
     If MODE is 'on', GDB will break on exceptions that happen inside
     the Cygwin DLL. If MODE is 'off', GDB will delay recognition of
     exceptions, and may ignore some exceptions which seem to be caused
     by internal Cygwin DLL "bookkeeping".  This option is meant
     primarily for debugging the Cygwin DLL itself; the default value is
     'off' to avoid annoying GDB users with false 'SIGSEGV' signals.

'show cygwin-exceptions'
     Displays whether GDB will break on exceptions that happen inside
     the Cygwin DLL itself.

'set new-console MODE'
     If MODE is 'on' the debuggee will be started in a new console on
     next start.  If MODE is 'off', the debuggee will be started in the
     same console as the debugger.

'show new-console'
     Displays whether a new console is used when the debuggee is
     started.

'set new-group MODE'
     This boolean value controls whether the debuggee should start a new
     group or stay in the same group as the debugger.  This affects the
     way the Windows OS handles 'Ctrl-C'.

'show new-group'
     Displays current value of new-group boolean.

'set debugevents'
     This boolean value adds debug output concerning kernel events
     related to the debuggee seen by the debugger.  This includes events
     that signal thread and process creation and exit, DLL loading and
     unloading, console interrupts, and debugging messages produced by
     the Windows 'OutputDebugString' API call.

'set debugexec'
     This boolean value adds debug output concerning execute events
     (such as resume thread) seen by the debugger.

'set debugexceptions'
     This boolean value adds debug output concerning exceptions in the
     debuggee seen by the debugger.

'set debugmemory'
     This boolean value adds debug output concerning debuggee memory
     reads and writes by the debugger.

'set shell'
     This boolean values specifies whether the debuggee is called via a
     shell or directly (default value is on).

'show shell'
     Displays if the debuggee will be started with a shell.

* Non-debug DLL Symbols::  Support for DLLs without debugging symbols


File: gdb.info,  Node: Non-debug DLL Symbols,  Up: Cygwin Native

21.1.5.1 Support for DLLs without Debugging Symbols
...................................................

Very often on windows, some of the DLLs that your program relies on do
not include symbolic debugging information (for example,
'kernel32.dll').  When GDB doesn't recognize any debugging symbols in a
DLL, it relies on the minimal amount of symbolic information contained
in the DLL's export table.  This section describes working with such
symbols, known internally to GDB as "minimal symbols".

   Note that before the debugged program has started execution, no DLLs
will have been loaded.  The easiest way around this problem is simply to
start the program -- either by setting a breakpoint or letting the
program run once to completion.

21.1.5.2 DLL Name Prefixes
..........................

In keeping with the naming conventions used by the Microsoft debugging
tools, DLL export symbols are made available with a prefix based on the
DLL name, for instance 'KERNEL32!CreateFileA'.  The plain name is also
entered into the symbol table, so 'CreateFileA' is often sufficient.  In
some cases there will be name clashes within a program (particularly if
the executable itself includes full debugging symbols) necessitating the
use of the fully qualified name when referring to the contents of the
DLL. Use single-quotes around the name to avoid the exclamation mark
("!")  being interpreted as a language operator.

   Note that the internal name of the DLL may be all upper-case, even
though the file name of the DLL is lower-case, or vice-versa.  Since
symbols within GDB are _case-sensitive_ this may cause some confusion.
If in doubt, try the 'info functions' and 'info variables' commands or
even 'maint print msymbols' (*note Symbols::).  Here's an example:

     (gdb) info function CreateFileA
     All functions matching regular expression "CreateFileA":

     Non-debugging symbols:
     0x77e885f4  CreateFileA
     0x77e885f4  KERNEL32!CreateFileA

     (gdb) info function !
     All functions matching regular expression "!":

     Non-debugging symbols:
     0x6100114c  cygwin1!__assert
     0x61004034  cygwin1!_dll_crt0@0
     0x61004240  cygwin1!dll_crt0(per_process *)
     [etc...]

21.1.5.3 Working with Minimal Symbols
.....................................

Symbols extracted from a DLL's export table do not contain very much
type information.  All that GDB can do is guess whether a symbol refers
to a function or variable depending on the linker section that contains
the symbol.  Also note that the actual contents of the memory contained
in a DLL are not available unless the program is running.  This means
that you cannot examine the contents of a variable or disassemble a
function within a DLL without a running program.

   Variables are generally treated as pointers and dereferenced
automatically.  For this reason, it is often necessary to prefix a
variable name with the address-of operator ("&") and provide explicit
type information in the command.  Here's an example of the type of
problem:

     (gdb) print 'cygwin1!__argv'
     $1 = 268572168

     (gdb) x 'cygwin1!__argv'
     0x10021610:      "\230y\""

   And two possible solutions:

     (gdb) print ((char **)'cygwin1!__argv')[0]
     $2 = 0x22fd98 "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"

     (gdb) x/2x &'cygwin1!__argv'
     0x610c0aa8 <cygwin1!__argv>:    0x10021608      0x00000000
     (gdb) x/x 0x10021608
     0x10021608:     0x0022fd98
     (gdb) x/s 0x0022fd98
     0x22fd98:        "/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram"

   Setting a break point within a DLL is possible even before the
program starts execution.  However, under these circumstances, GDB can't
examine the initial instructions of the function in order to skip the
function's frame set-up code.  You can work around this by using "*&" to
set the breakpoint at a raw memory address:

     (gdb) break *&'python22!PyOS_Readline'
     Breakpoint 1 at 0x1e04eff0

   The author of these extensions is not entirely convinced that setting
a break point within a shared DLL like 'kernel32.dll' is completely
safe.

21.1.6 Commands Specific to GNU Hurd Systems
--------------------------------------------

This subsection describes GDB commands specific to the GNU Hurd native
debugging.

'set signals'
'set sigs'
     This command toggles the state of inferior signal interception by
     GDB.  Mach exceptions, such as breakpoint traps, are not affected
     by this command.  'sigs' is a shorthand alias for 'signals'.

'show signals'
'show sigs'
     Show the current state of intercepting inferior's signals.

'set signal-thread'
'set sigthread'
     This command tells GDB which thread is the 'libc' signal thread.
     That thread is run when a signal is delivered to a running process.
     'set sigthread' is the shorthand alias of 'set signal-thread'.

'show signal-thread'
'show sigthread'
     These two commands show which thread will run when the inferior is
     delivered a signal.

'set stopped'
     This commands tells GDB that the inferior process is stopped, as
     with the 'SIGSTOP' signal.  The stopped process can be continued by
     delivering a signal to it.

'show stopped'
     This command shows whether GDB thinks the debuggee is stopped.

'set exceptions'
     Use this command to turn off trapping of exceptions in the
     inferior.  When exception trapping is off, neither breakpoints nor
     single-stepping will work.  To restore the default, set exception
     trapping on.

'show exceptions'
     Show the current state of trapping exceptions in the inferior.

'set task pause'
     This command toggles task suspension when GDB has control.  Setting
     it to on takes effect immediately, and the task is suspended
     whenever GDB gets control.  Setting it to off will take effect the
     next time the inferior is continued.  If this option is set to off,
     you can use 'set thread default pause on' or 'set thread pause on'
     (see below) to pause individual threads.

'show task pause'
     Show the current state of task suspension.

'set task detach-suspend-count'
     This command sets the suspend count the task will be left with when
     GDB detaches from it.

'show task detach-suspend-count'
     Show the suspend count the task will be left with when detaching.

'set task exception-port'
'set task excp'
     This command sets the task exception port to which GDB will forward
     exceptions.  The argument should be the value of the "send rights"
     of the task.  'set task excp' is a shorthand alias.

'set noninvasive'
     This command switches GDB to a mode that is the least invasive as
     far as interfering with the inferior is concerned.  This is the
     same as using 'set task pause', 'set exceptions', and 'set signals'
     to values opposite to the defaults.

'info send-rights'
'info receive-rights'
'info port-rights'
'info port-sets'
'info dead-names'
'info ports'
'info psets'
     These commands display information about, respectively, send
     rights, receive rights, port rights, port sets, and dead names of a
     task.  There are also shorthand aliases: 'info ports' for 'info
     port-rights' and 'info psets' for 'info port-sets'.

'set thread pause'
     This command toggles current thread suspension when GDB has
     control.  Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the
     current thread is suspended whenever GDB gets control.  Setting it
     to off will take effect the next time the inferior is continued.
     Normally, this command has no effect, since when GDB has control,
     the whole task is suspended.  However, if you used 'set task pause
     off' (see above), this command comes in handy to suspend only the
     current thread.

'show thread pause'
     This command shows the state of current thread suspension.

'set thread run'
     This command sets whether the current thread is allowed to run.

'show thread run'
     Show whether the current thread is allowed to run.

'set thread detach-suspend-count'
     This command sets the suspend count GDB will leave on a thread when
     detaching.  This number is relative to the suspend count found by
     GDB when it notices the thread; use 'set thread
     takeover-suspend-count' to force it to an absolute value.

'show thread detach-suspend-count'
     Show the suspend count GDB will leave on the thread when detaching.

'set thread exception-port'
'set thread excp'
     Set the thread exception port to which to forward exceptions.  This
     overrides the port set by 'set task exception-port' (see above).
     'set thread excp' is the shorthand alias.

'set thread takeover-suspend-count'
     Normally, GDB's thread suspend counts are relative to the value GDB
     finds when it notices each thread.  This command changes the
     suspend counts to be absolute instead.

'set thread default'
'show thread default'
     Each of the above 'set thread' commands has a 'set thread default'
     counterpart (e.g., 'set thread default pause', 'set thread default
     exception-port', etc.).  The 'thread default' variety of commands
     sets the default thread properties for all threads; you can then
     change the properties of individual threads with the non-default
     commands.

21.1.7 Darwin
-------------

GDB provides the following commands specific to the Darwin target:

'set debug darwin NUM'
     When set to a non zero value, enables debugging messages specific
     to the Darwin support.  Higher values produce more verbose output.

'show debug darwin'
     Show the current state of Darwin messages.

'set debug mach-o NUM'
     When set to a non zero value, enables debugging messages while GDB
     is reading Darwin object files.  ("Mach-O" is the file format used
     on Darwin for object and executable files.)  Higher values produce
     more verbose output.  This is a command to diagnose problems
     internal to GDB and should not be needed in normal usage.

'show debug mach-o'
     Show the current state of Mach-O file messages.

'set mach-exceptions on'
'set mach-exceptions off'
     On Darwin, faults are first reported as a Mach exception and are
     then mapped to a Posix signal.  Use this command to turn on
     trapping of Mach exceptions in the inferior.  This might be
     sometimes useful to better understand the cause of a fault.  The
     default is off.

'show mach-exceptions'
     Show the current state of exceptions trapping.

21.2 Embedded Operating Systems
===============================

This section describes configurations involving the debugging of
embedded operating systems that are available for several different
architectures.

* Menu:

* VxWorks::                     Using GDB with VxWorks

   GDB includes the ability to debug programs running on various
real-time operating systems.


File: gdb.info,  Node: VxWorks,  Up: Embedded OS

21.2.1 Using GDB with VxWorks
-----------------------------

'target vxworks MACHINENAME'
     A VxWorks system, attached via TCP/IP. The argument MACHINENAME is
     the target system's machine name or IP address.

   On VxWorks, 'load' links FILENAME dynamically on the current target
system as well as adding its symbols in GDB.

   GDB enables developers to spawn and debug tasks running on networked
VxWorks targets from a Unix host.  Already-running tasks spawned from
the VxWorks shell can also be debugged.  GDB uses code that runs on both
the Unix host and on the VxWorks target.  The program 'gdb' is installed
and executed on the Unix host.  (It may be installed with the name
'vxgdb', to distinguish it from a GDB for debugging programs on the host
itself.)

'VxWorks-timeout ARGS'
     All VxWorks-based targets now support the option 'vxworks-timeout'.
     This option is set by the user, and ARGS represents the number of
     seconds GDB waits for responses to rpc's.  You might use this if
     your VxWorks target is a slow software simulator or is on the far
     side of a thin network line.

   The following information on connecting to VxWorks was current when
this manual was produced; newer releases of VxWorks may use revised
procedures.

   To use GDB with VxWorks, you must rebuild your VxWorks kernel to
include the remote debugging interface routines in the VxWorks library
'rdb.a'.  To do this, define 'INCLUDE_RDB' in the VxWorks configuration
file 'configAll.h' and rebuild your VxWorks kernel.  The resulting
kernel contains 'rdb.a', and spawns the source debugging task 'tRdbTask'
when VxWorks is booted.  For more information on configuring and
remaking VxWorks, see the manufacturer's manual.

   Once you have included 'rdb.a' in your VxWorks system image and set
your Unix execution search path to find GDB, you are ready to run GDB.
From your Unix host, run 'gdb' (or 'vxgdb', depending on your
installation).

   GDB comes up showing the prompt:

     (vxgdb)

* Menu:

* VxWorks Connection::          Connecting to VxWorks
* VxWorks Download::            VxWorks download
* VxWorks Attach::              Running tasks


File: gdb.info,  Node: VxWorks Connection,  Next: VxWorks Download,  Up: VxWorks

21.2.1.1 Connecting to VxWorks
..............................

The GDB command 'target' lets you connect to a VxWorks target on the
network.  To connect to a target whose host name is "'tt'", type:

     (vxgdb) target vxworks tt

   GDB displays messages like these:

     Attaching remote machine across net...
     Connected to tt.

   GDB then attempts to read the symbol tables of any object modules
loaded into the VxWorks target since it was last booted.  GDB locates
these files by searching the directories listed in the command search
path (*note Your Program's Environment: Environment.); if it fails to
find an object file, it displays a message such as:

     prog.o: No such file or directory.

   When this happens, add the appropriate directory to the search path
with the GDB command 'path', and execute the 'target' command again.

21.2.1.2 VxWorks Download
.........................

If you have connected to the VxWorks target and you want to debug an
object that has not yet been loaded, you can use the GDB 'load' command
to download a file from Unix to VxWorks incrementally.  The object file
given as an argument to the 'load' command is actually opened twice:
first by the VxWorks target in order to download the code, then by GDB
in order to read the symbol table.  This can lead to problems if the
current working directories on the two systems differ.  If both systems
have NFS mounted the same filesystems, you can avoid these problems by
using absolute paths.  Otherwise, it is simplest to set the working
directory on both systems to the directory in which the object file
resides, and then to reference the file by its name, without any path.
For instance, a program 'prog.o' may reside in 'VXPATH/vw/demo/rdb' in
VxWorks and in 'HOSTPATH/vw/demo/rdb' on the host.  To load this
program, type this on VxWorks:

     -> cd "VXPATH/vw/demo/rdb"

Then, in GDB, type:

     (vxgdb) cd HOSTPATH/vw/demo/rdb
     (vxgdb) load prog.o

   GDB displays a response similar to this:

     Reading symbol data from wherever/vw/demo/rdb/prog.o... done.

   You can also use the 'load' command to reload an object module after
editing and recompiling the corresponding source file.  Note that this
makes GDB delete all currently-defined breakpoints, auto-displays, and
convenience variables, and to clear the value history.  (This is
necessary in order to preserve the integrity of debugger's data
structures that reference the target system's symbol table.)

21.2.1.3 Running Tasks
......................

You can also attach to an existing task using the 'attach' command as
follows:

     (vxgdb) attach TASK

where TASK is the VxWorks hexadecimal task ID. The task can be running
or suspended when you attach to it.  Running tasks are suspended at the
time of attachment.

21.3.1 ARM
----------

'target rdi DEV'
     ARM Angel monitor, via RDI library interface to ADP protocol.  You
     may use this target to communicate with both boards running the
     Angel monitor, or with the EmbeddedICE JTAG debug device.

'target rdp DEV'
     ARM Demon monitor.

   GDB provides the following ARM-specific commands:

'set arm disassembler'
     This commands selects from a list of disassembly styles.  The
     '"std"' style is the standard style.

'show arm disassembler'
     Show the current disassembly style.

'set arm apcs32'
     This command toggles ARM operation mode between 32-bit and 26-bit.

'show arm apcs32'
     Display the current usage of the ARM 32-bit mode.

'set arm fpu FPUTYPE'
     This command sets the ARM floating-point unit (FPU) type.  The
     argument FPUTYPE can be one of these:

     'auto'
          Determine the FPU type by querying the OS ABI.
     'softfpa'
          Software FPU, with mixed-endian doubles on little-endian ARM
          processors.
     'fpa'
          GCC-compiled FPA co-processor.
     'softvfp'
          Software FPU with pure-endian doubles.
     'vfp'
          VFP co-processor.

'show arm fpu'
     Show the current type of the FPU.

'set arm abi'
     This command forces GDB to use the specified ABI.

'show arm abi'
     Show the currently used ABI.

'set arm fallback-mode (arm|thumb|auto)'
     GDB uses the symbol table, when available, to determine whether
     instructions are ARM or Thumb.  This command controls GDB's default
     behavior when the symbol table is not available.  The default is
     'auto', which causes GDB to use the current execution mode (from
     the 'T' bit in the 'CPSR' register).

'show arm fallback-mode'
     Show the current fallback instruction mode.

'set arm force-mode (arm|thumb|auto)'
     This command overrides use of the symbol table to determine whether
     instructions are ARM or Thumb.  The default is 'auto', which causes
     GDB to use the symbol table and then the setting of 'set arm
     fallback-mode'.

'show arm force-mode'
     Show the current forced instruction mode.

'set debug arm'
     Toggle whether to display ARM-specific debugging messages from the
     ARM target support subsystem.

'show debug arm'
     Show whether ARM-specific debugging messages are enabled.

   The following commands are available when an ARM target is debugged
using the RDI interface:

'rdilogfile [FILE]'
     Set the filename for the ADP (Angel Debugger Protocol) packet log.
     With an argument, sets the log file to the specified FILE.  With no
     argument, show the current log file name.  The default log file is
     'rdi.log'.

'rdilogenable [ARG]'
     Control logging of ADP packets.  With an argument of 1 or '"yes"'
     enables logging, with an argument 0 or '"no"' disables it.  With no
     arguments displays the current setting.  When logging is enabled,
     ADP packets exchanged between GDB and the RDI target device are
     logged to a file.

'set rdiromatzero'
     Tell GDB whether the target has ROM at address 0.  If on, vector
     catching is disabled, so that zero address can be used.  If off
     (the default), vector catching is enabled.  For this command to
     take effect, it needs to be invoked prior to the 'target rdi'
     command.

'show rdiromatzero'
     Show the current setting of ROM at zero address.

'set rdiheartbeat'
     Enable or disable RDI heartbeat packets.  It is not recommended to
     turn on this option, since it confuses ARM and EPI JTAG interface,
     as well as the Angel monitor.

'show rdiheartbeat'
     Show the setting of RDI heartbeat packets.

'target sim [SIMARGS] ...'
     The GDB ARM simulator accepts the following optional arguments.

     '--swi-support=TYPE'
          Tell the simulator which SWI interfaces to support.  The
          argument TYPE may be a comma separated list of the following
          values.  The default value is 'all'.

          'none'
          'demon'
          'angel'
          'redboot'
          'all'

21.3.2 Renesas M32R/D and M32R/SDI
----------------------------------

'target m32r DEV'
     Renesas M32R/D ROM monitor.

'target m32rsdi DEV'
     Renesas M32R SDI server, connected via parallel port to the board.

   The following GDB commands are specific to the M32R monitor:

'set download-path PATH'
     Set the default path for finding downloadable SREC files.

'show download-path'
     Show the default path for downloadable SREC files.

'set board-address ADDR'
     Set the IP address for the M32R-EVA target board.

'show board-address'
     Show the current IP address of the target board.

'set server-address ADDR'
     Set the IP address for the download server, which is the GDB's host
     machine.

'show server-address'
     Display the IP address of the download server.

'upload [FILE]'
     Upload the specified SREC FILE via the monitor's Ethernet upload
     capability.  If no FILE argument is given, the current executable
     file is uploaded.

'tload [FILE]'
     Test the 'upload' command.

   The following commands are available for M32R/SDI:

'sdireset'
     This command resets the SDI connection.

'sdistatus'
     This command shows the SDI connection status.

     Instructs the remote that M32R/Chaos debugging is to be used.

'use_debug_dma'
     Instructs the remote to use the DEBUG_DMA method of accessing
     memory.

'use_mon_code'
     Instructs the remote to use the MON_CODE method of accessing
     memory.

'use_ib_break'
     Instructs the remote to set breakpoints by IB break.

'use_dbt_break'
     Instructs the remote to set breakpoints by DBT.

File: gdb.info,  Node: MicroBlaze,  Next: MIPS Embedded,  Prev: M68K,  Up: Embedded Processors

21.3.4 MicroBlaze
-----------------

The MicroBlaze is a soft-core processor supported on various Xilinx
FPGAs, such as Spartan or Virtex series.  Boards with these processors
usually have JTAG ports which connect to a host system running the
Xilinx Embedded Development Kit (EDK) or Software Development Kit (SDK).
This host system is used to download the configuration bitstream to the
target FPGA. The Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) program
communicates with the target board using the JTAG interface and presents
a 'gdbserver' interface to the board.  By default 'xmd' uses port
'1234'.  (While it is possible to change this default port, it requires
the use of undocumented 'xmd' commands.  Contact Xilinx support if you
need to do this.)

   Use these GDB commands to connect to the MicroBlaze target processor.

'target remote :1234'
     Use this command to connect to the target if you are running GDB on
     the same system as 'xmd'.

'target remote XMD-HOST:1234'
     Use this command to connect to the target if it is connected to
     'xmd' running on a different system named XMD-HOST.

'load'
     Use this command to download a program to the MicroBlaze target.

'set debug microblaze N'
     Enable MicroBlaze-specific debugging messages if non-zero.

'show debug microblaze N'
     Show MicroBlaze-specific debugging level.


File: gdb.info,  Node: MIPS Embedded,  Next: PowerPC Embedded,  Prev: MicroBlaze,  Up: Embedded Processors

21.3.5 MIPS Embedded
--------------------

GDB can use the MIPS remote debugging protocol to talk to a MIPS board
attached to a serial line.  This is available when you configure GDB
with '--target=mips-elf'.

   Use these GDB commands to specify the connection to your target
board:

'target mips PORT'
     To run a program on the board, start up 'gdb' with the name of your
     program as the argument.  To connect to the board, use the command
     'target mips PORT', where PORT is the name of the serial port
     connected to the board.  If the program has not already been
     downloaded to the board, you may use the 'load' command to download
     it.  You can then use all the usual GDB commands.

     For example, this sequence connects to the target board through a
     serial port, and loads and runs a program called PROG through the
     debugger:

          host$ gdb PROG
          GDB is free software and ...
          (gdb) target mips /dev/ttyb
          (gdb) load PROG
          (gdb) run

'target mips HOSTNAME:PORTNUMBER'
     On some GDB host configurations, you can specify a TCP connection
     (for instance, to a serial line managed by a terminal concentrator)
     instead of a serial port, using the syntax 'HOSTNAME:PORTNUMBER'.

'target pmon PORT'
     PMON ROM monitor.

'target ddb PORT'
     NEC's DDB variant of PMON for Vr4300.

'target lsi PORT'
     LSI variant of PMON.

'target r3900 DEV'
     Densan DVE-R3900 ROM monitor for Toshiba R3900 Mips.

'target array DEV'
     Array Tech LSI33K RAID controller board.

GDB also supports these special commands for MIPS targets:

'set mipsfpu double'
'set mipsfpu single'
'set mipsfpu none'
'set mipsfpu auto'
'show mipsfpu'
     If your target board does not support the MIPS floating point
     coprocessor, you should use the command 'set mipsfpu none' (if you
     need this, you may wish to put the command in your GDB init file).
     This tells GDB how to find the return value of functions which
     return floating point values.  It also allows GDB to avoid saving
     the floating point registers when calling functions on the board.
     If you are using a floating point coprocessor with only single
     precision floating point support, as on the R4650 processor, use
     the command 'set mipsfpu single'.  The default double precision
     floating point coprocessor may be selected using 'set mipsfpu
     double'.

     In previous versions the only choices were double precision or no
     floating point, so 'set mipsfpu on' will select double precision
     and 'set mipsfpu off' will select no floating point.

     As usual, you can inquire about the 'mipsfpu' variable with 'show
     mipsfpu'.

'set timeout SECONDS'
'set retransmit-timeout SECONDS'
'show timeout'
'show retransmit-timeout'
     You can control the timeout used while waiting for a packet, in the
     MIPS remote protocol, with the 'set timeout SECONDS' command.  The
     default is 5 seconds.  Similarly, you can control the timeout used
     while waiting for an acknowledgment of a packet with the 'set
     retransmit-timeout SECONDS' command.  The default is 3 seconds.
     You can inspect both values with 'show timeout' and 'show
     retransmit-timeout'.  (These commands are _only_ available when GDB
     is configured for '--target=mips-elf'.)

     The timeout set by 'set timeout' does not apply when GDB is waiting
     for your program to stop.  In that case, GDB waits forever because
     it has no way of knowing how long the program is going to run
     before stopping.

'set syn-garbage-limit NUM'
     Limit the maximum number of characters GDB should ignore when it
     tries to synchronize with the remote target.  The default is 10
     characters.  Setting the limit to -1 means there's no limit.

'show syn-garbage-limit'
     Show the current limit on the number of characters to ignore when
     trying to synchronize with the remote system.

'set monitor-prompt PROMPT'
     Tell GDB to expect the specified PROMPT string from the remote
     monitor.  The default depends on the target:
     pmon target
          'PMON'
     ddb target
          'NEC010'
     lsi target
          'PMON>'

'show monitor-prompt'
     Show the current strings GDB expects as the prompt from the remote
     monitor.

'set monitor-warnings'
     Enable or disable monitor warnings about hardware breakpoints.
     This has effect only for the 'lsi' target.  When on, GDB will
     display warning messages whose codes are returned by the 'lsi' PMON
     monitor for breakpoint commands.

'show monitor-warnings'
     Show the current setting of printing monitor warnings.

'pmon COMMAND'
     This command allows sending an arbitrary COMMAND string to the
     monitor.  The monitor must be in debug mode for this to work.


File: gdb.info,  Node: PowerPC Embedded,  Next: PA,  Prev: MIPS Embedded,  Up: Embedded Processors

21.3.6 PowerPC Embedded
-----------------------

GDB supports using the DVC (Data Value Compare) register to implement in
hardware simple hardware watchpoint conditions of the form:

     (gdb) watch ADDRESS|VARIABLE \
       if  ADDRESS|VARIABLE == CONSTANT EXPRESSION

   The DVC register will be automatically used when GDB detects such
pattern in a condition expression, and the created watchpoint uses one
debug register (either the 'exact-watchpoints' option is on and the
variable is scalar, or the variable has a length of one byte).  This
feature is available in native GDB running on a Linux kernel version
2.6.34 or newer.

   When running on PowerPC embedded processors, GDB automatically uses
ranged hardware watchpoints, unless the 'exact-watchpoints' option is
on, in which case watchpoints using only one debug register are created
when watching variables of scalar types.

   You can create an artificial array to watch an arbitrary memory
region using one of the following commands (*note Expressions::):

     (gdb) watch *((char *) ADDRESS)@LENGTH
     (gdb) watch {char[LENGTH]} ADDRESS

   PowerPC embedded processors support masked watchpoints.  See the
discussion about the 'mask' argument in *note Set Watchpoints::.

   PowerPC embedded processors support hardware accelerated "ranged
breakpoints".  A ranged breakpoint stops execution of the inferior
whenever it executes an instruction at any address within the range it
specifies.  To set a ranged breakpoint in GDB, use the 'break-range'
command.

   GDB provides the following PowerPC-specific commands:

'break-range START-LOCATION, END-LOCATION'
     Set a breakpoint for an address range given by START-LOCATION and
     END-LOCATION, which can specify a function name, a line number, an
     offset of lines from the current line or from the start location,
     or an address of an instruction (see *note Specify Location::, for
     a list of all the possible ways to specify a LOCATION.)  The
     breakpoint will stop execution of the inferior whenever it executes
     an instruction at any address within the specified range,
     (including START-LOCATION and END-LOCATION.)

'set powerpc soft-float'
'show powerpc soft-float'
     Force GDB to use (or not use) a software floating point calling
     convention.  By default, GDB selects the calling convention based
     on the selected architecture and the provided executable file.

'set powerpc vector-abi'
'show powerpc vector-abi'
     Force GDB to use the specified calling convention for vector
     arguments and return values.  The valid options are 'auto';
     'generic', to avoid vector registers even if they are present;
     'altivec', to use AltiVec registers; and 'spe' to use SPE
     registers.  By default, GDB selects the calling convention based on
     the selected architecture and the provided executable file.

'set powerpc exact-watchpoints'
'show powerpc exact-watchpoints'
     Allow GDB to use only one debug register when watching a variable
     of scalar type, thus assuming that the variable is accessed through
     the address of its first byte.

'target dink32 DEV'
     DINK32 ROM monitor.

'target ppcbug DEV'
'target ppcbug1 DEV'
     PPCBUG ROM monitor for PowerPC.

'target sds DEV'
     SDS monitor, running on a PowerPC board (such as Motorola's ADS).

   The following commands specific to the SDS protocol are supported by
GDB:

'set sdstimeout NSEC'
     Set the timeout for SDS protocol reads to be NSEC seconds.  The
     default is 2 seconds.

'show sdstimeout'
     Show the current value of the SDS timeout.

'sds COMMAND'
     Send the specified COMMAND string to the SDS monitor.

---------------------

'target op50n DEV'

File: gdb.info,  Node: Sparclet,  Next: Sparclite,  Prev: PA,  Up: Embedded Processors

21.3.8 Tsqware Sparclet
-----------------------

GDB enables developers to debug tasks running on Sparclet targets from a
Unix host.  GDB uses code that runs on both the Unix host and on the
Sparclet target.  The program 'gdb' is installed and executed on the
Unix host.

'remotetimeout ARGS'
     GDB supports the option 'remotetimeout'.  This option is set by the
     user, and ARGS represents the number of seconds GDB waits for
     responses.

   When compiling for debugging, include the options '-g' to get debug
information and '-Ttext' to relocate the program to where you wish to
load it on the target.  You may also want to add the options '-n' or
'-N' in order to reduce the size of the sections.  Example:

     sparclet-aout-gcc prog.c -Ttext 0x12010000 -g -o prog -N

   You can use 'objdump' to verify that the addresses are what you
intended:

     sparclet-aout-objdump --headers --syms prog

   Once you have set your Unix execution search path to find GDB, you
are ready to run GDB.  From your Unix host, run 'gdb' (or
'sparclet-aout-gdb', depending on your installation).

   GDB comes up showing the prompt:

     (gdbslet)

* Menu:

* Sparclet File::                Setting the file to debug
* Sparclet Connection::          Connecting to Sparclet

21.3.8.1 Setting File to Debug
..............................

The GDB command 'file' lets you choose with program to debug.

     (gdbslet) file prog

   GDB then attempts to read the symbol table of 'prog'.  GDB locates
the file by searching the directories listed in the command search path.
If the file was compiled with debug information (option '-g'), source
files will be searched as well.  GDB locates the source files by
searching the directories listed in the directory search path (*note
Your Program's Environment: Environment.).  If it fails to find a file,
it displays a message such as:

     prog: No such file or directory.

   When this happens, add the appropriate directories to the search
paths with the GDB commands 'path' and 'dir', and execute the 'target'
command again.

21.3.8.2 Connecting to Sparclet
...............................

The GDB command 'target' lets you connect to a Sparclet target.  To
connect to a target on serial port "'ttya'", type:

     (gdbslet) target sparclet /dev/ttya
     Remote target sparclet connected to /dev/ttya
     main () at ../prog.c:3

   GDB displays messages like these:

     Connected to ttya.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Sparclet Download,  Next: Sparclet Execution,  Prev: Sparclet Connection,  Up: Sparclet

21.3.8.3 Sparclet Download
..........................

Once connected to the Sparclet target, you can use the GDB 'load'
command to download the file from the host to the target.  The file name
and load offset should be given as arguments to the 'load' command.
Since the file format is aout, the program must be loaded to the
starting address.  You can use 'objdump' to find out what this value is.
The load offset is an offset which is added to the VMA (virtual memory
address) of each of the file's sections.  For instance, if the program
'prog' was linked to text address 0x1201000, with data at 0x12010160 and
bss at 0x12010170, in GDB, type:

     (gdbslet) load prog 0x12010000
     Loading section .text, size 0xdb0 vma 0x12010000

   If the code is loaded at a different address then what the program
was linked to, you may need to use the 'section' and 'add-symbol-file'
commands to tell GDB where to map the symbol table.

commands, 'b', 'step', 'run', etc.  See the GDB manual for the list of
commands.

21.3.9 Fujitsu Sparclite
------------------------

'target sparclite DEV'
     Fujitsu sparclite boards, used only for the purpose of loading.
     You must use an additional command to debug the program.  For
     example: target remote DEV using GDB standard remote protocol.

21.3.10 Zilog Z8000
-------------------

When configured for debugging Zilog Z8000 targets, GDB includes a Z8000
simulator.

   For the Z8000 family, 'target sim' simulates either the Z8002 (the
unsegmented variant of the Z8000 architecture) or the Z8001 (the
segmented variant).  The simulator recognizes which architecture is
appropriate by inspecting the object code.

'target sim ARGS'
     Debug programs on a simulated CPU. If the simulator supports setup
     options, specify them via ARGS.

After specifying this target, you can debug programs for the simulated
CPU in the same style as programs for your host computer; use the 'file'
command to load a new program image, the 'run' command to run your
program, and so on.

   As well as making available all the usual machine registers (*note
Registers: Registers.), the Z8000 simulator provides three additional
items of information as specially named registers:

'cycles'
     Counts clock-ticks in the simulator.

'insts'
     Counts instructions run in the simulator.

'time'
     Execution time in 60ths of a second.

   You can refer to these values in GDB expressions with the usual
conventions; for example, 'b fputc if $cycles>5000' sets a conditional
breakpoint that suspends only after at least 5000 simulated clock ticks.

21.3.11 Atmel AVR
-----------------

When configured for debugging the Atmel AVR, GDB supports the following
AVR-specific commands:

'info io_registers'
     This command displays information about the AVR I/O registers.  For
     each register, GDB prints its number and value.


File: gdb.info,  Node: CRIS,  Next: Super-H,  Prev: AVR,  Up: Embedded Processors

21.3.12 CRIS
------------

When configured for debugging CRIS, GDB provides the following
CRIS-specific commands:

'set cris-version VER'
     Set the current CRIS version to VER, either '10' or '32'.  The CRIS
     version affects register names and sizes.  This command is useful
     in case autodetection of the CRIS version fails.

'show cris-version'
     Show the current CRIS version.

'set cris-dwarf2-cfi'
     Set the usage of DWARF-2 CFI for CRIS debugging.  The default is
     'on'.  Change to 'off' when using 'gcc-cris' whose version is below
     'R59'.

'show cris-dwarf2-cfi'
     Show the current state of using DWARF-2 CFI.

'set cris-mode MODE'
     Set the current CRIS mode to MODE.  It should only be changed when
     debugging in guru mode, in which case it should be set to 'guru'
     (the default is 'normal').

'show cris-mode'
     Show the current CRIS mode.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Super-H,  Prev: CRIS,  Up: Embedded Processors

21.3.13 Renesas Super-H
-----------------------

For the Renesas Super-H processor, GDB provides these commands:

'set sh calling-convention CONVENTION'
     Set the calling-convention used when calling functions from GDB.
     Allowed values are 'gcc', which is the default setting, and
     'renesas'.  With the 'gcc' setting, functions are called using the
     GCC calling convention.  If the DWARF-2 information of the called
     function specifies that the function follows the Renesas calling
     convention, the function is called using the Renesas calling
     convention.  If the calling convention is set to 'renesas', the
     Renesas calling convention is always used, regardless of the
     DWARF-2 information.  This can be used to override the default of
     'gcc' if debug information is missing, or the compiler does not
     emit the DWARF-2 calling convention entry for a function.

'show sh calling-convention'
     Show the current calling convention setting.

21.4.1 AArch64
--------------

When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, it provides the
following special commands:

'set debug aarch64'
     This command determines whether AArch64 architecture-specific
     debugging messages are to be displayed.

'show debug aarch64'
     Show whether AArch64 debugging messages are displayed.

21.4.2 x86 Architecture-specific Issues
---------------------------------------

'set struct-convention MODE'
     Set the convention used by the inferior to return 'struct's and
     'union's from functions to MODE.  Possible values of MODE are
     '"pcc"', '"reg"', and '"default"' (the default).  '"default"' or
     '"pcc"' means that 'struct's are returned on the stack, while
     '"reg"' means that a 'struct' or a 'union' whose size is 1, 2, 4,
     or 8 bytes will be returned in a register.

'show struct-convention'
     Show the current setting of the convention to return 'struct's from
     functions.

21.4.2.1 Intel(R) "Memory Protection Extensions" (MPX).
.......................................................

Memory Protection Extension (MPX) adds the bound registers 'BND0' (1)
through 'BND3'.  Bound registers store a pair of 64-bit values which are
the lower bound and upper bound.  Bounds are effective addresses or
memory locations.  The upper bounds are architecturally represented in
1's complement form.  A bound having lower bound = 0, and upper bound =
0 (1's complement of all bits set) will allow access to the entire
address space.

   'BND0' through 'BND3' are represented in GDB as 'bnd0raw' through
'bnd3raw'.  Pseudo registers 'bnd0' through 'bnd3' display the upper
bound performing the complement of one operation on the upper bound
value, i.e. when upper bound in 'bnd0raw' is 0 in the GDB 'bnd0' it will
be '0xfff...'.  In this sense it can also be noted that the upper bounds
are inclusive.

   As an example, assume that the register BND0 holds bounds for a
pointer having access allowed for the range between 0x32 and 0x71.  The
values present on bnd0raw and bnd registers are presented as follows:

     	bnd0raw = {0x32, 0xffffffff8e}
     	bnd0 = {lbound = 0x32, ubound = 0x71} : size 64

   This way the raw value can be accessed via bnd0raw...bnd3raw.  Any
change on bnd0...bnd3 or bnd0raw...bnd3raw is reflect on its
counterpart.  When the bnd0...bnd3 registers are displayed via Python,
the display includes the memory size, in bits, accessible to the
pointer.

21.4.3 Alpha
------------

See the following section.


File: gdb.info,  Node: MIPS,  Next: HPPA,  Prev: Alpha,  Up: Architectures

21.4.4 MIPS
-----------

Alpha- and MIPS-based computers use an unusual stack frame, which
sometimes requires GDB to search backward in the object code to find the
beginning of a function.

   To improve response time (especially for embedded applications, where
GDB may be restricted to a slow serial line for this search) you may
want to limit the size of this search, using one of these commands:

'set heuristic-fence-post LIMIT'
     Restrict GDB to examining at most LIMIT bytes in its search for the
     beginning of a function.  A value of 0 (the default) means there is
     no limit.  However, except for 0, the larger the limit the more
     bytes 'heuristic-fence-post' must search and therefore the longer
     it takes to run.  You should only need to use this command when
     debugging a stripped executable.

'show heuristic-fence-post'
     Display the current limit.

These commands are available _only_ when GDB is configured for debugging
programs on Alpha or MIPS processors.

   Several MIPS-specific commands are available when debugging MIPS
programs:

'set mips abi ARG'
     Tell GDB which MIPS ABI is used by the inferior.  Possible values
     of ARG are:

     'auto'
          The default ABI associated with the current binary (this is
          the default).
     'o32'
     'o64'
     'n32'
     'n64'
     'eabi32'
     'eabi64'

'show mips abi'
     Show the MIPS ABI used by GDB to debug the inferior.

'set mips compression ARG'
     Tell GDB which MIPS compressed ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
     encoding is used by the inferior.  GDB uses this for code
     disassembly and other internal interpretation purposes.  This
     setting is only referred to when no executable has been associated
     with the debugging session or the executable does not provide
     information about the encoding it uses.  Otherwise this setting is
     automatically updated from information provided by the executable.

     Possible values of ARG are 'mips16' and 'micromips'.  The default
     compressed ISA encoding is 'mips16', as executables containing
     MIPS16 code frequently are not identified as such.

     This setting is "sticky"; that is, it retains its value across
     debugging sessions until reset either explicitly with this command
     or implicitly from an executable.

     The compiler and/or assembler typically add symbol table
     annotations to identify functions compiled for the MIPS16 or
     microMIPS ISAs.  If these function-scope annotations are present,
     GDB uses them in preference to the global compressed ISA encoding
     setting.

'show mips compression'
     Show the MIPS compressed ISA encoding used by GDB to debug the
     inferior.

'set mipsfpu'
'show mipsfpu'
     *Note set mipsfpu: MIPS Embedded.

'set mips mask-address ARG'
     This command determines whether the most-significant 32 bits of
     64-bit MIPS addresses are masked off.  The argument ARG can be
     'on', 'off', or 'auto'.  The latter is the default setting, which
     lets GDB determine the correct value.

'show mips mask-address'
     Show whether the upper 32 bits of MIPS addresses are masked off or
     not.

'set remote-mips64-transfers-32bit-regs'
     This command controls compatibility with 64-bit MIPS targets that
     transfer data in 32-bit quantities.  If you have an old MIPS 64
     target that transfers 32 bits for some registers, like SR and FSR,
     and 64 bits for other registers, set this option to 'on'.

'show remote-mips64-transfers-32bit-regs'
     Show the current setting of compatibility with older MIPS 64
     targets.

'set debug mips'
     This command turns on and off debugging messages for the
     MIPS-specific target code in GDB.

'show debug mips'
     Show the current setting of MIPS debugging messages.

21.4.5 HPPA
-----------

When GDB is debugging the HP PA architecture, it provides the following
special commands:

'set debug hppa'
     This command determines whether HPPA architecture-specific
     debugging messages are to be displayed.

'show debug hppa'
     Show whether HPPA debugging messages are displayed.

'maint print unwind ADDRESS'

21.4.6 Cell Broadband Engine SPU architecture
---------------------------------------------

When GDB is debugging the Cell Broadband Engine SPU architecture, it
provides the following special commands:

'info spu event'
     Display SPU event facility status.  Shows current event mask and
     pending event status.

'info spu signal'
     Display SPU signal notification facility status.  Shows pending
     signal-control word and signal notification mode of both signal
     notification channels.

'info spu mailbox'
     Display SPU mailbox facility status.  Shows all pending entries, in
     order of processing, in each of the SPU Write Outbound, SPU Write
     Outbound Interrupt, and SPU Read Inbound mailboxes.

'info spu dma'
     Display MFC DMA status.  Shows all pending commands in the MFC DMA
     queue.  For each entry, opcode, tag, class IDs, effective and local
     store addresses and transfer size are shown.

'info spu proxydma'
     Display MFC Proxy-DMA status.  Shows all pending commands in the
     MFC Proxy-DMA queue.  For each entry, opcode, tag, class IDs,
     effective and local store addresses and transfer size are shown.

   When GDB is debugging a combined PowerPC/SPU application on the Cell
Broadband Engine, it provides in addition the following special
commands:

'set spu stop-on-load ARG'
     Set whether to stop for new SPE threads.  When set to 'on', GDB
     will give control to the user when a new SPE thread enters its
     'main' function.  The default is 'off'.

'show spu stop-on-load'
     Show whether to stop for new SPE threads.

'set spu auto-flush-cache ARG'
     Set whether to automatically flush the software-managed cache.
     When set to 'on', GDB will automatically cause the SPE
     software-managed cache to be flushed whenever SPE execution stops.
     This provides a consistent view of PowerPC memory that is accessed
     via the cache.  If an application does not use the software-managed
     cache, this option has no effect.

'show spu auto-flush-cache'
     Show whether to automatically flush the software-managed cache.

21.4.7 PowerPC
--------------

When GDB is debugging the PowerPC architecture, it provides a set of
pseudo-registers to enable inspection of 128-bit wide Decimal Floating
Point numbers stored in the floating point registers.  These values must
be stored in two consecutive registers, always starting at an even
register like 'f0' or 'f2'.

   The pseudo-registers go from '$dl0' through '$dl15', and are formed
by joining the even/odd register pairs 'f0' and 'f1' for '$dl0', 'f2'
and 'f3' for '$dl1' and so on.

   For POWER7 processors, GDB provides a set of pseudo-registers, the
64-bit wide Extended Floating Point Registers ('f32' through 'f63').

21.4.8 Nios II
--------------

When GDB is debugging the Nios II architecture, it provides the
following special commands:

'set debug nios2'
     This command turns on and off debugging messages for the Nios II
     target code in GDB.

'show debug nios2'
     Show the current setting of Nios II debugging messages.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Prompt,  Next: Editing,  Up: Controlling GDB

22.1 Prompt
===========

GDB indicates its readiness to read a command by printing a string
called the "prompt".  This string is normally '(gdb)'.  You can change
the prompt string with the 'set prompt' command.  For instance, when
debugging GDB with GDB, it is useful to change the prompt in one of the
GDB sessions so that you can always tell which one you are talking to.

   _Note:_ 'set prompt' does not add a space for you after the prompt
you set.  This allows you to set a prompt which ends in a space or a
prompt that does not.

'set prompt NEWPROMPT'
     Directs GDB to use NEWPROMPT as its prompt string henceforth.

'show prompt'
     Prints a line of the form: 'Gdb's prompt is: YOUR-PROMPT'

   Versions of GDB that ship with Python scripting enabled have prompt
extensions.  The commands for interacting with these extensions are:

'set extended-prompt PROMPT'
     Set an extended prompt that allows for substitutions.  *Note
     gdb.prompt::, for a list of escape sequences that can be used for
     substitution.  Any escape sequences specified as part of the prompt
     string are replaced with the corresponding strings each time the
     prompt is displayed.

     For example:

          set extended-prompt Current working directory: \w (gdb)

     Note that when an extended-prompt is set, it takes control of the
     PROMPT_HOOK hook.  *Note prompt_hook::, for further information.

'show extended-prompt'
     Prints the extended prompt.  Any escape sequences specified as part
     of the prompt string with 'set extended-prompt', are replaced with
     the corresponding strings each time the prompt is displayed.

22.2 Command Editing
====================

GDB reads its input commands via the "Readline" interface.  This GNU
library provides consistent behavior for programs which provide a
command line interface to the user.  Advantages are GNU Emacs-style or
"vi"-style inline editing of commands, 'csh'-like history substitution,
and a storage and recall of command history across debugging sessions.

   You may control the behavior of command line editing in GDB with the
command 'set'.

'set editing'
'set editing on'
     Enable command line editing (enabled by default).

'set editing off'
     Disable command line editing.

'show editing'
     Show whether command line editing is enabled.

   *Note Command Line Editing::, for more details about the Readline
interface.  Users unfamiliar with GNU Emacs or 'vi' are encouraged to
read that chapter.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Command History,  Next: Screen Size,  Prev: Editing,  Up: Controlling GDB

22.3 Command History
====================

GDB can keep track of the commands you type during your debugging
sessions, so that you can be certain of precisely what happened.  Use
these commands to manage the GDB command history facility.

   GDB uses the GNU History library, a part of the Readline package, to
provide the history facility.  *Note Using History Interactively::, for
the detailed description of the History library.

   To issue a command to GDB without affecting certain aspects of the
state which is seen by users, prefix it with 'server ' (*note Server
Prefix::).  This means that this command will not affect the command
history, nor will it affect GDB's notion of which command to repeat if
<RET> is pressed on a line by itself.

   The server prefix does not affect the recording of values into the
value history; to print a value without recording it into the value
history, use the 'output' command instead of the 'print' command.

   Here is the description of GDB commands related to command history.

'set history filename FNAME'
     Set the name of the GDB command history file to FNAME.  This is the
     file where GDB reads an initial command history list, and where it
     writes the command history from this session when it exits.  You
     can access this list through history expansion or through the
     history command editing characters listed below.  This file
     defaults to the value of the environment variable 'GDBHISTFILE', or
     to './.gdb_history' ('./_gdb_history' on MS-DOS) if this variable
     is not set.

'set history save'
'set history save on'
     Record command history in a file, whose name may be specified with
     the 'set history filename' command.  By default, this option is
     disabled.

'set history save off'
     Stop recording command history in a file.

'set history size SIZE'
'set history size unlimited'
     Set the number of commands which GDB keeps in its history list.
     This defaults to the value of the environment variable 'HISTSIZE',
     or to 256 if this variable is not set.  If SIZE is 'unlimited', the
     number of commands GDB keeps in the history list is unlimited.

   History expansion assigns special meaning to the character '!'.
*Note Event Designators::, for more details.

   Since '!' is also the logical not operator in C, history expansion is
off by default.  If you decide to enable history expansion with the 'set
history expansion on' command, you may sometimes need to follow '!'
(when it is used as logical not, in an expression) with a space or a tab
to prevent it from being expanded.  The readline history facilities do
not attempt substitution on the strings '!=' and '!(', even when history
expansion is enabled.

   The commands to control history expansion are:

'set history expansion on'
'set history expansion'
     Enable history expansion.  History expansion is off by default.

'set history expansion off'
     Disable history expansion.

'show history'
'show history filename'
'show history save'
'show history size'
'show history expansion'
     These commands display the state of the GDB history parameters.
     'show history' by itself displays all four states.

'show commands'
     Display the last ten commands in the command history.

'show commands N'
     Print ten commands centered on command number N.

'show commands +'
     Print ten commands just after the commands last printed.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Screen Size,  Next: Numbers,  Prev: Command History,  Up: Controlling GDB

22.4 Screen Size
================

Certain commands to GDB may produce large amounts of information output
to the screen.  To help you read all of it, GDB pauses and asks you for
input at the end of each page of output.  Type <RET> when you want to
continue the output, or 'q' to discard the remaining output.  Also, the
screen width setting determines when to wrap lines of output.  Depending
on what is being printed, GDB tries to break the line at a readable
place, rather than simply letting it overflow onto the following line.

   Normally GDB knows the size of the screen from the terminal driver
software.  For example, on Unix GDB uses the termcap data base together
with the value of the 'TERM' environment variable and the 'stty rows'
and 'stty cols' settings.  If this is not correct, you can override it
with the 'set height' and 'set width' commands:

'set height LPP'
'set height unlimited'
'show height'
'set width CPL'
'set width unlimited'
'show width'
     These 'set' commands specify a screen height of LPP lines and a
     screen width of CPL characters.  The associated 'show' commands
     display the current settings.

     If you specify a height of either 'unlimited' or zero lines, GDB
     does not pause during output no matter how long the output is.
     This is useful if output is to a file or to an editor buffer.

     Likewise, you can specify 'set width unlimited' or 'set width 0' to
     prevent GDB from wrapping its output.

'set pagination on'
'set pagination off'
     Turn the output pagination on or off; the default is on.  Turning
     pagination off is the alternative to 'set height unlimited'.  Note
     that running GDB with the '--batch' option (*note -batch: Mode
     Options.) also automatically disables pagination.

'show pagination'
     Show the current pagination mode.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Numbers,  Next: ABI,  Prev: Screen Size,  Up: Controlling GDB

22.5 Numbers
============

You can always enter numbers in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal in GDB by
the usual conventions: octal numbers begin with '0', decimal numbers end
with '.', and hexadecimal numbers begin with '0x'.  Numbers that neither
begin with '0' or '0x', nor end with a '.' are, by default, entered in
base 10; likewise, the default display for numbers--when no particular
format is specified--is base 10.  You can change the default base for
both input and output with the commands described below.

'set input-radix BASE'
     Set the default base for numeric input.  Supported choices for BASE
     are decimal 8, 10, or 16.  The base must itself be specified either
     unambiguously or using the current input radix; for example, any of

          set input-radix 012
          set input-radix 10.
          set input-radix 0xa

     sets the input base to decimal.  On the other hand, 'set
     input-radix 10' leaves the input radix unchanged, no matter what it
     was, since '10', being without any leading or trailing signs of its
     base, is interpreted in the current radix.  Thus, if the current
     radix is 16, '10' is interpreted in hex, i.e. as 16 decimal, which
     doesn't change the radix.

'set output-radix BASE'
     Set the default base for numeric display.  Supported choices for
     BASE are decimal 8, 10, or 16.  The base must itself be specified
     either unambiguously or using the current input radix.

'show input-radix'
     Display the current default base for numeric input.

'show output-radix'
     Display the current default base for numeric display.

'set radix [BASE]'
'show radix'
     These commands set and show the default base for both input and
     output of numbers.  'set radix' sets the radix of input and output
     to the same base; without an argument, it resets the radix back to
     its default value of 10.

22.6 Configuring the Current ABI
================================

GDB can determine the "ABI" (Application Binary Interface) of your
application automatically.  However, sometimes you need to override its
conclusions.  Use these commands to manage GDB's view of the current
ABI.

   One GDB configuration can debug binaries for multiple operating
system targets, either via remote debugging or native emulation.  GDB
will autodetect the "OS ABI" (Operating System ABI) in use, but you can
override its conclusion using the 'set osabi' command.  One example
where this is useful is in debugging of binaries which use an alternate
C library (e.g. UCLIBC for GNU/Linux) which does not have the same
identifying marks that the standard C library for your platform
provides.

   When GDB is debugging the AArch64 architecture, it provides a
"Newlib" OS ABI. This is useful for handling 'setjmp' and 'longjmp' when
debugging binaries that use the NEWLIB C library.  The "Newlib" OS ABI
can be selected by 'set osabi Newlib'.

'show osabi'
     Show the OS ABI currently in use.

'set osabi'
     With no argument, show the list of registered available OS ABI's.

'set osabi ABI'
     Set the current OS ABI to ABI.

   Generally, the way that an argument of type 'float' is passed to a
function depends on whether the function is prototyped.  For a
prototyped (i.e. ANSI/ISO style) function, 'float' arguments are passed
unchanged, according to the architecture's convention for 'float'.  For
unprototyped (i.e. K&R style) functions, 'float' arguments are first
promoted to type 'double' and then passed.

   Unfortunately, some forms of debug information do not reliably
indicate whether a function is prototyped.  If GDB calls a function that
is not marked as prototyped, it consults 'set coerce-float-to-double'.

'set coerce-float-to-double'
'set coerce-float-to-double on'
     Arguments of type 'float' will be promoted to 'double' when passed
     to an unprototyped function.  This is the default setting.

'set coerce-float-to-double off'
     Arguments of type 'float' will be passed directly to unprototyped
     functions.

'show coerce-float-to-double'
     Show the current setting of promoting 'float' to 'double'.

   GDB needs to know the ABI used for your program's C++ objects.  The
correct C++ ABI depends on which C++ compiler was used to build your
application.  GDB only fully supports programs with a single C++ ABI; if
your program contains code using multiple C++ ABI's or if GDB can not
identify your program's ABI correctly, you can tell GDB which ABI to
use.  Currently supported ABI's include "gnu-v2", for 'g++' versions
before 3.0, "gnu-v3", for 'g++' versions 3.0 and later, and "hpaCC" for
the HP ANSI C++ compiler.  Other C++ compilers may use the "gnu-v2" or
"gnu-v3" ABI's as well.  The default setting is "auto".

'show cp-abi'
     Show the C++ ABI currently in use.

'set cp-abi'
     With no argument, show the list of supported C++ ABI's.

'set cp-abi ABI'
'set cp-abi auto'
     Set the current C++ ABI to ABI, or return to automatic detection.

22.7 Automatically loading associated files
===========================================

GDB sometimes reads files with commands and settings automatically,
without being explicitly told so by the user.  We call this feature
"auto-loading".  While auto-loading is useful for automatically adapting
GDB to the needs of your project, it can sometimes produce unexpected
results or introduce security risks (e.g., if the file comes from
untrusted sources).

* Menu:

* Init File in the Current Directory:: 'set/show/info auto-load local-gdbinit'
* libthread_db.so.1 file::             'set/show/info auto-load libthread-db'

* Auto-loading safe path::             'set/show/info auto-load safe-path'
* Auto-loading verbose mode::          'set/show debug auto-load'

   There are various kinds of files GDB can automatically load.  In
addition to these files, GDB supports auto-loading code written in
various extension languages.  *Note Auto-loading extensions::.

   Note that loading of these associated files (including the local
'.gdbinit' file) requires accordingly configured 'auto-load safe-path'
(*note Auto-loading safe path::).

   For these reasons, GDB includes commands and options to let you
control when to auto-load files and which files should be auto-loaded.

'set auto-load off'
     Globally disable loading of all auto-loaded files.  You may want to
     use this command with the '-iex' option (*note Option
     -init-eval-command::) such as:
          $ gdb -iex "set auto-load off" untrusted-executable corefile

     Be aware that system init file (*note System-wide configuration::)
     and init files from your home directory (*note Home Directory Init
     File::) still get read (as they come from generally trusted
     directories).  To prevent GDB from auto-loading even those init
     files, use the '-nx' option (*note Mode Options::), in addition to
     'set auto-load no'.

'show auto-load'
     Show whether auto-loading of each specific 'auto-load' file(s) is
     enabled or disabled.

          (gdb) show auto-load
          gdb-scripts:  Auto-loading of canned sequences of commands scripts is on.
          libthread-db:  Auto-loading of inferior specific libthread_db is on.
          local-gdbinit:  Auto-loading of .gdbinit script from current directory
                          is on.
          python-scripts:  Auto-loading of Python scripts is on.
          safe-path:  List of directories from which it is safe to auto-load files
                      is $debugdir:$datadir/auto-load.
          scripts-directory:  List of directories from which to load auto-loaded scripts
                              is $debugdir:$datadir/auto-load.

'info auto-load'
     Print whether each specific 'auto-load' file(s) have been
     auto-loaded or not.

          (gdb) info auto-load
          gdb-scripts:
          Loaded  Script
          Yes     /home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.gdb
          libthread-db:  No auto-loaded libthread-db.
          local-gdbinit:  Local .gdbinit file "/home/user/gdb/.gdbinit" has been
                          loaded.
          python-scripts:
          Loaded  Script
          Yes     /home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.py

   These are GDB control commands for the auto-loading:

*Note set auto-load off::.           Disable auto-loading globally.
*Note show auto-load::.              Show setting of all kinds of

22.7.1 Automatically loading init file in the current directory
---------------------------------------------------------------

By default, GDB reads and executes the canned sequences of commands from
init file (if any) in the current working directory, see *note Init File
in the Current Directory during Startup::.

   Note that loading of this local '.gdbinit' file also requires
accordingly configured 'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe
path::).

'set auto-load local-gdbinit [on|off]'
     Enable or disable the auto-loading of canned sequences of commands
     (*note Sequences::) found in init file in the current directory.

'show auto-load local-gdbinit'
     Show whether auto-loading of canned sequences of commands from init
     file in the current directory is enabled or disabled.

'info auto-load local-gdbinit'
     Print whether canned sequences of commands from init file in the
     current directory have been auto-loaded.

22.7.2 Automatically loading thread debugging library
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature is currently present only on GNU/Linux native hosts.

   GDB reads in some cases thread debugging library from places specific
to the inferior (*note set libthread-db-search-path::).

   The special 'libthread-db-search-path' entry '$sdir' is processed
without checking this 'set auto-load libthread-db' switch as system
libraries have to be trusted in general.  In all other cases of
'libthread-db-search-path' entries GDB checks first if 'set auto-load
libthread-db' is enabled before trying to open such thread debugging
library.

   Note that loading of this debugging library also requires accordingly
configured 'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).

'set auto-load libthread-db [on|off]'
     Enable or disable the auto-loading of inferior specific thread
     debugging library.

'show auto-load libthread-db'
     Show whether auto-loading of inferior specific thread debugging
     library is enabled or disabled.

'info auto-load libthread-db'
     Print the list of all loaded inferior specific thread debugging
     libraries and for each such library print list of inferior PIDs
     using it.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Auto-loading safe path,  Next: Auto-loading verbose mode,  Prev: libthread_db.so.1 file,  Up: Auto-loading

22.7.3 Security restriction for auto-loading
--------------------------------------------

As the files of inferior can come from untrusted source (such as
submitted by an application user) GDB does not always load any files
automatically.  GDB provides the 'set auto-load safe-path' setting to
list directories trusted for loading files not explicitly requested by
user.  Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern.

   If the path is not set properly you will see a warning and the file
will not get loaded:

     $ ./gdb -q ./gdb
     Reading symbols from /home/user/gdb/gdb...done.
     warning: File "/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.gdb" auto-loading has been
              declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set
              to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
     warning: File "/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.py" auto-loading has been
              declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set
              to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".

To instruct GDB to go ahead and use the init files anyway, invoke GDB
like this:

     $ gdb -q -iex "set auto-load safe-path /home/user/gdb" ./gdb

   The list of trusted directories is controlled by the following
commands:

'set auto-load safe-path [DIRECTORIES]'
     Set the list of directories (and their subdirectories) trusted for
     automatic loading and execution of scripts.  You can also enter a
     specific trusted file.  Each directory can also be a shell wildcard
     pattern; wildcards do not match directory separator - see
     'FNM_PATHNAME' for system function 'fnmatch' (*note fnmatch:
     (libc)Wildcard Matching.).  If you omit DIRECTORIES, 'auto-load
     safe-path' will be reset to its default value as specified during
     GDB compilation.

     The list of directories uses path separator (':' on GNU and Unix
     systems, ';' on MS-Windows and MS-DOS) to separate directories,
     similarly to the 'PATH' environment variable.

'show auto-load safe-path'
     Show the list of directories trusted for automatic loading and
     execution of scripts.

'add-auto-load-safe-path'
     Add an entry (or list of entries) the list of directories trusted
     for automatic loading and execution of scripts.  Multiple entries
     may be delimited by the host platform path separator in use.

   This variable defaults to what '--with-auto-load-dir' has been
configured to (*note with-auto-load-dir::).  '$debugdir' and '$datadir'
substitution applies the same as for *note set auto-load
scripts-directory::.  The default 'set auto-load safe-path' value can be
also overriden by GDB configuration option '--with-auto-load-safe-path'.

   Setting this variable to '/' disables this security protection,
corresponding GDB configuration option is
'--without-auto-load-safe-path'.  This variable is supposed to be set to
the system directories writable by the system superuser only.  Users can
add their source directories in init files in their home directories
(*note Home Directory Init File::).  See also deprecated init file in
the current directory (*note Init File in the Current Directory during
Startup::).

   To force GDB to load the files it declined to load in the previous
example, you could use one of the following ways:

'~/.gdbinit': 'add-auto-load-safe-path ~/src/gdb'
     Specify this trusted directory (or a file) as additional component
     of the list.  You have to specify also any existing directories
     displayed by by 'show auto-load safe-path' (such as '/usr:/bin' in
     this example).

'gdb -iex "set auto-load safe-path /usr:/bin:~/src/gdb" ...'
     Specify this directory as in the previous case but just for a
     single GDB session.

'gdb -iex "set auto-load safe-path /" ...'
     Disable auto-loading safety for a single GDB session.  This assumes
     all the files you debug during this GDB session will come from
     trusted sources.

'./configure --without-auto-load-safe-path'
     During compilation of GDB you may disable any auto-loading safety.
     This assumes all the files you will ever debug with this GDB come
     from trusted sources.

   On the other hand you can also explicitly forbid automatic files
loading which also suppresses any such warning messages:

'gdb -iex "set auto-load no" ...'
     You can use GDB command-line option for a single GDB session.

'~/.gdbinit': 'set auto-load no'
     Disable auto-loading globally for the user (*note Home Directory
     Init File::).  While it is improbable, you could also use system
     init file instead (*note System-wide configuration::).

   This setting applies to the file names as entered by user.  If no
entry matches GDB tries as a last resort to also resolve all the file
names into their canonical form (typically resolving symbolic links) and
compare the entries again.  GDB already canonicalizes most of the
filenames on its own before starting the comparison so a canonical form
of directories is recommended to be entered.

22.7.4 Displaying files tried for auto-load
-------------------------------------------

For better visibility of all the file locations where you can place
scripts to be auto-loaded with inferior -- or to protect yourself
against accidental execution of untrusted scripts -- GDB provides a
feature for printing all the files attempted to be loaded.  Both
existing and non-existing files may be printed.

   For example the list of directories from which it is safe to
auto-load files (*note Auto-loading safe path::) applies also to
canonicalized filenames which may not be too obvious while setting it
up.

     (gdb) set debug auto-load on
     (gdb) file ~/src/t/true
     auto-load: Loading canned sequences of commands script "/tmp/true-gdb.gdb"
                for objfile "/tmp/true".
     auto-load: Updating directories of "/usr:/opt".
     auto-load: Using directory "/usr".
     auto-load: Using directory "/opt".
     warning: File "/tmp/true-gdb.gdb" auto-loading has been declined
              by your `auto-load safe-path' set to "/usr:/opt".

'set debug auto-load [on|off]'
     Set whether to print the filenames attempted to be auto-loaded.

'show debug auto-load'
     Show whether printing of the filenames attempted to be auto-loaded
     is turned on or off.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Messages/Warnings,  Next: Debugging Output,  Prev: Auto-loading,  Up: Controlling GDB

22.8 Optional Warnings and Messages
===================================

By default, GDB is silent about its inner workings.  If you are running
on a slow machine, you may want to use the 'set verbose' command.  This
makes GDB tell you when it does a lengthy internal operation, so you
will not think it has crashed.

   Currently, the messages controlled by 'set verbose' are those which
announce that the symbol table for a source file is being read; see
'symbol-file' in *note Commands to Specify Files: Files.

'set verbose on'
     Enables GDB output of certain informational messages.

'set verbose off'
     Disables GDB output of certain informational messages.

'show verbose'
     Displays whether 'set verbose' is on or off.

   By default, if GDB encounters bugs in the symbol table of an object
file, it is silent; but if you are debugging a compiler, you may find
this information useful (*note Errors Reading Symbol Files: Symbol
Errors.).

'set complaints LIMIT'
     Permits GDB to output LIMIT complaints about each type of unusual
     symbols before becoming silent about the problem.  Set LIMIT to
     zero to suppress all complaints; set it to a large number to
     prevent complaints from being suppressed.

'show complaints'
     Displays how many symbol complaints GDB is permitted to produce.

   By default, GDB is cautious, and asks what sometimes seems to be a
lot of stupid questions to confirm certain commands.  For example, if
you try to run a program which is already running:

     (gdb) run
     The program being debugged has been started already.
     Start it from the beginning? (y or n)

   If you are willing to unflinchingly face the consequences of your own
commands, you can disable this "feature":

'set confirm off'
     Disables confirmation requests.  Note that running GDB with the
     '--batch' option (*note -batch: Mode Options.) also automatically
     disables confirmation requests.

'set confirm on'
     Enables confirmation requests (the default).

'show confirm'
     Displays state of confirmation requests.

   If you need to debug user-defined commands or sourced files you may
find it useful to enable "command tracing".  In this mode each command
will be printed as it is executed, prefixed with one or more '+'
symbols, the quantity denoting the call depth of each command.

'set trace-commands on'
     Enable command tracing.
'set trace-commands off'
     Disable command tracing.
'show trace-commands'
     Display the current state of command tracing.

22.9 Optional Messages about Internal Happenings
================================================

GDB has commands that enable optional debugging messages from various
GDB subsystems; normally these commands are of interest to GDB
maintainers, or when reporting a bug.  This section documents those
commands.

'set exec-done-display'
     Turns on or off the notification of asynchronous commands'
     completion.  When on, GDB will print a message when an asynchronous
     command finishes its execution.  The default is off.
'show exec-done-display'
     Displays the current setting of asynchronous command completion
     notification.
'set debug aarch64'
     Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to ARM
     AArch64.  The default is off.
'show debug aarch64'
     Displays the current state of displaying debugging messages related
     to ARM AArch64.
'set debug arch'
     Turns on or off display of gdbarch debugging info.  The default is
     off
'show debug arch'
     Displays the current state of displaying gdbarch debugging info.
'set debug aix-solib'
     Control display of debugging messages from the AIX shared library
     support module.  The default is off.
'show debug aix-thread'
     Show the current state of displaying AIX shared library debugging
     messages.
'set debug aix-thread'
     Display debugging messages about inner workings of the AIX thread
     module.
'show debug aix-thread'
     Show the current state of AIX thread debugging info display.
'set debug check-physname'
     Check the results of the "physname" computation.  When reading
     DWARF debugging information for C++, GDB attempts to compute each
     entity's name.  GDB can do this computation in two different ways,
     depending on exactly what information is present.  When enabled,
     this setting causes GDB to compute the names both ways and display
     any discrepancies.
'show debug check-physname'
     Show the current state of "physname" checking.
'set debug coff-pe-read'
     Control display of debugging messages related to reading of COFF/PE
     exported symbols.  The default is off.
'show debug coff-pe-read'
     Displays the current state of displaying debugging messages related
     to reading of COFF/PE exported symbols.
'set debug dwarf2-die'
     Dump DWARF2 DIEs after they are read in.  The value is the number
     of nesting levels to print.  A value of zero turns off the display.
'show debug dwarf2-die'
     Show the current state of DWARF2 DIE debugging.
'set debug dwarf2-read'
     Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to reading
     DWARF debug info.  The default is 0 (off).  A value of 1 provides
     basic information.  A value greater than 1 provides more verbose
     information.
'show debug dwarf2-read'
     Show the current state of DWARF2 reader debugging.
'set debug displaced'
     Turns on or off display of GDB debugging info for the displaced
     stepping support.  The default is off.
'show debug displaced'
     Displays the current state of displaying GDB debugging info related
     to displaced stepping.
'set debug event'
     Turns on or off display of GDB event debugging info.  The default
     is off.
'show debug event'
     Displays the current state of displaying GDB event debugging info.
'set debug expression'
     Turns on or off display of debugging info about GDB expression
     parsing.  The default is off.
'show debug expression'
     Displays the current state of displaying debugging info about GDB
     expression parsing.
'set debug frame'
     Turns on or off display of GDB frame debugging info.  The default
     is off.
'show debug frame'
     Displays the current state of displaying GDB frame debugging info.
'set debug gnu-nat'
     Turns on or off debugging messages from the GNU/Hurd debug support.
'show debug gnu-nat'
     Show the current state of GNU/Hurd debugging messages.
'set debug infrun'
     Turns on or off display of GDB debugging info for running the
     inferior.  The default is off.  'infrun.c' contains GDB's runtime
     state machine used for implementing operations such as
     single-stepping the inferior.
'show debug infrun'
     Displays the current state of GDB inferior debugging.

22.10 Other Miscellaneous Settings
==================================

'set interactive-mode'
     If 'on', forces GDB to assume that GDB was started in a terminal.
     In practice, this means that GDB should wait for the user to answer
     queries generated by commands entered at the command prompt.  If
     'off', forces GDB to operate in the opposite mode, and it uses the
     default answers to all queries.  If 'auto' (the default), GDB tries
     to determine whether its standard input is a terminal, and works in
     interactive-mode if it is, non-interactively otherwise.

     In the vast majority of cases, the debugger should be able to guess
     correctly which mode should be used.  But this setting can be
     useful in certain specific cases, such as running a MinGW GDB
     inside a cygwin window.

'show interactive-mode'
     Displays whether the debugger is operating in interactive mode or
     not.

23 Extending GDB
****************

GDB provides several mechanisms for extension.  GDB also provides the
ability to automatically load extensions when it reads a file for
debugging.  This allows the user to automatically customize GDB for the
program being debugged.

* Menu:

* Sequences::                Canned Sequences of GDB Commands
* Python::                   Extending GDB using Python
* Guile::                    Extending GDB using Guile
* Auto-loading extensions::  Automatically loading extensions
* Multiple Extension Languages:: Working with multiple extension languages
* Aliases::                  Creating new spellings of existing commands

   To facilitate the use of extension languages, GDB is capable of
evaluating the contents of a file.  When doing so, GDB can recognize
which extension language is being used by looking at the filename
extension.  Files with an unrecognized filename extension are always
treated as a GDB Command Files.  *Note Command files: Command Files.

   You can control how GDB evaluates these files with the following
setting:

'set script-extension off'
     All scripts are always evaluated as GDB Command Files.

'set script-extension soft'
     The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename
     extension.  If this scripting language is supported, GDB evaluates
     the script using that language.  Otherwise, it evaluates the file
     as a GDB Command File.

'set script-extension strict'
     The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename
     extension, and evaluates the script using that language.  If the
     language is not supported, then the evaluation fails.

'show script-extension'
     Display the current value of the 'script-extension' option.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Sequences,  Next: Python,  Up: Extending GDB

23.1 Canned Sequences of Commands
=================================

Aside from breakpoint commands (*note Breakpoint Command Lists: Break
Commands.), GDB provides two ways to store sequences of commands for
execution as a unit: user-defined commands and command files.

* Menu:

* Define::             How to define your own commands
* Hooks::              Hooks for user-defined commands
* Command Files::      How to write scripts of commands to be stored in a file
* Output::             Commands for controlled output
* Auto-loading sequences::  Controlling auto-loaded command files


File: gdb.info,  Node: Define,  Next: Hooks,  Up: Sequences

23.1.1 User-defined Commands
----------------------------

A "user-defined command" is a sequence of GDB commands to which you
assign a new name as a command.  This is done with the 'define' command.
User commands may accept up to 10 arguments separated by whitespace.
Arguments are accessed within the user command via '$arg0...$arg9'.  A
trivial example:

     define adder
       print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
     end

To execute the command use:

     adder 1 2 3

This defines the command 'adder', which prints the sum of its three
arguments.  Note the arguments are text substitutions, so they may
reference variables, use complex expressions, or even perform inferior
functions calls.

   In addition, '$argc' may be used to find out how many arguments have
been passed.  This expands to a number in the range 0...10.

     define adder
       if $argc == 2
         print $arg0 + $arg1
       end
       if $argc == 3
         print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
       end
     end

'define COMMANDNAME'
     Define a command named COMMANDNAME.  If there is already a command
     by that name, you are asked to confirm that you want to redefine
     it.  The argument COMMANDNAME may be a bare command name consisting
     of letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.  It may also start
     with any predefined prefix command.  For example, 'define target
     my-target' creates a user-defined 'target my-target' command.

     The definition of the command is made up of other GDB command
     lines, which are given following the 'define' command.  The end of
     these commands is marked by a line containing 'end'.

'document COMMANDNAME'
     Document the user-defined command COMMANDNAME, so that it can be
     accessed by 'help'.  The command COMMANDNAME must already be
     defined.  This command reads lines of documentation just as
     'define' reads the lines of the command definition, ending with
     'end'.  After the 'document' command is finished, 'help' on command
     COMMANDNAME displays the documentation you have written.

     You may use the 'document' command again to change the
     documentation of a command.  Redefining the command with 'define'
     does not change the documentation.

'dont-repeat'
     Used inside a user-defined command, this tells GDB that this
     command should not be repeated when the user hits <RET> (*note
     repeat last command: Command Syntax.).

'help user-defined'
     List all user-defined commands and all python commands defined in
     class COMAND_USER. The first line of the documentation or docstring
     is included (if any).

'show user'
'show user COMMANDNAME'
     Display the GDB commands used to define COMMANDNAME (but not its
     documentation).  If no COMMANDNAME is given, display the
     definitions for all user-defined commands.  This does not work for
     user-defined python commands.

'show max-user-call-depth'
'set max-user-call-depth'
     The value of 'max-user-call-depth' controls how many recursion
     levels are allowed in user-defined commands before GDB suspects an
     infinite recursion and aborts the command.  This does not apply to
     user-defined python commands.

   In addition to the above commands, user-defined commands frequently
use control flow commands, described in *note Command Files::.

   When user-defined commands are executed, the commands of the
definition are not printed.  An error in any command stops execution of
the user-defined command.

   If used interactively, commands that would ask for confirmation
proceed without asking when used inside a user-defined command.  Many
GDB commands that normally print messages to say what they are doing
omit the messages when used in a user-defined command.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Command Files,  Prev: Define,  Up: Sequences

23.1.2 User-defined Command Hooks
---------------------------------

You may define "hooks", which are a special kind of user-defined
command.  Whenever you run the command 'foo', if the user-defined
command 'hook-foo' exists, it is executed (with no arguments) before
that command.

   A hook may also be defined which is run after the command you
executed.  Whenever you run the command 'foo', if the user-defined
command 'hookpost-foo' exists, it is executed (with no arguments) after
that command.  Post-execution hooks may exist simultaneously with
pre-execution hooks, for the same command.

   It is valid for a hook to call the command which it hooks.  If this
occurs, the hook is not re-executed, thereby avoiding infinite
recursion.

   In addition, a pseudo-command, 'stop' exists.  Defining ('hook-stop')
makes the associated commands execute every time execution stops in your
program: before breakpoint commands are run, displays are printed, or
the stack frame is printed.

   For example, to ignore 'SIGALRM' signals while single-stepping, but
treat them normally during normal execution, you could define:

     define hook-stop
     handle SIGALRM nopass
     end

     define hook-run
     handle SIGALRM pass
     end

     define hook-continue
     handle SIGALRM pass
     end

   As a further example, to hook at the beginning and end of the 'echo'
command, and to add extra text to the beginning and end of the message,
you could define:

     define hook-echo
     echo <<<---
     end

     define hookpost-echo
     echo --->>>\n
     end

     (gdb) echo Hello World
     <<<---Hello World--->>>
     (gdb)


   You can define a hook for any single-word command in GDB, but not for
command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command name,
e.g. 'backtrace' rather than 'bt'.  You can hook a multi-word command by
adding 'hook-' or 'hookpost-' to the last word of the command, e.g.
'define target hook-remote' to add a hook to 'target remote'.

   If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of
GDB commands stops and GDB issues a prompt (before the command that you
actually typed had a chance to run).

   If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command,
you get a warning from the 'define' command.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Command Files,  Next: Output,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: Sequences

23.1.3 Command Files
--------------------

A command file for GDB is a text file made of lines that are GDB
commands.  Comments (lines starting with '#') may also be included.  An
empty line in a command file does nothing; it does not mean to repeat
the last command, as it would from the terminal.

   You can request the execution of a command file with the 'source'
command.  Note that the 'source' command is also used to evaluate
scripts that are not Command Files.  The exact behavior can be
configured using the 'script-extension' setting.  *Note Extending GDB:
Extending GDB.

'source [-s] [-v] FILENAME'
     Execute the command file FILENAME.

   The lines in a command file are generally executed sequentially,
unless the order of execution is changed by one of the _flow-control
commands_ described below.  The commands are not printed as they are
executed.  An error in any command terminates execution of the command
file and control is returned to the console.

   GDB first searches for FILENAME in the current directory.  If the
file is not found there, and FILENAME does not specify a directory, then
GDB also looks for the file on the source search path (specified with
the 'directory' command); except that '$cdir' is not searched because
the compilation directory is not relevant to scripts.

   If '-s' is specified, then GDB searches for FILENAME on the search
path even if FILENAME specifies a directory.  The search is done by
appending FILENAME to each element of the search path.  So, for example,
if FILENAME is 'mylib/myscript' and the search path contains
'/home/user' then GDB will look for the script
'/home/user/mylib/myscript'.  The search is also done if FILENAME is an
absolute path.  For example, if FILENAME is '/tmp/myscript' and the
search path contains '/home/user' then GDB will look for the script
'/home/user/tmp/myscript'.  For DOS-like systems, if FILENAME contains a
drive specification, it is stripped before concatenation.  For example,
if FILENAME is 'd:myscript' and the search path contains 'c:/tmp' then
GDB will look for the script 'c:/tmp/myscript'.

   If '-v', for verbose mode, is given then GDB displays each command as
it is executed.  The option must be given before FILENAME, and is
interpreted as part of the filename anywhere else.

   Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively
proceed without asking when used in a command file.  Many GDB commands
that normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the
messages when called from command files.

   GDB also accepts command input from standard input.  In this mode,
normal output goes to standard output and error output goes to standard
error.  Errors in a command file supplied on standard input do not
terminate execution of the command file--execution continues with the
next command.

     gdb < cmds > log 2>&1

   (The syntax above will vary depending on the shell used.)  This
example will execute commands from the file 'cmds'.  All output and
errors would be directed to 'log'.

   Since commands stored on command files tend to be more general than
commands typed interactively, they frequently need to deal with
complicated situations, such as different or unexpected values of
variables and symbols, changes in how the program being debugged is
built, etc.  GDB provides a set of flow-control commands to deal with
these complexities.  Using these commands, you can write complex scripts
that loop over data structures, execute commands conditionally, etc.

'if'
'else'
     This command allows to include in your script conditionally
     executed commands.  The 'if' command takes a single argument, which
     is an expression to evaluate.  It is followed by a series of
     commands that are executed only if the expression is true (its
     value is nonzero).  There can then optionally be an 'else' line,
     followed by a series of commands that are only executed if the
     expression was false.  The end of the list is marked by a line
     containing 'end'.

'while'
     This command allows to write loops.  Its syntax is similar to 'if':
     the command takes a single argument, which is an expression to
     evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to execute, one per
     line, terminated by an 'end'.  These commands are called the "body"
     of the loop.  The commands in the body of 'while' are executed
     repeatedly as long as the expression evaluates to true.

'loop_break'
     This command exits the 'while' loop in whose body it is included.
     Execution of the script continues after that 'while's 'end' line.

'loop_continue'
     This command skips the execution of the rest of the body of
     commands in the 'while' loop in whose body it is included.
     Execution branches to the beginning of the 'while' loop, where it
     evaluates the controlling expression.

'end'
     Terminate the block of commands that are the body of 'if', 'else',
     or 'while' flow-control commands.

23.1.4 Commands for Controlled Output
-------------------------------------

During the execution of a command file or a user-defined command, normal
GDB output is suppressed; the only output that appears is what is
explicitly printed by the commands in the definition.  This section
describes three commands useful for generating exactly the output you
want.

'echo TEXT'
     Print TEXT.  Nonprinting characters can be included in TEXT using C
     escape sequences, such as '\n' to print a newline.  *No newline is
     printed unless you specify one.*  In addition to the standard C
     escape sequences, a backslash followed by a space stands for a
     space.  This is useful for displaying a string with spaces at the
     beginning or the end, since leading and trailing spaces are
     otherwise trimmed from all arguments.  To print ' and foo = ', use
     the command 'echo \ and foo = \ '.

     A backslash at the end of TEXT can be used, as in C, to continue
     the command onto subsequent lines.  For example,

          echo This is some text\n\
          which is continued\n\
          onto several lines.\n

     produces the same output as

          echo This is some text\n
          echo which is continued\n
          echo onto several lines.\n

'output EXPRESSION'
     Print the value of EXPRESSION and nothing but that value: no
     newlines, no '$NN = '.  The value is not entered in the value
     history either.  *Note Expressions: Expressions, for more
     information on expressions.

'output/FMT EXPRESSION'
     Print the value of EXPRESSION in format FMT.  You can use the same
     formats as for 'print'.  *Note Output Formats: Output Formats, for
     more information.

'printf TEMPLATE, EXPRESSIONS...'
     Print the values of one or more EXPRESSIONS under the control of
     the string TEMPLATE.  To print several values, make EXPRESSIONS be
     a comma-separated list of individual expressions, which may be
     either numbers or pointers.  Their values are printed as specified
     by TEMPLATE, exactly as a C program would do by executing the code
     below:

          printf (TEMPLATE, EXPRESSIONS...);

     As in 'C' 'printf', ordinary characters in TEMPLATE are printed
     verbatim, while "conversion specification" introduced by the '%'
     character cause subsequent EXPRESSIONS to be evaluated, their
     values converted and formatted according to type and style
     information encoded in the conversion specifications, and then
     printed.

     For example, you can print two values in hex like this:

          printf "foo, bar-foo = 0x%x, 0x%x\n", foo, bar-foo

     'printf' supports all the standard 'C' conversion specifications,
     including the flags and modifiers between the '%' character and the
     conversion letter, with the following exceptions:

        * The argument-ordering modifiers, such as '2$', are not
          supported.

        * The modifier '*' is not supported for specifying precision or
          width.

        * The ''' flag (for separation of digits into groups according
          to 'LC_NUMERIC'') is not supported.

        * The type modifiers 'hh', 'j', 't', and 'z' are not supported.

        * The conversion letter 'n' (as in '%n') is not supported.

        * The conversion letters 'a' and 'A' are not supported.

     Note that the 'll' type modifier is supported only if the
     underlying 'C' implementation used to build GDB supports the 'long
     long int' type, and the 'L' type modifier is supported only if
     'long double' type is available.

     As in 'C', 'printf' supports simple backslash-escape sequences,
     such as '\n', '\t', '\\', '\"', '\a', and '\f', that consist of
     backslash followed by a single character.  Octal and hexadecimal
     escape sequences are not supported.

     Additionally, 'printf' supports conversion specifications for DFP
     ("Decimal Floating Point") types using the following length
     modifiers together with a floating point specifier.  letters:

        * 'H' for printing 'Decimal32' types.

        * 'D' for printing 'Decimal64' types.

        * 'DD' for printing 'Decimal128' types.

     If the underlying 'C' implementation used to build GDB has support
     for the three length modifiers for DFP types, other modifiers such
     as width and precision will also be available for GDB to use.

     In case there is no such 'C' support, no additional modifiers will
     be available and the value will be printed in the standard way.

     Here's an example of printing DFP types using the above conversion
     letters:
          printf "D32: %Hf - D64: %Df - D128: %DDf\n",1.2345df,1.2E10dd,1.2E1dl

'eval TEMPLATE, EXPRESSIONS...'
     Convert the values of one or more EXPRESSIONS under the control of
     the string TEMPLATE to a command line, and call it.

23.1.5 Controlling auto-loading native GDB scripts
--------------------------------------------------

When a new object file is read (for example, due to the 'file' command,
or because the inferior has loaded a shared library), GDB will look for
the command file 'OBJFILE-gdb.gdb'.  *Note Auto-loading extensions::.

   Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled, and the list of auto-loaded
scripts can be printed.

'set auto-load gdb-scripts [on|off]'
     Enable or disable the auto-loading of canned sequences of commands
     scripts.

'show auto-load gdb-scripts'
     Show whether auto-loading of canned sequences of commands scripts
     is enabled or disabled.

'info auto-load gdb-scripts [REGEXP]'
     Print the list of all canned sequences of commands scripts that GDB
     auto-loaded.

   If REGEXP is supplied only canned sequences of commands scripts with
matching names are printed.

23.2 Extending GDB using Python
===============================

You can extend GDB using the Python programming language
(http://www.python.org/).  This feature is available only if GDB was
configured using '--with-python'.

   Python scripts used by GDB should be installed in
'DATA-DIRECTORY/python', where DATA-DIRECTORY is the data directory as
determined at GDB startup (*note Data Files::).  This directory, known
as the "python directory", is automatically added to the Python Search
Path in order to allow the Python interpreter to locate all scripts
installed at this location.

   Additionally, GDB commands and convenience functions which are
written in Python and are located in the
'DATA-DIRECTORY/python/gdb/command' or
'DATA-DIRECTORY/python/gdb/function' directories are automatically
imported when GDB starts.

* Menu:

* Python Commands::             Accessing Python from GDB.
* Python API::                  Accessing GDB from Python.

* Python modules::              Python modules provided by GDB.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Python Commands,  Next: Python API,  Up: Python

23.2.1 Python Commands
----------------------

GDB provides two commands for accessing the Python interpreter, and one
related setting:

'python-interactive [COMMAND]'
'pi [COMMAND]'
     Without an argument, the 'python-interactive' command can be used
     to start an interactive Python prompt.  To return to GDB, type the
     'EOF' character (e.g., 'Ctrl-D' on an empty prompt).

     Alternatively, a single-line Python command can be given as an
     argument and evaluated.  If the command is an expression, the
     result will be printed; otherwise, nothing will be printed.  For
     example:

          (gdb) python-interactive 2 + 3
          5

'python [COMMAND]'
'py [COMMAND]'
     The 'python' command can be used to evaluate Python code.

     If given an argument, the 'python' command will evaluate the
     argument as a Python command.  For example:

          (gdb) python print 23
          23

     If you do not provide an argument to 'python', it will act as a
     multi-line command, like 'define'.  In this case, the Python script
     is made up of subsequent command lines, given after the 'python'
     command.  This command list is terminated using a line containing
     'end'.  For example:

          (gdb) python
          Type python script
          End with a line saying just "end".
          >print 23
          >end
          23

'set python print-stack'
     By default, GDB will print only the message component of a Python
     exception when an error occurs in a Python script.  This can be
     controlled using 'set python print-stack': if 'full', then full
     Python stack printing is enabled; if 'none', then Python stack and
     message printing is disabled; if 'message', the default, only the
     message component of the error is printed.

   It is also possible to execute a Python script from the GDB
interpreter:

'source script-name'
     The script name must end with '.py' and GDB must be configured to
     recognize the script language based on filename extension using the
     'script-extension' setting.  *Note Extending GDB: Extending GDB.

'python execfile ("script-name")'
     This method is based on the 'execfile' Python built-in function,
     and thus is always available.

23.2.2 Python API
-----------------

You can get quick online help for GDB's Python API by issuing the
command 'python help (gdb)'.

   Functions and methods which have two or more optional arguments allow
them to be specified using keyword syntax.  This allows passing some
optional arguments while skipping others.  Example:
'gdb.some_function ('foo', bar = 1, baz = 2)'.

23.2.2.1 Basic Python
.....................

At startup, GDB overrides Python's 'sys.stdout' and 'sys.stderr' to
print using GDB's output-paging streams.  A Python program which outputs
to one of these streams may have its output interrupted by the user
(*note Screen Size::).  In this situation, a Python 'KeyboardInterrupt'
exception is thrown.

   Some care must be taken when writing Python code to run in GDB.  Two
things worth noting in particular:

   * GDB install handlers for 'SIGCHLD' and 'SIGINT'.  Python code must
     not override these, or even change the options using 'sigaction'.
     If your program changes the handling of these signals, GDB will
     most likely stop working correctly.  Note that it is unfortunately
     common for GUI toolkits to install a 'SIGCHLD' handler.

   * GDB takes care to mark its internal file descriptors as
     close-on-exec.  However, this cannot be done in a thread-safe way
     on all platforms.  Your Python programs should be aware of this and
     should both create new file descriptors with the close-on-exec flag
     set and arrange to close unneeded file descriptors before starting
     a child process.

   GDB introduces a new Python module, named 'gdb'.  All methods and
classes added by GDB are placed in this module.  GDB automatically
'import's the 'gdb' module for use in all scripts evaluated by the
'python' command.

 -- Variable: gdb.PYTHONDIR
     A string containing the python directory (*note Python::).

 -- Function: gdb.execute (command [, from_tty [, to_string]])
     Evaluate COMMAND, a string, as a GDB CLI command.  If a GDB
     exception happens while COMMAND runs, it is translated as described
     in *note Exception Handling: Exception Handling.

     The FROM_TTY flag specifies whether GDB ought to consider this
     command as having originated from the user invoking it
     interactively.  It must be a boolean value.  If omitted, it
     defaults to 'False'.

     By default, any output produced by COMMAND is sent to GDB's
     standard output (and to the log output if logging is turned on).
     If the TO_STRING parameter is 'True', then output will be collected
     by 'gdb.execute' and returned as a string.  The default is 'False',
     in which case the return value is 'None'.  If TO_STRING is 'True',
     the GDB virtual terminal will be temporarily set to unlimited width
     and height, and its pagination will be disabled; *note Screen
     Size::.

 -- Function: gdb.breakpoints ()
     Return a sequence holding all of GDB's breakpoints.  *Note
     Breakpoints In Python::, for more information.

 -- Function: gdb.parameter (parameter)
     Return the value of a GDB PARAMETER given by its name, a string;
     the parameter name string may contain spaces if the parameter has a
     multi-part name.  For example, 'print object' is a valid parameter
     name.

     If the named parameter does not exist, this function throws a
     'gdb.error' (*note Exception Handling::).  Otherwise, the
     parameter's value is converted to a Python value of the appropriate
     type, and returned.

 -- Function: gdb.history (number)
     Return a value from GDB's value history (*note Value History::).
     The NUMBER argument indicates which history element to return.  If
     NUMBER is negative, then GDB will take its absolute value and count
     backward from the last element (i.e., the most recent element) to
     find the value to return.  If NUMBER is zero, then GDB will return
     the most recent element.  If the element specified by NUMBER
     doesn't exist in the value history, a 'gdb.error' exception will be
     raised.

     If no exception is raised, the return value is always an instance
     of 'gdb.Value' (*note Values From Inferior::).

 -- Function: gdb.parse_and_eval (expression)
     Parse EXPRESSION, which must be a string, as an expression in the
     current language, evaluate it, and return the result as a
     'gdb.Value'.

     This function can be useful when implementing a new command (*note
     Commands In Python::), as it provides a way to parse the command's
     argument as an expression.  It is also useful simply to compute
     values, for example, it is the only way to get the value of a
     convenience variable (*note Convenience Vars::) as a 'gdb.Value'.

 -- Function: gdb.find_pc_line (pc)
     Return the 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object corresponding to the PC
     value.  *Note Symbol Tables In Python::.  If an invalid value of PC
     is passed as an argument, then the 'symtab' and 'line' attributes
     of the returned 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object will be 'None' and 0
     respectively.

 -- Function: gdb.post_event (event)
     Put EVENT, a callable object taking no arguments, into GDB's
     internal event queue.  This callable will be invoked at some later
     point, during GDB's event processing.  Events posted using
     'post_event' will be run in the order in which they were posted;
     however, there is no way to know when they will be processed
     relative to other events inside GDB.

     GDB is not thread-safe.  If your Python program uses multiple
     threads, you must be careful to only call GDB-specific functions in
     the GDB thread.  'post_event' ensures this.  For example:

          (gdb) python
          >import threading
          >
          >class Writer():
          > def __init__(self, message):
          >        self.message = message;
          > def __call__(self):
          >        gdb.write(self.message)
          >
          >class MyThread1 (threading.Thread):
          > def run (self):
          >        gdb.post_event(Writer("Hello "))
          >
          >class MyThread2 (threading.Thread):
          > def run (self):
          >        gdb.post_event(Writer("World\n"))
          >
          >MyThread1().start()
          >MyThread2().start()
          >end
          (gdb) Hello World

 -- Function: gdb.write (string [, stream])
     Print a string to GDB's paginated output stream.  The optional
     STREAM determines the stream to print to.  The default stream is
     GDB's standard output stream.  Possible stream values are:

     'gdb.STDOUT'
          GDB's standard output stream.

     'gdb.STDERR'
          GDB's standard error stream.

     'gdb.STDLOG'
          GDB's log stream (*note Logging Output::).

     Writing to 'sys.stdout' or 'sys.stderr' will automatically call
     this function and will automatically direct the output to the
     relevant stream.

 -- Function: gdb.flush ()
     Flush the buffer of a GDB paginated stream so that the contents are
     displayed immediately.  GDB will flush the contents of a stream
     automatically when it encounters a newline in the buffer.  The
     optional STREAM determines the stream to flush.  The default stream
     is GDB's standard output stream.  Possible stream values are:

     'gdb.STDOUT'
          GDB's standard output stream.

     'gdb.STDERR'
          GDB's standard error stream.

     'gdb.STDLOG'
          GDB's log stream (*note Logging Output::).

     Flushing 'sys.stdout' or 'sys.stderr' will automatically call this
     function for the relevant stream.

 -- Function: gdb.target_charset ()
     Return the name of the current target character set (*note
     Character Sets::).  This differs from
     'gdb.parameter('target-charset')' in that 'auto' is never returned.

 -- Function: gdb.target_wide_charset ()
     Return the name of the current target wide character set (*note
     Character Sets::).  This differs from
     'gdb.parameter('target-wide-charset')' in that 'auto' is never
     returned.

 -- Function: gdb.solib_name (address)
     Return the name of the shared library holding the given ADDRESS as
     a string, or 'None'.

 -- Function: gdb.decode_line [expression]
     Return locations of the line specified by EXPRESSION, or of the
     current line if no argument was given.  This function returns a
     Python tuple containing two elements.  The first element contains a
     string holding any unparsed section of EXPRESSION (or 'None' if the
     expression has been fully parsed).  The second element contains
     either 'None' or another tuple that contains all the locations that
     match the expression represented as 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' objects
     (*note Symbol Tables In Python::).  If EXPRESSION is provided, it
     is decoded the way that GDB's inbuilt 'break' or 'edit' commands do
     (*note Specify Location::).

 -- Function: gdb.prompt_hook (current_prompt)

     If PROMPT_HOOK is callable, GDB will call the method assigned to
     this operation before a prompt is displayed by GDB.

     The parameter 'current_prompt' contains the current GDB prompt.
     This method must return a Python string, or 'None'.  If a string is
     returned, the GDB prompt will be set to that string.  If 'None' is
     returned, GDB will continue to use the current prompt.

     Some prompts cannot be substituted in GDB.  Secondary prompts such
     as those used by readline for command input, and annotation related
     prompts are prohibited from being changed.

23.2.2.2 Exception Handling
...........................

When executing the 'python' command, Python exceptions uncaught within
the Python code are translated to calls to GDB error-reporting
mechanism.  If the command that called 'python' does not handle the
error, GDB will terminate it and print an error message containing the
Python exception name, the associated value, and the Python call stack
backtrace at the point where the exception was raised.  Example:

     (gdb) python print foo
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
     NameError: name 'foo' is not defined

   GDB errors that happen in GDB commands invoked by Python code are
converted to Python exceptions.  The type of the Python exception
depends on the error.

'gdb.error'
     This is the base class for most exceptions generated by GDB.  It is
     derived from 'RuntimeError', for compatibility with earlier
     versions of GDB.

     If an error occurring in GDB does not fit into some more specific
     category, then the generated exception will have this type.

'gdb.MemoryError'
     This is a subclass of 'gdb.error' which is thrown when an operation
     tried to access invalid memory in the inferior.

'KeyboardInterrupt'
     User interrupt (via 'C-c' or by typing 'q' at a pagination prompt)
     is translated to a Python 'KeyboardInterrupt' exception.

   In all cases, your exception handler will see the GDB error message
as its value and the Python call stack backtrace at the Python statement
closest to where the GDB error occured as the traceback.

   When implementing GDB commands in Python via 'gdb.Command', it is
useful to be able to throw an exception that doesn't cause a traceback
to be printed.  For example, the user may have invoked the command
incorrectly.  Use the 'gdb.GdbError' exception to handle this case.
Example:

     (gdb) python
     >class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
     >  """Greet the whole world."""
     >  def __init__ (self):
     >    super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ ("hello-world", gdb.COMMAND_USER)
     >  def invoke (self, args, from_tty):
     >    argv = gdb.string_to_argv (args)
     >    if len (argv) != 0:
     >      raise gdb.GdbError ("hello-world takes no arguments")
     >    print "Hello, World!"
     >HelloWorld ()
     >end
     (gdb) hello-world 42
     hello-world takes no arguments


File: gdb.info,  Node: Values From Inferior,  Next: Types In Python,  Prev: Exception Handling,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.3 Values From Inferior
.............................

GDB provides values it obtains from the inferior program in an object of
type 'gdb.Value'.  GDB uses this object for its internal bookkeeping of
the inferior's values, and for fetching values when necessary.

   Inferior values that are simple scalars can be used directly in
Python expressions that are valid for the value's data type.  Here's an
example for an integer or floating-point value 'some_val':

     bar = some_val + 2

As result of this, 'bar' will also be a 'gdb.Value' object whose values
are of the same type as those of 'some_val'.  Valid Python operations
can also be performed on 'gdb.Value' objects representing a 'struct' or
'class' object.  For such cases, the overloaded operator (if present),
is used to perform the operation.  For example, if 'val1' and 'val2' are
'gdb.Value' objects representing instances of a 'class' which overloads
the '+' operator, then one can use the '+' operator in their Python
script as follows:

     val3 = val1 + val2

The result of the operation 'val3' is also a 'gdb.Value' object
corresponding to the value returned by the overloaded '+' operator.  In
general, overloaded operators are invoked for the following operations:
'+' (binary addition), '-' (binary subtraction), '*' (multiplication),
'/', '%', '<<', '>>', '|', '&', '^'.

   Inferior values that are structures or instances of some class can be
accessed using the Python "dictionary syntax".  For example, if
'some_val' is a 'gdb.Value' instance holding a structure, you can access
its 'foo' element with:

     bar = some_val['foo']

   Again, 'bar' will also be a 'gdb.Value' object.  Structure elements
can also be accessed by using 'gdb.Field' objects as subscripts (*note
Types In Python::, for more information on 'gdb.Field' objects).  For
example, if 'foo_field' is a 'gdb.Field' object corresponding to element
'foo' of the above structure, then 'bar' can also be accessed as
follows:

     bar = some_val[foo_field]

   A 'gdb.Value' that represents a function can be executed via inferior
function call.  Any arguments provided to the call must match the
function's prototype, and must be provided in the order specified by
that prototype.

   For example, 'some_val' is a 'gdb.Value' instance representing a
function that takes two integers as arguments.  To execute this
function, call it like so:

     result = some_val (10,20)

   Any values returned from a function call will be stored as a
'gdb.Value'.

   The following attributes are provided:

 -- Variable: Value.address
     If this object is addressable, this read-only attribute holds a
     'gdb.Value' object representing the address.  Otherwise, this
     attribute holds 'None'.

 -- Variable: Value.is_optimized_out
     This read-only boolean attribute is true if the compiler optimized
     out this value, thus it is not available for fetching from the
     inferior.

 -- Variable: Value.type
     The type of this 'gdb.Value'.  The value of this attribute is a
     'gdb.Type' object (*note Types In Python::).

 -- Variable: Value.dynamic_type
     The dynamic type of this 'gdb.Value'.  This uses C++ run-time type
     information (RTTI) to determine the dynamic type of the value.  If
     this value is of class type, it will return the class in which the
     value is embedded, if any.  If this value is of pointer or
     reference to a class type, it will compute the dynamic type of the
     referenced object, and return a pointer or reference to that type,
     respectively.  In all other cases, it will return the value's
     static type.

     Note that this feature will only work when debugging a C++ program
     that includes RTTI for the object in question.  Otherwise, it will
     just return the static type of the value as in 'ptype foo' (*note
     ptype: Symbols.).

 -- Variable: Value.is_lazy
     The value of this read-only boolean attribute is 'True' if this
     'gdb.Value' has not yet been fetched from the inferior.  GDB does
     not fetch values until necessary, for efficiency.  For example:

          myval = gdb.parse_and_eval ('somevar')

     The value of 'somevar' is not fetched at this time.  It will be
     fetched when the value is needed, or when the 'fetch_lazy' method
     is invoked.

   The following methods are provided:

 -- Function: Value.__init__ (VAL)
     Many Python values can be converted directly to a 'gdb.Value' via
     this object initializer.  Specifically:

     Python boolean
          A Python boolean is converted to the boolean type from the
          current language.

     Python integer
          A Python integer is converted to the C 'long' type for the
          current architecture.

     Python long
          A Python long is converted to the C 'long long' type for the
          current architecture.

     Python float
          A Python float is converted to the C 'double' type for the
          current architecture.

     Python string
          A Python string is converted to a target string in the current
          target language using the current target encoding.  If a
          character cannot be represented in the current target
          encoding, then an exception is thrown.

     'gdb.Value'
          If 'val' is a 'gdb.Value', then a copy of the value is made.

     'gdb.LazyString'
          If 'val' is a 'gdb.LazyString' (*note Lazy Strings In
          Python::), then the lazy string's 'value' method is called,
          and its result is used.

 -- Function: Value.cast (type)
     Return a new instance of 'gdb.Value' that is the result of casting
     this instance to the type described by TYPE, which must be a
     'gdb.Type' object.  If the cast cannot be performed for some
     reason, this method throws an exception.

 -- Function: Value.dereference ()
     For pointer data types, this method returns a new 'gdb.Value'
     object whose contents is the object pointed to by the pointer.  For
     example, if 'foo' is a C pointer to an 'int', declared in your C
     program as

          int *foo;

     then you can use the corresponding 'gdb.Value' to access what 'foo'
     points to like this:

          bar = foo.dereference ()

     The result 'bar' will be a 'gdb.Value' object holding the value
     pointed to by 'foo'.

     A similar function 'Value.referenced_value' exists which also
     returns 'gdb.Value' objects corresonding to the values pointed to
     by pointer values (and additionally, values referenced by reference
     values).  However, the behavior of 'Value.dereference' differs from
     'Value.referenced_value' by the fact that the behavior of
     'Value.dereference' is identical to applying the C unary operator
     '*' on a given value.  For example, consider a reference to a
     pointer 'ptrref', declared in your C++ program as

          typedef int *intptr;
          ...
          int val = 10;
          intptr ptr = &val;
          intptr &ptrref = ptr;

     Though 'ptrref' is a reference value, one can apply the method
     'Value.dereference' to the 'gdb.Value' object corresponding to it
     and obtain a 'gdb.Value' which is identical to that corresponding
     to 'val'.  However, if you apply the method
     'Value.referenced_value', the result would be a 'gdb.Value' object
     identical to that corresponding to 'ptr'.

          py_ptrref = gdb.parse_and_eval ("ptrref")
          py_val = py_ptrref.dereference ()
          py_ptr = py_ptrref.referenced_value ()

     The 'gdb.Value' object 'py_val' is identical to that corresponding
     to 'val', and 'py_ptr' is identical to that corresponding to 'ptr'.
     In general, 'Value.dereference' can be applied whenever the C unary
     operator '*' can be applied to the corresponding C value.  For
     those cases where applying both 'Value.dereference' and
     'Value.referenced_value' is allowed, the results obtained need not
     be identical (as we have seen in the above example).  The results
     are however identical when applied on 'gdb.Value' objects
     corresponding to pointers ('gdb.Value' objects with type code
     'TYPE_CODE_PTR') in a C/C++ program.

 -- Function: Value.referenced_value ()
     For pointer or reference data types, this method returns a new
     'gdb.Value' object corresponding to the value referenced by the
     pointer/reference value.  For pointer data types,
     'Value.dereference' and 'Value.referenced_value' produce identical
     results.  The difference between these methods is that
     'Value.dereference' cannot get the values referenced by reference
     values.  For example, consider a reference to an 'int', declared in
     your C++ program as

          int val = 10;
          int &ref = val;

     then applying 'Value.dereference' to the 'gdb.Value' object
     corresponding to 'ref' will result in an error, while applying
     'Value.referenced_value' will result in a 'gdb.Value' object
     identical to that corresponding to 'val'.

          py_ref = gdb.parse_and_eval ("ref")
          er_ref = py_ref.dereference ()       # Results in error
          py_val = py_ref.referenced_value ()  # Returns the referenced value

     The 'gdb.Value' object 'py_val' is identical to that corresponding
     to 'val'.

 -- Function: Value.dynamic_cast (type)
     Like 'Value.cast', but works as if the C++ 'dynamic_cast' operator
     were used.  Consult a C++ reference for details.

 -- Function: Value.reinterpret_cast (type)
     Like 'Value.cast', but works as if the C++ 'reinterpret_cast'
     operator were used.  Consult a C++ reference for details.

 -- Function: Value.string ([encoding[, errors[, length]]])
     If this 'gdb.Value' represents a string, then this method converts
     the contents to a Python string.  Otherwise, this method will throw
     an exception.

     Values are interpreted as strings according to the rules of the
     current language.  If the optional length argument is given, the
     string will be converted to that length, and will include any
     embedded zeroes that the string may contain.  Otherwise, for
     languages where the string is zero-terminated, the entire string
     will be converted.

     For example, in C-like languages, a value is a string if it is a
     pointer to or an array of characters or ints of type 'wchar_t',
     'char16_t', or 'char32_t'.

     If the optional ENCODING argument is given, it must be a string
     naming the encoding of the string in the 'gdb.Value', such as
     '"ascii"', '"iso-8859-6"' or '"utf-8"'.  It accepts the same
     encodings as the corresponding argument to Python's 'string.decode'
     method, and the Python codec machinery will be used to convert the
     string.  If ENCODING is not given, or if ENCODING is the empty
     string, then either the 'target-charset' (*note Character Sets::)
     will be used, or a language-specific encoding will be used, if the
     current language is able to supply one.

     The optional ERRORS argument is the same as the corresponding
     argument to Python's 'string.decode' method.

     If the optional LENGTH argument is given, the string will be
     fetched and converted to the given length.

 -- Function: Value.lazy_string ([encoding [, length]])
     If this 'gdb.Value' represents a string, then this method converts
     the contents to a 'gdb.LazyString' (*note Lazy Strings In
     Python::).  Otherwise, this method will throw an exception.

     If the optional ENCODING argument is given, it must be a string
     naming the encoding of the 'gdb.LazyString'.  Some examples are:
     'ascii', 'iso-8859-6' or 'utf-8'.  If the ENCODING argument is an
     encoding that GDB does recognize, GDB will raise an error.

     When a lazy string is printed, the GDB encoding machinery is used
     to convert the string during printing.  If the optional ENCODING
     argument is not provided, or is an empty string, GDB will
     automatically select the encoding most suitable for the string
     type.  For further information on encoding in GDB please see *note
     Character Sets::.

     If the optional LENGTH argument is given, the string will be
     fetched and encoded to the length of characters specified.  If the
     LENGTH argument is not provided, the string will be fetched and
     encoded until a null of appropriate width is found.

 -- Function: Value.fetch_lazy ()
     If the 'gdb.Value' object is currently a lazy value
     ('gdb.Value.is_lazy' is 'True'), then the value is fetched from the
     inferior.  Any errors that occur in the process will produce a
     Python exception.

     If the 'gdb.Value' object is not a lazy value, this method has no
     effect.

     This method does not return a value.

23.2.2.4 Types In Python
........................

GDB represents types from the inferior using the class 'gdb.Type'.

   The following type-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.lookup_type (name [, block])
     This function looks up a type by its NAME, which must be a string.

     If BLOCK is given, then NAME is looked up in that scope.
     Otherwise, it is searched for globally.

     Ordinarily, this function will return an instance of 'gdb.Type'.
     If the named type cannot be found, it will throw an exception.

   If the type is a structure or class type, or an enum type, the fields
of that type can be accessed using the Python "dictionary syntax".  For
example, if 'some_type' is a 'gdb.Type' instance holding a structure
type, you can access its 'foo' field with:

     bar = some_type['foo']

   'bar' will be a 'gdb.Field' object; see below under the description
of the 'Type.fields' method for a description of the 'gdb.Field' class.

   An instance of 'Type' has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Type.code
     The type code for this type.  The type code will be one of the
     'TYPE_CODE_' constants defined below.

 -- Variable: Type.name
     The name of this type.  If this type has no name, then 'None' is
     returned.

 -- Variable: Type.sizeof
     The size of this type, in target 'char' units.  Usually, a target's
     'char' type will be an 8-bit byte.  However, on some unusual
     platforms, this type may have a different size.

 -- Variable: Type.tag
     The tag name for this type.  The tag name is the name after
     'struct', 'union', or 'enum' in C and C++; not all languages have
     this concept.  If this type has no tag name, then 'None' is
     returned.

   The following methods are provided:

 -- Function: Type.fields ()
     For structure and union types, this method returns the fields.
     Range types have two fields, the minimum and maximum values.  Enum
     types have one field per enum constant.  Function and method types
     have one field per parameter.  The base types of C++ classes are
     also represented as fields.  If the type has no fields, or does not
     fit into one of these categories, an empty sequence will be
     returned.

     Each field is a 'gdb.Field' object, with some pre-defined
     attributes:
     'bitpos'
          This attribute is not available for 'enum' or 'static' (as in
          C++ or Java) fields.  The value is the position, counting in
          bits, from the start of the containing type.

     'enumval'
          This attribute is only available for 'enum' fields, and its
          value is the enumeration member's integer representation.

     'name'
          The name of the field, or 'None' for anonymous fields.

     'artificial'
          This is 'True' if the field is artificial, usually meaning
          that it was provided by the compiler and not the user.  This
          attribute is always provided, and is 'False' if the field is
          not artificial.

     'is_base_class'
          This is 'True' if the field represents a base class of a C++
          structure.  This attribute is always provided, and is 'False'
          if the field is not a base class of the type that is the
          argument of 'fields', or if that type was not a C++ class.

     'bitsize'
          If the field is packed, or is a bitfield, then this will have
          a non-zero value, which is the size of the field in bits.
          Otherwise, this will be zero; in this case the field's size is
          given by its type.

     'type'
          The type of the field.  This is usually an instance of 'Type',
          but it can be 'None' in some situations.

     'parent_type'
          The type which contains this field.  This is an instance of
          'gdb.Type'.

 -- Function: Type.array (N1 [, N2])
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents an array of this
     type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
     the array; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments
     are given, the first argument is the lower bound of the array, and
     the second argument is the upper bound of the array.  An array's
     length must not be negative, but the bounds can be.

 -- Function: Type.vector (N1 [, N2])
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents a vector of this
     type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
     the vector; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments
     are given, the first argument is the lower bound of the vector, and
     the second argument is the upper bound of the vector.  A vector's
     length must not be negative, but the bounds can be.

     The difference between an 'array' and a 'vector' is that arrays
     behave like in C: when used in expressions they decay to a pointer
     to the first element whereas vectors are treated as first class
     values.

 -- Function: Type.const ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents a 'const'-qualified
     variant of this type.

 -- Function: Type.volatile ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents a
     'volatile'-qualified variant of this type.

 -- Function: Type.unqualified ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents an unqualified
     variant of this type.  That is, the result is neither 'const' nor
     'volatile'.

 -- Function: Type.range ()
     Return a Python 'Tuple' object that contains two elements: the low
     bound of the argument type and the high bound of that type.  If the
     type does not have a range, GDB will raise a 'gdb.error' exception
     (*note Exception Handling::).

 -- Function: Type.reference ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents a reference to this
     type.

 -- Function: Type.pointer ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents a pointer to this
     type.

 -- Function: Type.strip_typedefs ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' that represents the real type, after
     removing all layers of typedefs.

 -- Function: Type.target ()
     Return a new 'gdb.Type' object which represents the target type of
     this type.

     For a pointer type, the target type is the type of the pointed-to
     object.  For an array type (meaning C-like arrays), the target type
     is the type of the elements of the array.  For a function or method
     type, the target type is the type of the return value.  For a
     complex type, the target type is the type of the elements.  For a
     typedef, the target type is the aliased type.

     If the type does not have a target, this method will throw an
     exception.

 -- Function: Type.template_argument (n [, block])
     If this 'gdb.Type' is an instantiation of a template, this will
     return a new 'gdb.Type' which represents the type of the Nth
     template argument.

     If this 'gdb.Type' is not a template type, this will throw an
     exception.  Ordinarily, only C++ code will have template types.

     If BLOCK is given, then NAME is looked up in that scope.
     Otherwise, it is searched for globally.

   Each type has a code, which indicates what category this type falls
into.  The available type categories are represented by constants
defined in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_PTR'
     The type is a pointer.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_ARRAY'
     The type is an array.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_STRUCT'
     The type is a structure.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_UNION'
     The type is a union.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_ENUM'
     The type is an enum.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_FLAGS'
     A bit flags type, used for things such as status registers.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_FUNC'
     The type is a function.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_INT'
     The type is an integer type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_FLT'
     A floating point type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_VOID'
     The special type 'void'.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_SET'
     A Pascal set type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_RANGE'
     A range type, that is, an integer type with bounds.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_STRING'
     A string type.  Note that this is only used for certain languages
     with language-defined string types; C strings are not represented
     this way.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_BITSTRING'
     A string of bits.  It is deprecated.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_ERROR'
     An unknown or erroneous type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_METHOD'
     A method type, as found in C++ or Java.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_METHODPTR'
     A pointer-to-member-function.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_MEMBERPTR'
     A pointer-to-member.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_REF'
     A reference type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_CHAR'
     A character type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_BOOL'
     A boolean type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_COMPLEX'
     A complex float type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_TYPEDEF'
     A typedef to some other type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_NAMESPACE'
     A C++ namespace.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_DECFLOAT'
     A decimal floating point type.

'gdb.TYPE_CODE_INTERNAL_FUNCTION'
     A function internal to GDB.  This is the type used to represent
     convenience functions.

   Further support for types is provided in the 'gdb.types' Python
module (*note gdb.types::).

23.2.2.5 Pretty Printing API
............................

An example output is provided (*note Pretty Printing::).

   A pretty-printer is just an object that holds a value and implements
a specific interface, defined here.

 -- Function: pretty_printer.children (self)
     GDB will call this method on a pretty-printer to compute the
     children of the pretty-printer's value.

     This method must return an object conforming to the Python iterator
     protocol.  Each item returned by the iterator must be a tuple
     holding two elements.  The first element is the "name" of the
     child; the second element is the child's value.  The value can be
     any Python object which is convertible to a GDB value.

     This method is optional.  If it does not exist, GDB will act as
     though the value has no children.

 -- Function: pretty_printer.display_hint (self)
     The CLI may call this method and use its result to change the
     formatting of a value.  The result will also be supplied to an MI
     consumer as a 'displayhint' attribute of the variable being
     printed.

     This method is optional.  If it does exist, this method must return
     a string.

     Some display hints are predefined by GDB:

     'array'
          Indicate that the object being printed is "array-like".  The
          CLI uses this to respect parameters such as 'set print
          elements' and 'set print array'.

     'map'
          Indicate that the object being printed is "map-like", and that
          the children of this value can be assumed to alternate between
          keys and values.

     'string'
          Indicate that the object being printed is "string-like".  If
          the printer's 'to_string' method returns a Python string of
          some kind, then GDB will call its internal language-specific
          string-printing function to format the string.  For the CLI
          this means adding quotation marks, possibly escaping some
          characters, respecting 'set print elements', and the like.

 -- Function: pretty_printer.to_string (self)
     GDB will call this method to display the string representation of
     the value passed to the object's constructor.

     When printing from the CLI, if the 'to_string' method exists, then
     GDB will prepend its result to the values returned by 'children'.
     Exactly how this formatting is done is dependent on the display
     hint, and may change as more hints are added.  Also, depending on
     the print settings (*note Print Settings::), the CLI may print just
     the result of 'to_string' in a stack trace, omitting the result of
     'children'.

     If this method returns a string, it is printed verbatim.

     Otherwise, if this method returns an instance of 'gdb.Value', then
     GDB prints this value.  This may result in a call to another
     pretty-printer.

     If instead the method returns a Python value which is convertible
     to a 'gdb.Value', then GDB performs the conversion and prints the
     resulting value.  Again, this may result in a call to another
     pretty-printer.  Python scalars (integers, floats, and booleans)
     and strings are convertible to 'gdb.Value'; other types are not.

     Finally, if this method returns 'None' then no further operations
     are peformed in this method and nothing is printed.

     If the result is not one of these types, an exception is raised.

   GDB provides a function which can be used to look up the default
pretty-printer for a 'gdb.Value':

 -- Function: gdb.default_visualizer (value)
     This function takes a 'gdb.Value' object as an argument.  If a
     pretty-printer for this value exists, then it is returned.  If no
     such printer exists, then this returns 'None'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Selecting Pretty-Printers,  Next: Writing a Pretty-Printer,  Prev: Pretty Printing API,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.6 Selecting Pretty-Printers
..................................

The Python list 'gdb.pretty_printers' contains an array of functions or
callable objects that have been registered via addition as a
pretty-printer.  Printers in this list are called 'global' printers,
they're available when debugging all inferiors.  Each 'gdb.Progspace'
contains a 'pretty_printers' attribute.  Each 'gdb.Objfile' also
contains a 'pretty_printers' attribute.

   Each function on these lists is passed a single 'gdb.Value' argument
and should return a pretty-printer object conforming to the interface
definition above (*note Pretty Printing API::).  If a function cannot
create a pretty-printer for the value, it should return 'None'.

   GDB first checks the 'pretty_printers' attribute of each
'gdb.Objfile' in the current program space and iteratively calls each
enabled lookup routine in the list for that 'gdb.Objfile' until it
receives a pretty-printer object.  If no pretty-printer is found in the
objfile lists, GDB then searches the pretty-printer list of the current
program space, calling each enabled function until an object is
returned.  After these lists have been exhausted, it tries the global
'gdb.pretty_printers' list, again calling each enabled function until an
object is returned.

   The order in which the objfiles are searched is not specified.  For a
given list, functions are always invoked from the head of the list, and
iterated over sequentially until the end of the list, or a printer
object is returned.

   For various reasons a pretty-printer may not work.  For example, the
underlying data structure may have changed and the pretty-printer is out
of date.

   The consequences of a broken pretty-printer are severe enough that
GDB provides support for enabling and disabling individual printers.
For example, if 'print frame-arguments' is on, a backtrace can become
highly illegible if any argument is printed with a broken printer.

   Pretty-printers are enabled and disabled by attaching an 'enabled'
attribute to the registered function or callable object.  If this
attribute is present and its value is 'False', the printer is disabled,
otherwise the printer is enabled.

23.2.2.7 Writing a Pretty-Printer
.................................

A pretty-printer consists of two parts: a lookup function to detect if
the type is supported, and the printer itself.

   Here is an example showing how a 'std::string' printer might be
written.  *Note Pretty Printing API::, for details on the API this class
must provide.

     class StdStringPrinter(object):
         "Print a std::string"

         def __init__(self, val):
             self.val = val

         def to_string(self):
             return self.val['_M_dataplus']['_M_p']

         def display_hint(self):
             return 'string'

   And here is an example showing how a lookup function for the printer
example above might be written.

     def str_lookup_function(val):
         lookup_tag = val.type.tag
         if lookup_tag == None:
             return None
         regex = re.compile("^std::basic_string<char,.*>$")
         if regex.match(lookup_tag):
             return StdStringPrinter(val)
         return None

   The example lookup function extracts the value's type, and attempts
to match it to a type that it can pretty-print.  If it is a type the
printer can pretty-print, it will return a printer object.  If not, it
returns 'None'.

   We recommend that you put your core pretty-printers into a Python
package.  If your pretty-printers are for use with a library, we further
recommend embedding a version number into the package name.  This
practice will enable GDB to load multiple versions of your
pretty-printers at the same time, because they will have different
names.

   You should write auto-loaded code (*note Python Auto-loading::) such
that it can be evaluated multiple times without changing its meaning.
An ideal auto-load file will consist solely of 'import's of your printer
modules, followed by a call to a register pretty-printers with the
current objfile.

   Taken as a whole, this approach will scale nicely to multiple
inferiors, each potentially using a different library version.
Embedding a version number in the Python package name will ensure that
GDB is able to load both sets of printers simultaneously.  Then, because
the search for pretty-printers is done by objfile, and because your
auto-loaded code took care to register your library's printers with a
specific objfile, GDB will find the correct printers for the specific
version of the library used by each inferior.

   To continue the 'std::string' example (*note Pretty Printing API::),
this code might appear in 'gdb.libstdcxx.v6':

     def register_printers(objfile):
         objfile.pretty_printers.append(str_lookup_function)

And then the corresponding contents of the auto-load file would be:

     import gdb.libstdcxx.v6
     gdb.libstdcxx.v6.register_printers(gdb.current_objfile())

   The previous example illustrates a basic pretty-printer.  There are a
few things that can be improved on.  The printer doesn't have a name,
making it hard to identify in a list of installed printers.  The lookup
function has a name, but lookup functions can have arbitrary, even
identical, names.

   Second, the printer only handles one type, whereas a library
typically has several types.  One could install a lookup function for
each desired type in the library, but one could also have a single
lookup function recognize several types.  The latter is the conventional
way this is handled.  If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data
types, then its "subprinters" are the printers for the individual data
types.

   The 'gdb.printing' module provides a formal way of solving these
problems (*note gdb.printing::).  Here is another example that handles
multiple types.

   These are the types we are going to pretty-print:

     struct foo { int a, b; };
     struct bar { struct foo x, y; };

   Here are the printers:

     class fooPrinter:
         """Print a foo object."""

         def __init__(self, val):
             self.val = val

         def to_string(self):
             return ("a=<" + str(self.val["a"]) +
                     "> b=<" + str(self.val["b"]) + ">")

     class barPrinter:
         """Print a bar object."""

         def __init__(self, val):
             self.val = val

         def to_string(self):
             return ("x=<" + str(self.val["x"]) +
                     "> y=<" + str(self.val["y"]) + ">")

   This example doesn't need a lookup function, that is handled by the
'gdb.printing' module.  Instead a function is provided to build up the
object that handles the lookup.

     import gdb.printing

     def build_pretty_printer():
         pp = gdb.printing.RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter(
             "my_library")
         pp.add_printer('foo', '^foo$', fooPrinter)
         pp.add_printer('bar', '^bar$', barPrinter)
         return pp

   And here is the autoload support:

     import gdb.printing
     import my_library
     gdb.printing.register_pretty_printer(
         gdb.current_objfile(),
         my_library.build_pretty_printer())

   Finally, when this printer is loaded into GDB, here is the
corresponding output of 'info pretty-printer':

     (gdb) info pretty-printer
     my_library.so:
       my_library
         foo
         bar

23.2.2.8 Type Printing API
..........................

GDB provides a way for Python code to customize type display.  This is
mainly useful for substituting canonical typedef names for types.

   A "type printer" is just a Python object conforming to a certain
protocol.  A simple base class implementing the protocol is provided;
see *note gdb.types::.  A type printer must supply at least:

 -- Instance Variable of type_printer: enabled
     A boolean which is True if the printer is enabled, and False
     otherwise.  This is manipulated by the 'enable type-printer' and
     'disable type-printer' commands.

 -- Instance Variable of type_printer: name
     The name of the type printer.  This must be a string.  This is used
     by the 'enable type-printer' and 'disable type-printer' commands.

 -- Method on type_printer: instantiate (self)
     This is called by GDB at the start of type-printing.  It is only
     called if the type printer is enabled.  This method must return a
     new object that supplies a 'recognize' method, as described below.

   When displaying a type, say via the 'ptype' command, GDB will compute
a list of type recognizers.  This is done by iterating first over the
per-objfile type printers (*note Objfiles In Python::), followed by the
per-progspace type printers (*note Progspaces In Python::), and finally
the global type printers.

   GDB will call the 'instantiate' method of each enabled type printer.
If this method returns 'None', then the result is ignored; otherwise, it
is appended to the list of recognizers.

   Then, when GDB is going to display a type name, it iterates over the
list of recognizers.  For each one, it calls the recognition function,
stopping if the function returns a non-'None' value.  The recognition
function is defined as:

 -- Method on type_recognizer: recognize (self, type)
     If TYPE is not recognized, return 'None'.  Otherwise, return a
     string which is to be printed as the name of TYPE.  The TYPE
     argument will be an instance of 'gdb.Type' (*note Types In
     Python::).

   GDB uses this two-pass approach so that type printers can efficiently
cache information without holding on to it too long.  For example, it
can be convenient to look up type information in a type printer and hold
it for a recognizer's lifetime; if a single pass were done then type
printers would have to make use of the event system in order to avoid
holding information that could become stale as the inferior changed.

23.2.2.9 Filtering Frames.
..........................

Frame filters are Python objects that manipulate the visibility of a
frame or frames when a backtrace (*note Backtrace::) is printed by GDB.

   Only commands that print a backtrace, or, in the case of GDB/MI
commands (*note GDB/MI::), those that return a collection of frames are
affected.  The commands that work with frame filters are:

   'backtrace' (*note The backtrace command: backtrace-command.),
'-stack-list-frames' (*note The -stack-list-frames command:
-stack-list-frames.), '-stack-list-variables' (*note The
-stack-list-variables command: -stack-list-variables.),
'-stack-list-arguments' *note The -stack-list-arguments command:
-stack-list-arguments.) and '-stack-list-locals' (*note The
-stack-list-locals command: -stack-list-locals.).

   A frame filter works by taking an iterator as an argument, applying
actions to the contents of that iterator, and returning another iterator
(or, possibly, the same iterator it was provided in the case where the
filter does not perform any operations).  Typically, frame filters
utilize tools such as the Python's 'itertools' module to work with and
create new iterators from the source iterator.  Regardless of how a
filter chooses to apply actions, it must not alter the underlying GDB
frame or frames, or attempt to alter the call-stack within GDB.  This
preserves data integrity within GDB.  Frame filters are executed on a
priority basis and care should be taken that some frame filters may have
been executed before, and that some frame filters will be executed
after.

   An important consideration when designing frame filters, and well
worth reflecting upon, is that frame filters should avoid unwinding the
call stack if possible.  Some stacks can run very deep, into the tens of
thousands in some cases.  To search every frame when a frame filter
executes may be too expensive at that step.  The frame filter cannot
know how many frames it has to iterate over, and it may have to iterate
through them all.  This ends up duplicating effort as GDB performs this
iteration when it prints the frames.  If the filter can defer unwinding
frames until frame decorators are executed, after the last filter has
executed, it should.  *Note Frame Decorator API::, for more information
on decorators.  Also, there are examples for both frame decorators and
filters in later chapters.  *Note Writing a Frame Filter::, for more
information.

   The Python dictionary 'gdb.frame_filters' contains key/object
pairings that comprise a frame filter.  Frame filters in this dictionary
are called 'global' frame filters, and they are available when debugging
all inferiors.  These frame filters must register with the dictionary
directly.  In addition to the 'global' dictionary, there are other
dictionaries that are loaded with different inferiors via auto-loading
(*note Python Auto-loading::).  The two other areas where frame filter
dictionaries can be found are: 'gdb.Progspace' which contains a
'frame_filters' dictionary attribute, and each 'gdb.Objfile' object
which also contains a 'frame_filters' dictionary attribute.

   When a command is executed from GDB that is compatible with frame
filters, GDB combines the 'global', 'gdb.Progspace' and all
'gdb.Objfile' dictionaries currently loaded.  All of the 'gdb.Objfile'
dictionaries are combined, as several frames, and thus several object
files, might be in use.  GDB then prunes any frame filter whose
'enabled' attribute is 'False'.  This pruned list is then sorted
according to the 'priority' attribute in each filter.

   Once the dictionaries are combined, pruned and sorted, GDB creates an
iterator which wraps each frame in the call stack in a 'FrameDecorator'
object, and calls each filter in order.  The output from the previous
filter will always be the input to the next filter, and so on.

   Frame filters have a mandatory interface which each frame filter must
implement, defined here:

 -- Function: FrameFilter.filter (iterator)
     GDB will call this method on a frame filter when it has reached the
     order in the priority list for that filter.

     For example, if there are four frame filters:

          Name         Priority

          Filter1      5
          Filter2      10
          Filter3      100
          Filter4      1

     The order that the frame filters will be called is:

          Filter3 -> Filter2 -> Filter1 -> Filter4

     Note that the output from 'Filter3' is passed to the input of
     'Filter2', and so on.

     This 'filter' method is passed a Python iterator.  This iterator
     contains a sequence of frame decorators that wrap each 'gdb.Frame',
     or a frame decorator that wraps another frame decorator.  The first
     filter that is executed in the sequence of frame filters will
     receive an iterator entirely comprised of default 'FrameDecorator'
     objects.  However, after each frame filter is executed, the
     previous frame filter may have wrapped some or all of the frame
     decorators with their own frame decorator.  As frame decorators
     must also conform to a mandatory interface, these decorators can be
     assumed to act in a uniform manner (*note Frame Decorator API::).

     This method must return an object conforming to the Python iterator
     protocol.  Each item in the iterator must be an object conforming
     to the frame decorator interface.  If a frame filter does not wish
     to perform any operations on this iterator, it should return that
     iterator untouched.

     This method is not optional.  If it does not exist, GDB will raise
     and print an error.

 -- Variable: FrameFilter.name
     The 'name' attribute must be Python string which contains the name
     of the filter displayed by GDB (*note Frame Filter Management::).
     This attribute may contain any combination of letters or numbers.
     Care should be taken to ensure that it is unique.  This attribute
     is mandatory.

 -- Variable: FrameFilter.enabled
     The 'enabled' attribute must be Python boolean.  This attribute
     indicates to GDB whether the frame filter is enabled, and should be
     considered when frame filters are executed.  If 'enabled' is
     'True', then the frame filter will be executed when any of the
     backtrace commands detailed earlier in this chapter are executed.
     If 'enabled' is 'False', then the frame filter will not be
     executed.  This attribute is mandatory.

 -- Variable: FrameFilter.priority
     The 'priority' attribute must be Python integer.  This attribute
     controls the order of execution in relation to other frame filters.
     There are no imposed limits on the range of 'priority' other than
     it must be a valid integer.  The higher the 'priority' attribute,
     the sooner the frame filter will be executed in relation to other
     frame filters.  Although 'priority' can be negative, it is
     recommended practice to assume zero is the lowest priority that a
     frame filter can be assigned.  Frame filters that have the same
     priority are executed in unsorted order in that priority slot.
     This attribute is mandatory.

23.2.2.10 Decorating Frames.
............................

Frame decorators are sister objects to frame filters (*note Frame Filter
API::).  Frame decorators are applied by a frame filter and can only be
used in conjunction with frame filters.

   The purpose of a frame decorator is to customize the printed content
of each 'gdb.Frame' in commands where frame filters are executed.  This
concept is called decorating a frame.  Frame decorators decorate a
'gdb.Frame' with Python code contained within each API call.  This
separates the actual data contained in a 'gdb.Frame' from the decorated
data produced by a frame decorator.  This abstraction is necessary to
maintain integrity of the data contained in each 'gdb.Frame'.

   Frame decorators have a mandatory interface, defined below.

   GDB already contains a frame decorator called 'FrameDecorator'.  This
contains substantial amounts of boilerplate code to decorate the content
of a 'gdb.Frame'.  It is recommended that other frame decorators inherit
and extend this object, and only to override the methods needed.

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.elided (self)

     The 'elided' method groups frames together in a hierarchical
     system.  An example would be an interpreter, where multiple
     low-level frames make up a single call in the interpreted language.
     In this example, the frame filter would elide the low-level frames
     and present a single high-level frame, representing the call in the
     interpreted language, to the user.

     The 'elided' function must return an iterable and this iterable
     must contain the frames that are being elided wrapped in a suitable
     frame decorator.  If no frames are being elided this function may
     return an empty iterable, or 'None'.  Elided frames are indented
     from normal frames in a 'CLI' backtrace, or in the case of
     'GDB/MI', are placed in the 'children' field of the eliding frame.

     It is the frame filter's task to also filter out the elided frames
     from the source iterator.  This will avoid printing the frame
     twice.

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.function (self)

     This method returns the name of the function in the frame that is
     to be printed.

     This method must return a Python string describing the function, or
     'None'.

     If this function returns 'None', GDB will not print any data for
     this field.

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.address (self)

     This method returns the address of the frame that is to be printed.

     This method must return a Python numeric integer type of sufficient
     size to describe the address of the frame, or 'None'.

     If this function returns a 'None', GDB will not print any data for
     this field.

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.filename (self)

     This method returns the filename and path associated with this
     frame.

     This method must return a Python string containing the filename and
     the path to the object file backing the frame, or 'None'.

     If this function returns a 'None', GDB will not print any data for
     this field.

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.line (self):

     This method returns the line number associated with the current
     position within the function addressed by this frame.

     This method must return a Python integer type, or 'None'.

     If this function returns a 'None', GDB will not print any data for
     this field.

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.frame_args (self)

     This method must return an iterable, or 'None'.  Returning an empty
     iterable, or 'None' means frame arguments will not be printed for
     this frame.  This iterable must contain objects that implement two
     methods, described here.

     This object must implement a 'argument' method which takes a single
     'self' parameter and must return a 'gdb.Symbol' (*note Symbols In
     Python::), or a Python string.  The object must also implement a
     'value' method which takes a single 'self' parameter and must
     return a 'gdb.Value' (*note Values From Inferior::), a Python
     value, or 'None'.  If the 'value' method returns 'None', and the
     'argument' method returns a 'gdb.Symbol', GDB will look-up and
     print the value of the 'gdb.Symbol' automatically.

     A brief example:

          class SymValueWrapper():

              def __init__(self, symbol, value):
                  self.sym = symbol
                  self.val = value

              def value(self):
                  return self.val

              def symbol(self):
                  return self.sym

          class SomeFrameDecorator()
          ...
          ...
              def frame_args(self):
                  args = []
                  try:
                      block = self.inferior_frame.block()
                  except:
                      return None

                  # Iterate over all symbols in a block.  Only add
                  # symbols that are arguments.
                  for sym in block:
                      if not sym.is_argument:
                          continue
                      args.append(SymValueWrapper(sym,None))

                  # Add example synthetic argument.
                  args.append(SymValueWrapper(``foo'', 42))

                  return args

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.frame_locals (self)

     This method must return an iterable or 'None'.  Returning an empty
     iterable, or 'None' means frame local arguments will not be printed
     for this frame.

     The object interface, the description of the various strategies for
     reading frame locals, and the example are largely similar to those
     described in the 'frame_args' function, (*note The frame filter
     frame_args function: frame_args.).  Below is a modified example:

          class SomeFrameDecorator()
          ...
          ...
              def frame_locals(self):
                  vars = []
                  try:
                      block = self.inferior_frame.block()
                  except:
                      return None

                  # Iterate over all symbols in a block.  Add all
                  # symbols, except arguments.
                  for sym in block:
                      if sym.is_argument:
                          continue
                      vars.append(SymValueWrapper(sym,None))

                  # Add an example of a synthetic local variable.
                  vars.append(SymValueWrapper(``bar'', 99))

                  return vars

 -- Function: FrameDecorator.inferior_frame (self):

     This method must return the underlying 'gdb.Frame' that this frame
     decorator is decorating.  GDB requires the underlying frame for
     internal frame information to determine how to print certain values
     when printing a frame.

23.2.2.11 Writing a Frame Filter
................................

There are three basic elements that a frame filter must implement: it
must correctly implement the documented interface (*note Frame Filter
API::), it must register itself with GDB, and finally, it must decide if
it is to work on the data provided by GDB.  In all cases, whether it
works on the iterator or not, each frame filter must return an iterator.
A bare-bones frame filter follows the pattern in the following example.

     import gdb

     class FrameFilter():

         def __init__(self):
             # Frame filter attribute creation.
             #
             # 'name' is the name of the filter that GDB will display.
             #
             # 'priority' is the priority of the filter relative to other
             # filters.
             #
             # 'enabled' is a boolean that indicates whether this filter is
             # enabled and should be executed.

             self.name = "Foo"
             self.priority = 100
             self.enabled = True

             # Register this frame filter with the global frame_filters
             # dictionary.
             gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

         def filter(self, frame_iter):
             # Just return the iterator.
             return frame_iter

   The frame filter in the example above implements the three
requirements for all frame filters.  It implements the API, self
registers, and makes a decision on the iterator (in this case, it just
returns the iterator untouched).

   The first step is attribute creation and assignment, and as shown in
the comments the filter assigns the following attributes: 'name',
'priority' and whether the filter should be enabled with the 'enabled'
attribute.

   The second step is registering the frame filter with the dictionary
or dictionaries that the frame filter has interest in.  As shown in the
comments, this filter just registers itself with the global dictionary
'gdb.frame_filters'.  As noted earlier, 'gdb.frame_filters' is a
dictionary that is initialized in the 'gdb' module when GDB starts.
What dictionary a filter registers with is an important consideration.
Generally, if a filter is specific to a set of code, it should be
registered either in the 'objfile' or 'progspace' dictionaries as they
are specific to the program currently loaded in GDB.  The global
dictionary is always present in GDB and is never unloaded.  Any filters
registered with the global dictionary will exist until GDB exits.  To
avoid filters that may conflict, it is generally better to register
frame filters against the dictionaries that more closely align with the
usage of the filter currently in question.  *Note Python Auto-loading::,
for further information on auto-loading Python scripts.

   GDB takes a hands-off approach to frame filter registration,
therefore it is the frame filter's responsibility to ensure registration
has occurred, and that any exceptions are handled appropriately.  In
particular, you may wish to handle exceptions relating to Python
dictionary key uniqueness.  It is mandatory that the dictionary key is
the same as frame filter's 'name' attribute.  When a user manages frame
filters (*note Frame Filter Management::), the names GDB will display
are those contained in the 'name' attribute.

   The final step of this example is the implementation of the 'filter'
method.  As shown in the example comments, we define the 'filter' method
and note that the method must take an iterator, and also must return an
iterator.  In this bare-bones example, the frame filter is not very
useful as it just returns the iterator untouched.  However this is a
valid operation for frame filters that have the 'enabled' attribute set,
but decide not to operate on any frames.

   In the next example, the frame filter operates on all frames and
utilizes a frame decorator to perform some work on the frames.  *Note
Frame Decorator API::, for further information on the frame decorator
interface.

   This example works on inlined frames.  It highlights frames which are
inlined by tagging them with an "[inlined]" tag.  By applying a frame
decorator to all frames with the Python 'itertools imap' method, the
example defers actions to the frame decorator.  Frame decorators are
only processed when GDB prints the backtrace.

   This introduces a new decision making topic: whether to perform
decision making operations at the filtering step, or at the printing
step.  In this example's approach, it does not perform any filtering
decisions at the filtering step beyond mapping a frame decorator to each
frame.  This allows the actual decision making to be performed when each
frame is printed.  This is an important consideration, and well worth
reflecting upon when designing a frame filter.  An issue that frame
filters should avoid is unwinding the stack if possible.  Some stacks
can run very deep, into the tens of thousands in some cases.  To search
every frame to determine if it is inlined ahead of time may be too
expensive at the filtering step.  The frame filter cannot know how many
frames it has to iterate over, and it would have to iterate through them
all.  This ends up duplicating effort as GDB performs this iteration
when it prints the frames.

   In this example decision making can be deferred to the printing step.
As each frame is printed, the frame decorator can examine each frame in
turn when GDB iterates.  From a performance viewpoint, this is the most
appropriate decision to make as it avoids duplicating the effort that
the printing step would undertake anyway.  Also, if there are many frame
filters unwinding the stack during filtering, it can substantially delay
the printing of the backtrace which will result in large memory usage,
and a poor user experience.

     class InlineFilter():

         def __init__(self):
             self.name = "InlinedFrameFilter"
             self.priority = 100
             self.enabled = True
             gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

         def filter(self, frame_iter):
             frame_iter = itertools.imap(InlinedFrameDecorator,
                                         frame_iter)
             return frame_iter

   This frame filter is somewhat similar to the earlier example, except
that the 'filter' method applies a frame decorator object called
'InlinedFrameDecorator' to each element in the iterator.  The 'imap'
Python method is light-weight.  It does not proactively iterate over the
iterator, but rather creates a new iterator which wraps the existing
one.

   Below is the frame decorator for this example.

     class InlinedFrameDecorator(FrameDecorator):

         def __init__(self, fobj):
             super(InlinedFrameDecorator, self).__init__(fobj)

         def function(self):
             frame = fobj.inferior_frame()
             name = str(frame.name())

             if frame.type() == gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
                 name = name + " [inlined]"

             return name

   This frame decorator only defines and overrides the 'function'
method.  It lets the supplied 'FrameDecorator', which is shipped with
GDB, perform the other work associated with printing this frame.

   The combination of these two objects create this output from a
backtrace:

     #0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
     #1  0x00400566 in max [inlined] (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:21
     #2  0x00400566 in main () at inline.c:31

   So in the case of this example, a frame decorator is applied to all
frames, regardless of whether they may be inlined or not.  As GDB
iterates over the iterator produced by the frame filters, GDB executes
each frame decorator which then makes a decision on what to print in the
'function' callback.  Using a strategy like this is a way to defer
decisions on the frame content to printing time.

Eliding Frames
--------------

It might be that the above example is not desirable for representing
inlined frames, and a hierarchical approach may be preferred.  If we
want to hierarchically represent frames, the 'elided' frame decorator
interface might be preferable.

   This example approaches the issue with the 'elided' method.  This
example is quite long, but very simplistic.  It is out-of-scope for this
section to write a complete example that comprehensively covers all
approaches of finding and printing inlined frames.  However, this
example illustrates the approach an author might use.

   This example comprises of three sections.

     class InlineFrameFilter():

         def __init__(self):
             self.name = "InlinedFrameFilter"
             self.priority = 100
             self.enabled = True
             gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

         def filter(self, frame_iter):
             return ElidingInlineIterator(frame_iter)

   This frame filter is very similar to the other examples.  The only
difference is this frame filter is wrapping the iterator provided to it
('frame_iter') with a custom iterator called 'ElidingInlineIterator'.
This again defers actions to when GDB prints the backtrace, as the
iterator is not traversed until printing.

   The iterator for this example is as follows.  It is in this section
of the example where decisions are made on the content of the backtrace.

     class ElidingInlineIterator:
         def __init__(self, ii):
             self.input_iterator = ii

         def __iter__(self):
             return self

         def next(self):
             frame = next(self.input_iterator)

             if frame.inferior_frame().type() != gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
                 return frame

             try:
                 eliding_frame = next(self.input_iterator)
             except StopIteration:
                 return frame
             return ElidingFrameDecorator(eliding_frame, [frame])

   This iterator implements the Python iterator protocol.  When the
'next' function is called (when GDB prints each frame), the iterator
checks if this frame decorator, 'frame', is wrapping an inlined frame.
If it is not, it returns the existing frame decorator untouched.  If it
is wrapping an inlined frame, it assumes that the inlined frame was
contained within the next oldest frame, 'eliding_frame', which it
fetches.  It then creates and returns a frame decorator,
'ElidingFrameDecorator', which contains both the elided frame, and the
eliding frame.

     class ElidingInlineDecorator(FrameDecorator):

         def __init__(self, frame, elided_frames):
             super(ElidingInlineDecorator, self).__init__(frame)
             self.frame = frame
             self.elided_frames = elided_frames

         def elided(self):
             return iter(self.elided_frames)

   This frame decorator overrides one function and returns the inlined
frame in the 'elided' method.  As before it lets 'FrameDecorator' do the
rest of the work involved in printing this frame.  This produces the
following output.

     #0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
     #2  0x00400529 in main () at inline.c:25
         #1  0x00400529 in max (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:15

   In that output, 'max' which has been inlined into 'main' is printed
hierarchically.  Another approach would be to combine the 'function'
method, and the 'elided' method to both print a marker in the inlined
frame, and also show the hierarchical relationship.

23.2.2.12 Xmethods In Python
............................

"Xmethods" are additional methods or replacements for existing methods
of a C++ class.  This feature is useful for those cases where a method
defined in C++ source code could be inlined or optimized out by the
compiler, making it unavailable to GDB.  For such cases, one can define
an xmethod to serve as a replacement for the method defined in the C++
source code.  GDB will then invoke the xmethod, instead of the C++
method, to evaluate expressions.  One can also use xmethods when
debugging with core files.  Moreover, when debugging live programs,
invoking an xmethod need not involve running the inferior (which can
potentially perturb its state).  Hence, even if the C++ method is
available, it is better to use its replacement xmethod if one is
defined.

   The xmethods feature in Python is available via the concepts of an
"xmethod matcher" and an "xmethod worker".  To implement an xmethod, one
has to implement a matcher and a corresponding worker for it (more than
one worker can be implemented, each catering to a different overloaded
instance of the method).  Internally, GDB invokes the 'match' method of
a matcher to match the class type and method name.  On a match, the
'match' method returns a list of matching _worker_ objects.  Each worker
object typically corresponds to an overloaded instance of the xmethod.
They implement a 'get_arg_types' method which returns a sequence of
types corresponding to the arguments the xmethod requires.  GDB uses
this sequence of types to perform overload resolution and picks a
winning xmethod worker.  A winner is also selected from among the
methods GDB finds in the C++ source code.  Next, the winning xmethod
worker and the winning C++ method are compared to select an overall
winner.  In case of a tie between a xmethod worker and a C++ method, the
xmethod worker is selected as the winner.  That is, if a winning xmethod
worker is found to be equivalent to the winning C++ method, then the
xmethod worker is treated as a replacement for the C++ method.  GDB uses
the overall winner to invoke the method.  If the winning xmethod worker
is the overall winner, then the corresponding xmethod is invoked via the
'invoke' method of the worker object.

   If one wants to implement an xmethod as a replacement for an existing
C++ method, then they have to implement an equivalent xmethod which has
exactly the same name and takes arguments of exactly the same type as
the C++ method.  If the user wants to invoke the C++ method even though
a replacement xmethod is available for that method, then they can
disable the xmethod.

23.2.2.13 Xmethod API
.....................

The GDB Python API provides classes, interfaces and functions to
implement, register and manipulate xmethods.  *Note Xmethods In
Python::.

   An xmethod matcher should be an instance of a class derived from
'XMethodMatcher' defined in the module 'gdb.xmethod', or an object with
similar interface and attributes.  An instance of 'XMethodMatcher' has
the following attributes:

 -- Variable: name
     The name of the matcher.

 -- Variable: enabled
     A boolean value indicating whether the matcher is enabled or
     disabled.

 -- Variable: methods
     A list of named methods managed by the matcher.  Each object in the
     list is an instance of the class 'XMethod' defined in the module
     'gdb.xmethod', or any object with the following attributes:

     'name'
          Name of the xmethod which should be unique for each xmethod
          managed by the matcher.

     'enabled'
          A boolean value indicating whether the xmethod is enabled or
          disabled.

     The class 'XMethod' is a convenience class with same attributes as
     above along with the following constructor:

      -- Function: XMethod.__init__ (self, name)
          Constructs an enabled xmethod with name NAME.

The 'XMethodMatcher' class has the following methods:

 -- Function: XMethodMatcher.__init__ (self, name)
     Constructs an enabled xmethod matcher with name NAME.  The
     'methods' attribute is initialized to 'None'.

 -- Function: XMethodMatcher.match (self, class_type, method_name)
     Derived classes should override this method.  It should return a
     xmethod worker object (or a sequence of xmethod worker objects)
     matching the CLASS_TYPE and METHOD_NAME.  CLASS_TYPE is a
     'gdb.Type' object, and METHOD_NAME is a string value.  If the
     matcher manages named methods as listed in its 'methods' attribute,
     then only those worker objects whose corresponding entries in the
     'methods' list are enabled should be returned.

   An xmethod worker should be an instance of a class derived from
'XMethodWorker' defined in the module 'gdb.xmethod', or support the
following interface:

 -- Function: XMethodWorker.get_arg_types (self)
     This method returns a sequence of 'gdb.Type' objects corresponding
     to the arguments that the xmethod takes.  It can return an empty
     sequence or 'None' if the xmethod does not take any arguments.  If
     the xmethod takes a single argument, then a single 'gdb.Type'
     object corresponding to it can be returned.

 -- Function: XMethodWorker.__call__ (self, *args)
     This is the method which does the _work_ of the xmethod.  The ARGS
     arguments is the tuple of arguments to the xmethod.  Each element
     in this tuple is a gdb.Value object.  The first element is always
     the 'this' pointer value.

   For GDB to lookup xmethods, the xmethod matchers should be registered
using the following function defined in the module 'gdb.xmethod':

 -- Function: register_xmethod_matcher (locus, matcher, replace=False)
     The 'matcher' is registered with 'locus', replacing an existing
     matcher with the same name as 'matcher' if 'replace' is 'True'.
     'locus' can be a 'gdb.Objfile' object (*note Objfiles In Python::),
     or a 'gdb.Progspace' object (*note Progspaces In Python::), or
     'None'.  If it is 'None', then 'matcher' is registered globally.

23.2.2.14 Writing an Xmethod
............................

Implementing xmethods in Python will require implementing xmethod
matchers and xmethod workers (*note Xmethods In Python::).  Consider the
following C++ class:

     class MyClass
     {
     public:
       MyClass (int a) : a_(a) { }

       int geta (void) { return a_; }
       int operator+ (int b);

     private:
       int a_;
     };

     int
     MyClass::operator+ (int b)
     {
       return a_ + b;
     }

Let us define two xmethods for the class 'MyClass', one replacing the
method 'geta', and another adding an overloaded flavor of 'operator+'
which takes a 'MyClass' argument (the C++ code above already has an
overloaded 'operator+' which takes an 'int' argument).  The xmethod
matcher can be defined as follows:

     class MyClass_geta(gdb.xmethod.XMethod):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethod.__init__(self, 'geta')

         def get_worker(self, method_name):
             if method_name == 'geta':
                 return MyClassWorker_geta()


     class MyClass_sum(gdb.xmethod.XMethod):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethod.__init__(self, 'sum')

         def get_worker(self, method_name):
             if method_name == 'operator+':
                 return MyClassWorker_plus()


     class MyClassMatcher(gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher.__init__(self, 'MyClassMatcher')
             # List of methods 'managed' by this matcher
             self.methods = [MyClass_geta(), MyClass_sum()]

         def match(self, class_type, method_name):
             if class_type.tag != 'MyClass':
                 return None
             workers = []
             for method in self.methods:
                 if method.enabled:
                     worker = method.get_worker(method_name)
                     if worker:
                         workers.append(worker)

             return workers

Notice that the 'match' method of 'MyClassMatcher' returns a worker
object of type 'MyClassWorker_geta' for the 'geta' method, and a worker
object of type 'MyClassWorker_plus' for the 'operator+' method.  This is
done indirectly via helper classes derived from 'gdb.xmethod.XMethod'.
One does not need to use the 'methods' attribute in a matcher as it is
optional.  However, if a matcher manages more than one xmethod, it is a
good practice to list the xmethods in the 'methods' attribute of the
matcher.  This will then facilitate enabling and disabling individual
xmethods via the 'enable/disable' commands.  Notice also that a worker
object is returned only if the corresponding entry in the 'methods'
attribute of the matcher is enabled.

   The implementation of the worker classes returned by the matcher
setup above is as follows:

     class MyClassWorker_geta(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
         def get_arg_types(self):
             return None

         def __call__(self, obj):
             return obj['a_']


     class MyClassWorker_plus(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
         def get_arg_types(self):
             return gdb.lookup_type('MyClass')

         def __call__(self, obj, other):
             return obj['a_'] + other['a_']

   For GDB to actually lookup a xmethod, it has to be registered with
it.  The matcher defined above is registered with GDB globally as
follows:

     gdb.xmethod.register_xmethod_matcher(None, MyClassMatcher())

   If an object 'obj' of type 'MyClass' is initialized in C++ code as
follows:

     MyClass obj(5);

then, after loading the Python script defining the xmethod matchers and
workers into 'GDBN', invoking the method 'geta' or using the operator
'+' on 'obj' will invoke the xmethods defined above:

     (gdb) p obj.geta()
     $1 = 5

     (gdb) p obj + obj
     $2 = 10

   Consider another example with a C++ template class:

     template <class T>
     class MyTemplate
     {
     public:
       MyTemplate () : dsize_(10), data_ (new T [10]) { }
       ~MyTemplate () { delete [] data_; }

       int footprint (void)
       {
         return sizeof (T) * dsize_ + sizeof (MyTemplate<T>);
       }

     private:
       int dsize_;
       T *data_;
     };

   Let us implement an xmethod for the above class which serves as a
replacement for the 'footprint' method.  The full code listing of the
xmethod workers and xmethod matchers is as follows:

     class MyTemplateWorker_footprint(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
         def __init__(self, class_type):
             self.class_type = class_type

         def get_arg_types(self):
             return None

         def __call__(self, obj):
             return (self.class_type.sizeof +
                     obj['dsize_'] *
                     self.class_type.template_argument(0).sizeof)


     class MyTemplateMatcher_footprint(gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher):
         def __init__(self):
             gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher.__init__(self, 'MyTemplateMatcher')

         def match(self, class_type, method_name):
             if (re.match('MyTemplate<[ \t\n]*[_a-zA-Z][ _a-zA-Z0-9]*>',
                          class_type.tag) and
                 method_name == 'footprint'):
                 return MyTemplateWorker_footprint(class_type)

   Notice that, in this example, we have not used the 'methods'
attribute of the matcher as the matcher manages only one xmethod.  The
user can enable/disable this xmethod by enabling/disabling the matcher
itself.

23.2.2.15 Inferiors In Python
.............................

Programs which are being run under GDB are called inferiors (*note
Inferiors and Programs::).  Python scripts can access information about
and manipulate inferiors controlled by GDB via objects of the
'gdb.Inferior' class.

   The following inferior-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.inferiors ()
     Return a tuple containing all inferior objects.

 -- Function: gdb.selected_inferior ()
     Return an object representing the current inferior.

   A 'gdb.Inferior' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Inferior.num
     ID of inferior, as assigned by GDB.

 -- Variable: Inferior.pid
     Process ID of the inferior, as assigned by the underlying operating
     system.

 -- Variable: Inferior.was_attached
     Boolean signaling whether the inferior was created using 'attach',
     or started by GDB itself.

   A 'gdb.Inferior' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Inferior.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Inferior' object is valid, 'False' if
     not.  A 'gdb.Inferior' object will become invalid if the inferior
     no longer exists within GDB.  All other 'gdb.Inferior' methods will
     throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is
     called.

 -- Function: Inferior.threads ()
     This method returns a tuple holding all the threads which are valid
     when it is called.  If there are no valid threads, the method will
     return an empty tuple.

 -- Function: Inferior.read_memory (address, length)
     Read LENGTH bytes of memory from the inferior, starting at ADDRESS.
     Returns a buffer object, which behaves much like an array or a
     string.  It can be modified and given to the
     'Inferior.write_memory' function.  In 'Python' 3, the return value
     is a 'memoryview' object.

 -- Function: Inferior.write_memory (address, buffer [, length])
     Write the contents of BUFFER to the inferior, starting at ADDRESS.
     The BUFFER parameter must be a Python object which supports the
     buffer protocol, i.e., a string, an array or the object returned
     from 'Inferior.read_memory'.  If given, LENGTH determines the
     number of bytes from BUFFER to be written.

 -- Function: Inferior.search_memory (address, length, pattern)
     Search a region of the inferior memory starting at ADDRESS with the
     given LENGTH using the search pattern supplied in PATTERN.  The
     PATTERN parameter must be a Python object which supports the buffer
     protocol, i.e., a string, an array or the object returned from
     'gdb.read_memory'.  Returns a Python 'Long' containing the address
     where the pattern was found, or 'None' if the pattern could not be
     found.

23.2.2.16 Events In Python
..........................

GDB provides a general event facility so that Python code can be
notified of various state changes, particularly changes that occur in
the inferior.

   An "event" is just an object that describes some state change.  The
type of the object and its attributes will vary depending on the details
of the change.  All the existing events are described below.

   In order to be notified of an event, you must register an event
handler with an "event registry".  An event registry is an object in the
'gdb.events' module which dispatches particular events.  A registry
provides methods to register and unregister event handlers:

 -- Function: EventRegistry.connect (object)
     Add the given callable OBJECT to the registry.  This object will be
     called when an event corresponding to this registry occurs.

 -- Function: EventRegistry.disconnect (object)
     Remove the given OBJECT from the registry.  Once removed, the
     object will no longer receive notifications of events.

   Here is an example:

     def exit_handler (event):
         print "event type: exit"
         print "exit code: %d" % (event.exit_code)

     gdb.events.exited.connect (exit_handler)

   In the above example we connect our handler 'exit_handler' to the
registry 'events.exited'.  Once connected, 'exit_handler' gets called
when the inferior exits.  The argument "event" in this example is of
type 'gdb.ExitedEvent'.  As you can see in the example the 'ExitedEvent'
object has an attribute which indicates the exit code of the inferior.

   The following is a listing of the event registries that are available
and details of the events they emit:

'events.cont'
     Emits 'gdb.ThreadEvent'.

     Some events can be thread specific when GDB is running in non-stop
     mode.  When represented in Python, these events all extend
     'gdb.ThreadEvent'.  Note, this event is not emitted directly;
     instead, events which are emitted by this or other modules might
     extend this event.  Examples of these events are
     'gdb.BreakpointEvent' and 'gdb.ContinueEvent'.

      -- Variable: ThreadEvent.inferior_thread
          In non-stop mode this attribute will be set to the specific
          thread which was involved in the emitted event.  Otherwise, it
          will be set to 'None'.

     Emits 'gdb.ContinueEvent' which extends 'gdb.ThreadEvent'.

     This event indicates that the inferior has been continued after a
     stop.  For inherited attribute refer to 'gdb.ThreadEvent' above.

'events.exited'
     Emits 'events.ExitedEvent' which indicates that the inferior has
     exited.  'events.ExitedEvent' has two attributes:
      -- Variable: ExitedEvent.exit_code
          An integer representing the exit code, if available, which the
          inferior has returned.  (The exit code could be unavailable
          if, for example, GDB detaches from the inferior.)  If the exit
          code is unavailable, the attribute does not exist.
      -- Variable: ExitedEvent inferior
          A reference to the inferior which triggered the 'exited'
          event.

'events.stop'
     Emits 'gdb.StopEvent' which extends 'gdb.ThreadEvent'.

     Indicates that the inferior has stopped.  All events emitted by
     this registry extend StopEvent.  As a child of 'gdb.ThreadEvent',
     'gdb.StopEvent' will indicate the stopped thread when GDB is
     running in non-stop mode.  Refer to 'gdb.ThreadEvent' above for
     more details.

     Emits 'gdb.SignalEvent' which extends 'gdb.StopEvent'.

     This event indicates that the inferior or one of its threads has
     received as signal.  'gdb.SignalEvent' has the following
     attributes:

      -- Variable: SignalEvent.stop_signal
          A string representing the signal received by the inferior.  A
          list of possible signal values can be obtained by running the
          command 'info signals' in the GDB command prompt.

     Also emits 'gdb.BreakpointEvent' which extends 'gdb.StopEvent'.

     'gdb.BreakpointEvent' event indicates that one or more breakpoints
     have been hit, and has the following attributes:

      -- Variable: BreakpointEvent.breakpoints
          A sequence containing references to all the breakpoints (type
          'gdb.Breakpoint') that were hit.  *Note Breakpoints In
          Python::, for details of the 'gdb.Breakpoint' object.
      -- Variable: BreakpointEvent.breakpoint
          A reference to the first breakpoint that was hit.  This
          function is maintained for backward compatibility and is now
          deprecated in favor of the 'gdb.BreakpointEvent.breakpoints'
          attribute.

'events.new_objfile'
     Emits 'gdb.NewObjFileEvent' which indicates that a new object file
     has been loaded by GDB.  'gdb.NewObjFileEvent' has one attribute:

      -- Variable: NewObjFileEvent.new_objfile
          A reference to the object file ('gdb.Objfile') which has been
          loaded.  *Note Objfiles In Python::, for details of the
          'gdb.Objfile' object.

23.2.2.17 Threads In Python
...........................

Python scripts can access information about, and manipulate inferior
threads controlled by GDB, via objects of the 'gdb.InferiorThread'
class.

   The following thread-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.selected_thread ()
     This function returns the thread object for the selected thread.
     If there is no selected thread, this will return 'None'.

   A 'gdb.InferiorThread' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: InferiorThread.name
     The name of the thread.  If the user specified a name using 'thread
     name', then this returns that name.  Otherwise, if an OS-supplied
     name is available, then it is returned.  Otherwise, this returns
     'None'.

     This attribute can be assigned to.  The new value must be a string
     object, which sets the new name, or 'None', which removes any
     user-specified thread name.

 -- Variable: InferiorThread.num
     ID of the thread, as assigned by GDB.

 -- Variable: InferiorThread.ptid
     ID of the thread, as assigned by the operating system.  This
     attribute is a tuple containing three integers.  The first is the
     Process ID (PID); the second is the Lightweight Process ID (LWPID),
     and the third is the Thread ID (TID). Either the LWPID or TID may
     be 0, which indicates that the operating system does not use that
     identifier.

   A 'gdb.InferiorThread' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.InferiorThread' object is valid, 'False'
     if not.  A 'gdb.InferiorThread' object will become invalid if the
     thread exits, or the inferior that the thread belongs is deleted.
     All other 'gdb.InferiorThread' methods will throw an exception if
     it is invalid at the time the method is called.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.switch ()
     This changes GDB's currently selected thread to the one represented
     by this object.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_stopped ()
     Return a Boolean indicating whether the thread is stopped.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_running ()
     Return a Boolean indicating whether the thread is running.

 -- Function: InferiorThread.is_exited ()
     Return a Boolean indicating whether the thread is exited.

23.2.2.18 Commands In Python
............................

You can implement new GDB CLI commands in Python.  A CLI command is
implemented using an instance of the 'gdb.Command' class, most commonly
using a subclass.

 -- Function: Command.__init__ (name, COMMAND_CLASS [, COMPLETER_CLASS
          [, PREFIX]])
     The object initializer for 'Command' registers the new command with
     GDB.  This initializer is normally invoked from the subclass' own
     '__init__' method.

     NAME is the name of the command.  If NAME consists of multiple
     words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix commands.
     In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not exist, an
     exception is raised.

     There is no support for multi-line commands.

     COMMAND_CLASS should be one of the 'COMMAND_' constants defined
     below.  This argument tells GDB how to categorize the new command
     in the help system.

     COMPLETER_CLASS is an optional argument.  If given, it should be
     one of the 'COMPLETE_' constants defined below.  This argument
     tells GDB how to perform completion for this command.  If not
     given, GDB will attempt to complete using the object's 'complete'
     method (see below); if no such method is found, an error will occur
     when completion is attempted.

     PREFIX is an optional argument.  If 'True', then the new command is
     a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be registered.

     The help text for the new command is taken from the Python
     documentation string for the command's class, if there is one.  If
     no documentation string is provided, the default value "This
     command is not documented."  is used.

 -- Function: Command.dont_repeat ()
     By default, a GDB command is repeated when the user enters a blank
     line at the command prompt.  A command can suppress this behavior
     by invoking the 'dont_repeat' method.  This is similar to the user
     command 'dont-repeat', see *note dont-repeat: Define.

 -- Function: Command.invoke (argument, from_tty)
     This method is called by GDB when this command is invoked.

     ARGUMENT is a string.  It is the argument to the command, after
     leading and trailing whitespace has been stripped.

     FROM_TTY is a boolean argument.  When true, this means that the
     command was entered by the user at the terminal; when false it
     means that the command came from elsewhere.

     If this method throws an exception, it is turned into a GDB 'error'
     call.  Otherwise, the return value is ignored.

     To break ARGUMENT up into an argv-like string use
     'gdb.string_to_argv'.  This function behaves identically to GDB's
     internal argument lexer 'buildargv'.  It is recommended to use this
     for consistency.  Arguments are separated by spaces and may be
     quoted.  Example:

          print gdb.string_to_argv ("1 2\ \\\"3 '4 \"5' \"6 '7\"")
          ['1', '2 "3', '4 "5', "6 '7"]

 -- Function: Command.complete (text, word)
     This method is called by GDB when the user attempts completion on
     this command.  All forms of completion are handled by this method,
     that is, the <TAB> and <M-?> key bindings (*note Completion::), and
     the 'complete' command (*note complete: Help.).

     The arguments TEXT and WORD are both strings; TEXT holds the
     complete command line up to the cursor's location, while WORD holds
     the last word of the command line; this is computed using a
     word-breaking heuristic.

     The 'complete' method can return several values:
        * If the return value is a sequence, the contents of the
          sequence are used as the completions.  It is up to 'complete'
          to ensure that the contents actually do complete the word.  A
          zero-length sequence is allowed, it means that there were no
          completions available.  Only string elements of the sequence
          are used; other elements in the sequence are ignored.

        * If the return value is one of the 'COMPLETE_' constants
          defined below, then the corresponding GDB-internal completion
          function is invoked, and its result is used.

        * All other results are treated as though there were no
          available completions.

   When a new command is registered, it must be declared as a member of
some general class of commands.  This is used to classify top-level
commands in the on-line help system; note that prefix commands are not
listed under their own category but rather that of their top-level
command.  The available classifications are represented by constants
defined in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.COMMAND_NONE'
     The command does not belong to any particular class.  A command in
     this category will not be displayed in any of the help categories.

'gdb.COMMAND_RUNNING'
     The command is related to running the inferior.  For example,
     'start', 'step', and 'continue' are in this category.  Type 'help
     running' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_DATA'
     The command is related to data or variables.  For example, 'call',
     'find', and 'print' are in this category.  Type 'help data' at the
     GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_STACK'
     The command has to do with manipulation of the stack.  For example,
     'backtrace', 'frame', and 'return' are in this category.  Type
     'help stack' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_FILES'
     This class is used for file-related commands.  For example, 'file',
     'list' and 'section' are in this category.  Type 'help files' at
     the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_SUPPORT'
     This should be used for "support facilities", generally meaning
     things that are useful to the user when interacting with GDB, but
     not related to the state of the inferior.  For example, 'help',
     'make', and 'shell' are in this category.  Type 'help support' at
     the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_STATUS'
     The command is an 'info'-related command, that is, related to the
     state of GDB itself.  For example, 'info', 'macro', and 'show' are
     in this category.  Type 'help status' at the GDB prompt to see a
     list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_BREAKPOINTS'
     The command has to do with breakpoints.  For example, 'break',
     'clear', and 'delete' are in this category.  Type 'help
     breakpoints' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_TRACEPOINTS'
     The command has to do with tracepoints.  For example, 'trace',
     'actions', and 'tfind' are in this category.  Type 'help
     tracepoints' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'gdb.COMMAND_USER'
     The command is a general purpose command for the user, and
     typically does not fit in one of the other categories.  Type 'help
     user-defined' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category, as well as the list of gdb macros (*note Sequences::).

'gdb.COMMAND_OBSCURE'
     The command is only used in unusual circumstances, or is not of
     general interest to users.  For example, 'checkpoint', 'fork', and
     'stop' are in this category.  Type 'help obscure' at the GDB prompt
     to see a list of commands in this category.

'gdb.COMMAND_MAINTENANCE'
     The command is only useful to GDB maintainers.  The 'maintenance'
     and 'flushregs' commands are in this category.  Type 'help
     internals' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

   A new command can use a predefined completion function, either by
specifying it via an argument at initialization, or by returning it from
the 'complete' method.  These predefined completion constants are all
defined in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.COMPLETE_NONE'
     This constant means that no completion should be done.

'gdb.COMPLETE_FILENAME'
     This constant means that filename completion should be performed.

'gdb.COMPLETE_LOCATION'
     This constant means that location completion should be done.  *Note
     Specify Location::.

'gdb.COMPLETE_COMMAND'
     This constant means that completion should examine GDB command
     names.

'gdb.COMPLETE_SYMBOL'
     This constant means that completion should be done using symbol
     names as the source.

'gdb.COMPLETE_EXPRESSION'
     This constant means that completion should be done on expressions.
     Often this means completing on symbol names, but some language
     parsers also have support for completing on field names.

   The following code snippet shows how a trivial CLI command can be
implemented in Python:

     class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
       """Greet the whole world."""

       def __init__ (self):
         super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ ("hello-world", gdb.COMMAND_USER)

       def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):
         print "Hello, World!"

     HelloWorld ()

   The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the command with GDB.  Depending on how the Python code
is read into GDB, you may need to import the 'gdb' module explicitly.

23.2.2.19 Parameters In Python
..............................

You can implement new GDB parameters using Python.  A new parameter is
implemented as an instance of the 'gdb.Parameter' class.

   Parameters are exposed to the user via the 'set' and 'show' commands.
*Note Help::.

   There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in GDB.
Two examples are: 'set follow fork' and 'set charset'.  Setting these
parameters influences certain behavior in GDB.  Similarly, you can
define parameters that can be used to influence behavior in custom
Python scripts and commands.

 -- Function: Parameter.__init__ (name, COMMAND-CLASS, PARAMETER-CLASS
          [, ENUM-SEQUENCE])
     The object initializer for 'Parameter' registers the new parameter
     with GDB.  This initializer is normally invoked from the subclass'
     own '__init__' method.

     NAME is the name of the new parameter.  If NAME consists of
     multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
     parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with the 'set
     print' set of parameters.  If NAME is 'print foo', then 'print'
     will be searched as the prefix parameter.  In this case the
     parameter can subsequently be accessed in GDB as 'set print foo'.

     If NAME consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
     can be found, an exception is raised.

     COMMAND-CLASS should be one of the 'COMMAND_' constants (*note
     Commands In Python::).  This argument tells GDB how to categorize
     the new parameter in the help system.

     PARAMETER-CLASS should be one of the 'PARAM_' constants defined
     below.  This argument tells GDB the type of the new parameter; this
     information is used for input validation and completion.

     If PARAMETER-CLASS is 'PARAM_ENUM', then ENUM-SEQUENCE must be a
     sequence of strings.  These strings represent the possible values
     for the parameter.

     If PARAMETER-CLASS is not 'PARAM_ENUM', then the presence of a
     fourth argument will cause an exception to be thrown.

     The help text for the new parameter is taken from the Python
     documentation string for the parameter's class, if there is one.
     If there is no documentation string, a default value is used.

 -- Variable: Parameter.set_doc
     If this attribute exists, and is a string, then its value is used
     as the help text for this parameter's 'set' command.  The value is
     examined when 'Parameter.__init__' is invoked; subsequent changes
     have no effect.

 -- Variable: Parameter.show_doc
     If this attribute exists, and is a string, then its value is used
     as the help text for this parameter's 'show' command.  The value is
     examined when 'Parameter.__init__' is invoked; subsequent changes
     have no effect.

 -- Variable: Parameter.value
     The 'value' attribute holds the underlying value of the parameter.
     It can be read and assigned to just as any other attribute.  GDB
     does validation when assignments are made.

   There are two methods that should be implemented in any 'Parameter'
class.  These are:

 -- Function: Parameter.get_set_string (self)
     GDB will call this method when a PARAMETER's value has been changed
     via the 'set' API (for example, 'set foo off').  The 'value'
     attribute has already been populated with the new value and may be
     used in output.  This method must return a string.

 -- Function: Parameter.get_show_string (self, svalue)
     GDB will call this method when a PARAMETER's 'show' API has been
     invoked (for example, 'show foo').  The argument 'svalue' receives
     the string representation of the current value.  This method must
     return a string.

   When a new parameter is defined, its type must be specified.  The
available types are represented by constants defined in the 'gdb'
module:

'gdb.PARAM_BOOLEAN'
     The value is a plain boolean.  The Python boolean values, 'True'
     and 'False' are the only valid values.

'gdb.PARAM_AUTO_BOOLEAN'
     The value has three possible states: true, false, and 'auto'.  In
     Python, true and false are represented using boolean constants, and
     'auto' is represented using 'None'.

'gdb.PARAM_UINTEGER'
     The value is an unsigned integer.  The value of 0 should be
     interpreted to mean "unlimited".

'gdb.PARAM_INTEGER'
     The value is a signed integer.  The value of 0 should be
     interpreted to mean "unlimited".

'gdb.PARAM_STRING'
     The value is a string.  When the user modifies the string, any
     escape sequences, such as '\t', '\f', and octal escapes, are
     translated into corresponding characters and encoded into the
     current host charset.

'gdb.PARAM_STRING_NOESCAPE'
     The value is a string.  When the user modifies the string, escapes
     are passed through untranslated.

'gdb.PARAM_OPTIONAL_FILENAME'
     The value is a either a filename (a string), or 'None'.

'gdb.PARAM_FILENAME'
     The value is a filename.  This is just like
     'PARAM_STRING_NOESCAPE', but uses file names for completion.

'gdb.PARAM_ZINTEGER'
     The value is an integer.  This is like 'PARAM_INTEGER', except 0 is
     interpreted as itself.

'gdb.PARAM_ENUM'
     The value is a string, which must be one of a collection string
     constants provided when the parameter is created.

23.2.2.20 Writing new convenience functions
...........................................

You can implement new convenience functions (*note Convenience Vars::)
in Python.  A convenience function is an instance of a subclass of the
class 'gdb.Function'.

 -- Function: Function.__init__ (name)
     The initializer for 'Function' registers the new function with GDB.
     The argument NAME is the name of the function, a string.  The
     function will be visible to the user as a convenience variable of
     type 'internal function', whose name is the same as the given NAME.

     The documentation for the new function is taken from the
     documentation string for the new class.

 -- Function: Function.invoke (*ARGS)
     When a convenience function is evaluated, its arguments are
     converted to instances of 'gdb.Value', and then the function's
     'invoke' method is called.  Note that GDB does not predetermine the
     arity of convenience functions.  Instead, all available arguments
     are passed to 'invoke', following the standard Python calling
     convention.  In particular, a convenience function can have default
     values for parameters without ill effect.

     The return value of this method is used as its value in the
     enclosing expression.  If an ordinary Python value is returned, it
     is converted to a 'gdb.Value' following the usual rules.

   The following code snippet shows how a trivial convenience function
can be implemented in Python:

     class Greet (gdb.Function):
       """Return string to greet someone.
     Takes a name as argument."""

       def __init__ (self):
         super (Greet, self).__init__ ("greet")

       def invoke (self, name):
         return "Hello, %s!" % name.string ()

     Greet ()

   The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the function with GDB.  Depending on how the Python code
is read into GDB, you may need to import the 'gdb' module explicitly.

   Now you can use the function in an expression:

     (gdb) print $greet("Bob")
     $1 = "Hello, Bob!"


File: gdb.info,  Node: Progspaces In Python,  Next: Objfiles In Python,  Prev: Functions In Python,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.21 Program Spaces In Python
..................................

A program space, or "progspace", represents a symbolic view of an
address space.  It consists of all of the objfiles of the program.
*Note Objfiles In Python::.  *Note program spaces: Inferiors and
Programs, for more details about program spaces.

   The following progspace-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.current_progspace ()
     This function returns the program space of the currently selected
     inferior.  *Note Inferiors and Programs::.

 -- Function: gdb.progspaces ()
     Return a sequence of all the progspaces currently known to GDB.

   Each progspace is represented by an instance of the 'gdb.Progspace'
class.

 -- Variable: Progspace.filename
     The file name of the progspace as a string.

 -- Variable: Progspace.pretty_printers
     The 'pretty_printers' attribute is a list of functions.  It is used
     to look up pretty-printers.  A 'Value' is passed to each function
     in order; if the function returns 'None', then the search
     continues.  Otherwise, the return value should be an object which
     is used to format the value.  *Note Pretty Printing API::, for more
     information.

 -- Variable: Progspace.type_printers
     The 'type_printers' attribute is a list of type printer objects.
     *Note Type Printing API::, for more information.

 -- Variable: Progspace.frame_filters
     The 'frame_filters' attribute is a dictionary of frame filter
     objects.  *Note Frame Filter API::, for more information.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Objfiles In Python,  Next: Frames In Python,  Prev: Progspaces In Python,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.22 Objfiles In Python
............................

GDB loads symbols for an inferior from various symbol-containing files
(*note Files::).  These include the primary executable file, any shared
libraries used by the inferior, and any separate debug info files (*note
Separate Debug Files::).  GDB calls these symbol-containing files
"objfiles".

   The following objfile-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.current_objfile ()
     When auto-loading a Python script (*note Python Auto-loading::),
     GDB sets the "current objfile" to the corresponding objfile.  This
     function returns the current objfile.  If there is no current
     objfile, this function returns 'None'.

 -- Function: gdb.objfiles ()
     Return a sequence of all the objfiles current known to GDB.  *Note
     Objfiles In Python::.

   Each objfile is represented by an instance of the 'gdb.Objfile'
class.

 -- Variable: Objfile.filename
     The file name of the objfile as a string.

 -- Variable: Objfile.pretty_printers
     The 'pretty_printers' attribute is a list of functions.  It is used
     to look up pretty-printers.  A 'Value' is passed to each function
     in order; if the function returns 'None', then the search
     continues.  Otherwise, the return value should be an object which
     is used to format the value.  *Note Pretty Printing API::, for more
     information.

 -- Variable: Objfile.type_printers
     The 'type_printers' attribute is a list of type printer objects.
     *Note Type Printing API::, for more information.

 -- Variable: Objfile.frame_filters
     The 'frame_filters' attribute is a dictionary of frame filter
     objects.  *Note Frame Filter API::, for more information.

   A 'gdb.Objfile' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Objfile.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Objfile' object is valid, 'False' if
     not.  A 'gdb.Objfile' object can become invalid if the object file
     it refers to is not loaded in GDB any longer.  All other
     'gdb.Objfile' methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at
     the time the method is called.

23.2.2.23 Accessing inferior stack frames from Python.
......................................................

When the debugged program stops, GDB is able to analyze its call stack
(*note Stack frames: Frames.).  The 'gdb.Frame' class represents a frame
in the stack.  A 'gdb.Frame' object is only valid while its
corresponding frame exists in the inferior's stack.  If you try to use
an invalid frame object, GDB will throw a 'gdb.error' exception (*note
Exception Handling::).

   Two 'gdb.Frame' objects can be compared for equality with the '=='
operator, like:

     (gdb) python print gdb.newest_frame() == gdb.selected_frame ()
     True

   The following frame-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.selected_frame ()
     Return the selected frame object.  (*note Selecting a Frame:
     Selection.).

 -- Function: gdb.newest_frame ()
     Return the newest frame object for the selected thread.

 -- Function: gdb.frame_stop_reason_string (reason)
     Return a string explaining the reason why GDB stopped unwinding
     frames, as expressed by the given REASON code (an integer, see the
     'unwind_stop_reason' method further down in this section).

   A 'gdb.Frame' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Frame.is_valid ()
     Returns true if the 'gdb.Frame' object is valid, false if not.  A
     frame object can become invalid if the frame it refers to doesn't
     exist anymore in the inferior.  All 'gdb.Frame' methods will throw
     an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is called.

 -- Function: Frame.name ()
     Returns the function name of the frame, or 'None' if it can't be
     obtained.

 -- Function: Frame.architecture ()
     Returns the 'gdb.Architecture' object corresponding to the frame's
     architecture.  *Note Architectures In Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.type ()
     Returns the type of the frame.  The value can be one of:
     'gdb.NORMAL_FRAME'
          An ordinary stack frame.

     'gdb.DUMMY_FRAME'
          A fake stack frame that was created by GDB when performing an
          inferior function call.

     'gdb.INLINE_FRAME'
          A frame representing an inlined function.  The function was
          inlined into a 'gdb.NORMAL_FRAME' that is older than this one.

     'gdb.TAILCALL_FRAME'
          A frame representing a tail call.  *Note Tail Call Frames::.

     'gdb.SIGTRAMP_FRAME'
          A signal trampoline frame.  This is the frame created by the
          OS when it calls into a signal handler.

     'gdb.ARCH_FRAME'
          A fake stack frame representing a cross-architecture call.

     'gdb.SENTINEL_FRAME'
          This is like 'gdb.NORMAL_FRAME', but it is only used for the
          newest frame.

 -- Function: Frame.unwind_stop_reason ()
     Return an integer representing the reason why it's not possible to
     find more frames toward the outermost frame.  Use
     'gdb.frame_stop_reason_string' to convert the value returned by
     this function to a string.  The value can be one of:

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_NO_REASON'
          No particular reason (older frames should be available).

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_NULL_ID'
          The previous frame's analyzer returns an invalid result.  This
          is no longer used by GDB, and is kept only for backward
          compatibility.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_OUTERMOST'
          This frame is the outermost.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_UNAVAILABLE'
          Cannot unwind further, because that would require knowing the
          values of registers or memory that have not been collected.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_INNER_ID'
          This frame ID looks like it ought to belong to a NEXT frame,
          but we got it for a PREV frame.  Normally, this is a sign of
          unwinder failure.  It could also indicate stack corruption.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_SAME_ID'
          This frame has the same ID as the previous one.  That means
          that unwinding further would almost certainly give us another
          frame with exactly the same ID, so break the chain.  Normally,
          this is a sign of unwinder failure.  It could also indicate
          stack corruption.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_NO_SAVED_PC'
          The frame unwinder did not find any saved PC, but we needed
          one to unwind further.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_MEMORY_ERROR'
          The frame unwinder caused an error while trying to access
          memory.

     'gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_FIRST_ERROR'
          Any stop reason greater or equal to this value indicates some
          kind of error.  This special value facilitates writing code
          that tests for errors in unwinding in a way that will work
          correctly even if the list of the other values is modified in
          future GDB versions.  Using it, you could write:
               reason = gdb.selected_frame().unwind_stop_reason ()
               reason_str =  gdb.frame_stop_reason_string (reason)
               if reason >=  gdb.FRAME_UNWIND_FIRST_ERROR:
                   print "An error occured: %s" % reason_str

 -- Function: Frame.pc ()
     Returns the frame's resume address.

 -- Function: Frame.block ()
     Return the frame's code block.  *Note Blocks In Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.function ()
     Return the symbol for the function corresponding to this frame.
     *Note Symbols In Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.older ()
     Return the frame that called this frame.

 -- Function: Frame.newer ()
     Return the frame called by this frame.

 -- Function: Frame.find_sal ()
     Return the frame's symtab and line object.  *Note Symbol Tables In
     Python::.

 -- Function: Frame.read_var (variable [, block])
     Return the value of VARIABLE in this frame.  If the optional
     argument BLOCK is provided, search for the variable from that
     block; otherwise start at the frame's current block (which is
     determined by the frame's current program counter).  The VARIABLE
     argument must be a string or a 'gdb.Symbol' object; BLOCK must be a
     'gdb.Block' object.

23.2.2.24 Accessing blocks from Python.
.......................................

In GDB, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds roughly to a
scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized hierarchically, and are
represented individually in Python as a 'gdb.Block'.  Blocks rely on
debugging information being available.

   A frame has a block.  Please see *note Frames In Python::, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.

   The outermost block is known as the "global block".  The global block
typically holds public global variables and functions.

   The block nested just inside the global block is the "static block".
The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and functions.

   GDB provides a method to get a block's superblock, but there is
currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to iterate
over all the blocks in a symbol table (*note Symbol Tables In Python::).

   Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:

     /* This is in the global block.  */
     int global;

     /* This is in the static block.  */
     static int file_scope;

     /* 'function' is in the global block, and 'argument' is
        in a block nested inside of 'function'.  */
     int function (int argument)
     {
       /* 'local' is in a block inside 'function'.  It may or may
          not be in the same block as 'argument'.  */
       int local;

       {
          /* 'inner' is in a block whose superblock is the one holding
             'local'.  */
          int inner;

          /* If this call is expanded by the compiler, you may see
             a nested block here whose function is 'inline_function'
             and whose superblock is the one holding 'inner'.  */
          inline_function ();
       }
     }

   A 'gdb.Block' is iterable.  The iterator returns the symbols (*note
Symbols In Python::) local to the block.  Python programs should not
assume that a specific block object will always contain a given symbol,
since changes in GDB features and infrastructure may cause symbols move
across blocks in a symbol table.

   The following block-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.block_for_pc (pc)
     Return the innermost 'gdb.Block' containing the given PC value.  If
     the block cannot be found for the PC value specified, the function
     will return 'None'.

   A 'gdb.Block' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Block.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Block' object is valid, 'False' if not.
     A block object can become invalid if the block it refers to doesn't
     exist anymore in the inferior.  All other 'gdb.Block' methods will
     throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is
     called.  The block's validity is also checked during iteration over
     symbols of the block.

   A 'gdb.Block' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Block.start
     The start address of the block.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Block.end
     The end address of the block.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Block.function
     The name of the block represented as a 'gdb.Symbol'.  If the block
     is not named, then this attribute holds 'None'.  This attribute is
     not writable.

     For ordinary function blocks, the superblock is the static block.
     However, you should note that it is possible for a function block
     to have a superblock that is not the static block - for instance
     this happens for an inlined function.

 -- Variable: Block.superblock
     The block containing this block.  If this parent block does not
     exist, this attribute holds 'None'.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Block.global_block
     The global block associated with this block.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Block.static_block
     The static block associated with this block.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Block.is_global
     'True' if the 'gdb.Block' object is a global block, 'False' if not.
     This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Block.is_static
     'True' if the 'gdb.Block' object is a static block, 'False' if not.
     This attribute is not writable.

23.2.2.25 Python representation of Symbols.
...........................................

GDB represents every variable, function and type as an entry in a symbol
table.  *Note Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols.  Similarly, Python
represents these symbols in GDB with the 'gdb.Symbol' object.

   The following symbol-related functions are available in the 'gdb'
module:

 -- Function: gdb.lookup_symbol (name [, block [, domain]])
     This function searches for a symbol by name.  The search scope can
     be restricted to the parameters defined in the optional domain and
     block arguments.

     NAME is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The optional
     BLOCK argument restricts the search to symbols visible in that
     BLOCK.  The BLOCK argument must be a 'gdb.Block' object.  If
     omitted, the block for the current frame is used.  The optional
     DOMAIN argument restricts the search to the domain type.  The
     DOMAIN argument must be a domain constant defined in the 'gdb'
     module and described later in this chapter.

     The result is a tuple of two elements.  The first element is a
     'gdb.Symbol' object or 'None' if the symbol is not found.  If the
     symbol is found, the second element is 'True' if the symbol is a
     field of a method's object (e.g., 'this' in C++), otherwise it is
     'False'.  If the symbol is not found, the second element is
     'False'.

 -- Function: gdb.lookup_global_symbol (name [, domain])
     This function searches for a global symbol by name.  The search
     scope can be restricted to by the domain argument.

     NAME is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The optional
     DOMAIN argument restricts the search to the domain type.  The
     DOMAIN argument must be a domain constant defined in the 'gdb'
     module and described later in this chapter.

     The result is a 'gdb.Symbol' object or 'None' if the symbol is not
     found.

   A 'gdb.Symbol' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Symbol.type
     The type of the symbol or 'None' if no type is recorded.  This
     attribute is represented as a 'gdb.Type' object.  *Note Types In
     Python::.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.symtab
     The symbol table in which the symbol appears.  This attribute is
     represented as a 'gdb.Symtab' object.  *Note Symbol Tables In
     Python::.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.line
     The line number in the source code at which the symbol was defined.
     This is an integer.

 -- Variable: Symbol.name
     The name of the symbol as a string.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.linkage_name
     The name of the symbol, as used by the linker (i.e., may be
     mangled).  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symbol.print_name
     The name of the symbol in a form suitable for output.  This is
     either 'name' or 'linkage_name', depending on whether the user
     asked GDB to display demangled or mangled names.

 -- Variable: Symbol.addr_class
     The address class of the symbol.  This classifies how to find the
     value of a symbol.  Each address class is a constant defined in the
     'gdb' module and described later in this chapter.

 -- Variable: Symbol.needs_frame
     This is 'True' if evaluating this symbol's value requires a frame
     (*note Frames In Python::) and 'False' otherwise.  Typically, local
     variables will require a frame, but other symbols will not.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_argument
     'True' if the symbol is an argument of a function.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_constant
     'True' if the symbol is a constant.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_function
     'True' if the symbol is a function or a method.

 -- Variable: Symbol.is_variable
     'True' if the symbol is a variable.

   A 'gdb.Symbol' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Symbol.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Symbol' object is valid, 'False' if not.
     A 'gdb.Symbol' object can become invalid if the symbol it refers to
     does not exist in GDB any longer.  All other 'gdb.Symbol' methods
     will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is
     called.

 -- Function: Symbol.value ([frame])
     Compute the value of the symbol, as a 'gdb.Value'.  For functions,
     this computes the address of the function, cast to the appropriate
     type.  If the symbol requires a frame in order to compute its
     value, then FRAME must be given.  If FRAME is not given, or if
     FRAME is invalid, then this method will throw an exception.

   The available domain categories in 'gdb.Symbol' are represented as
constants in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.SYMBOL_UNDEF_DOMAIN'
     This is used when a domain has not been discovered or none of the
     following domains apply.  This usually indicates an error either in
     the symbol information or in GDB's handling of symbols.

'gdb.SYMBOL_VAR_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains variables, function names, typedef names and
     enum type values.

'gdb.SYMBOL_STRUCT_DOMAIN'
     This domain holds struct, union and enum type names.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LABEL_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains names of labels (for gotos).

'gdb.SYMBOL_VARIABLES_DOMAIN'
     This domain holds a subset of the 'SYMBOLS_VAR_DOMAIN'; it contains
     everything minus functions and types.

'gdb.SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains all functions.

'gdb.SYMBOL_TYPES_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains all types.

   The available address class categories in 'gdb.Symbol' are
represented as constants in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_UNDEF'
     If this is returned by address class, it indicates an error either
     in the symbol information or in GDB's handling of symbols.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_CONST'
     Value is constant int.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_STATIC'
     Value is at a fixed address.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_REGISTER'
     Value is in a register.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_ARG'
     Value is an argument.  This value is at the offset stored within
     the symbol inside the frame's argument list.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_REF_ARG'
     Value address is stored in the frame's argument list.  Just like
     'LOC_ARG' except that the value's address is stored at the offset,
     not the value itself.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_REGPARM_ADDR'
     Value is a specified register.  Just like 'LOC_REGISTER' except the
     register holds the address of the argument instead of the argument
     itself.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_LOCAL'
     Value is a local variable.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_TYPEDEF'
     Value not used.  Symbols in the domain 'SYMBOL_STRUCT_DOMAIN' all
     have this class.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_BLOCK'
     Value is a block.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_CONST_BYTES'
     Value is a byte-sequence.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_UNRESOLVED'
     Value is at a fixed address, but the address of the variable has to
     be determined from the minimal symbol table whenever the variable
     is referenced.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_OPTIMIZED_OUT'
     The value does not actually exist in the program.

'gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_COMPUTED'
     The value's address is a computed location.

23.2.2.26 Symbol table representation in Python.
................................................

Access to symbol table data maintained by GDB on the inferior is exposed
to Python via two objects: 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' and 'gdb.Symtab'.
Symbol table and line data for a frame is returned from the 'find_sal'
method in 'gdb.Frame' object.  *Note Frames In Python::.

   For more information on GDB's symbol table management, see *note
Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols, for more information.

   A 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.symtab
     The symbol table object ('gdb.Symtab') for this frame.  This
     attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.pc
     Indicates the start of the address range occupied by code for the
     current source line.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.last
     Indicates the end of the address range occupied by code for the
     current source line.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab_and_line.line
     Indicates the current line number for this object.  This attribute
     is not writable.

   A 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Symtab_and_line.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object is valid,
     'False' if not.  A 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' object can become invalid
     if the Symbol table and line object it refers to does not exist in
     GDB any longer.  All other 'gdb.Symtab_and_line' methods will throw
     an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is called.

   A 'gdb.Symtab' object has the following attributes:

 -- Variable: Symtab.filename
     The symbol table's source filename.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Symtab.objfile
     The symbol table's backing object file.  *Note Objfiles In
     Python::.  This attribute is not writable.

   A 'gdb.Symtab' object has the following methods:

 -- Function: Symtab.is_valid ()
     Returns 'True' if the 'gdb.Symtab' object is valid, 'False' if not.
     A 'gdb.Symtab' object can become invalid if the symbol table it
     refers to does not exist in GDB any longer.  All other 'gdb.Symtab'
     methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the
     method is called.

 -- Function: Symtab.fullname ()
     Return the symbol table's source absolute file name.

 -- Function: Symtab.global_block ()
     Return the global block of the underlying symbol table.  *Note
     Blocks In Python::.

 -- Function: Symtab.static_block ()
     Return the static block of the underlying symbol table.  *Note
     Blocks In Python::.

 -- Function: Symtab.linetable ()
     Return the line table associated with the symbol table.  *Note Line
     Tables In Python::.

23.2.2.27 Manipulating line tables using Python
...............................................

Python code can request and inspect line table information from a symbol
table that is loaded in GDB.  A line table is a mapping of source lines
to their executable locations in memory.  To acquire the line table
information for a particular symbol table, use the 'linetable' function
(*note Symbol Tables In Python::).

   A 'gdb.LineTable' is iterable.  The iterator returns 'LineTableEntry'
objects that correspond to the source line and address for each line
table entry.  'LineTableEntry' objects have the following attributes:

 -- Variable: LineTableEntry.line
     The source line number for this line table entry.  This number
     corresponds to the actual line of source.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: LineTableEntry.pc
     The address that is associated with the line table entry where the
     executable code for that source line resides in memory.  This
     attribute is not writable.

   As there can be multiple addresses for a single source line, you may
receive multiple 'LineTableEntry' objects with matching 'line'
attributes, but with different 'pc' attributes.  The iterator is sorted
in ascending 'pc' order.  Here is a small example illustrating iterating
over a line table.

     symtab = gdb.selected_frame().find_sal().symtab
     linetable = symtab.linetable()
     for line in linetable:
        print "Line: "+str(line.line)+" Address: "+hex(line.pc)

   This will have the following output:

     Line: 33 Address: 0x4005c8L
     Line: 37 Address: 0x4005caL
     Line: 39 Address: 0x4005d2L
     Line: 40 Address: 0x4005f8L
     Line: 42 Address: 0x4005ffL
     Line: 44 Address: 0x400608L
     Line: 42 Address: 0x40060cL
     Line: 45 Address: 0x400615L

   In addition to being able to iterate over a 'LineTable', it also has
the following direct access methods:

 -- Function: LineTable.line (line)
     Return a Python 'Tuple' of 'LineTableEntry' objects for any entries
     in the line table for the given LINE, which specifies the source
     code line.  If there are no entries for that source code LINE, the
     Python 'None' is returned.

 -- Function: LineTable.has_line (line)
     Return a Python 'Boolean' indicating whether there is an entry in
     the line table for this source line.  Return 'True' if an entry is
     found, or 'False' if not.

 -- Function: LineTable.source_lines ()
     Return a Python 'List' of the source line numbers in the symbol
     table.  Only lines with executable code locations are returned.
     The contents of the 'List' will just be the source line entries
     represented as Python 'Long' values.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Breakpoints In Python,  Next: Finish Breakpoints in Python,  Prev: Line Tables In Python,  Up: Python API

23.2.2.28 Manipulating breakpoints using Python
...............................................

Python code can manipulate breakpoints via the 'gdb.Breakpoint' class.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.__init__ (spec [, type [, wp_class [,internal
          [,temporary]]]])
     Create a new breakpoint according to SPEC, which is a string naming
     the location of the breakpoint, or an expression that defines a
     watchpoint.  The contents can be any location recognized by the
     'break' command, or in the case of a watchpoint, by the 'watch'
     command.  The optional TYPE denotes the breakpoint to create from
     the types defined later in this chapter.  This argument can be
     either 'gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT' or 'gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT'; it defaults to
     'gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT'.  The optional INTERNAL argument allows the
     breakpoint to become invisible to the user.  The breakpoint will
     neither be reported when created, nor will it be listed in the
     output from 'info breakpoints' (but will be listed with the 'maint
     info breakpoints' command).  The optional TEMPORARY argument makes
     the breakpoint a temporary breakpoint.  Temporary breakpoints are
     deleted after they have been hit.  Any further access to the Python
     breakpoint after it has been hit will result in a runtime error (as
     that breakpoint has now been automatically deleted).  The optional
     WP_CLASS argument defines the class of watchpoint to create, if
     TYPE is 'gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT'.  If a watchpoint class is not
     provided, it is assumed to be a 'gdb.WP_WRITE' class.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.stop (self)
     The 'gdb.Breakpoint' class can be sub-classed and, in particular,
     you may choose to implement the 'stop' method.  If this method is
     defined in a sub-class of 'gdb.Breakpoint', it will be called when
     the inferior reaches any location of a breakpoint which
     instantiates that sub-class.  If the method returns 'True', the
     inferior will be stopped at the location of the breakpoint,
     otherwise the inferior will continue.

     If there are multiple breakpoints at the same location with a
     'stop' method, each one will be called regardless of the return
     status of the previous.  This ensures that all 'stop' methods have
     a chance to execute at that location.  In this scenario if one of
     the methods returns 'True' but the others return 'False', the
     inferior will still be stopped.

     You should not alter the execution state of the inferior (i.e.,
     step, next, etc.), alter the current frame context (i.e., change
     the current active frame), or alter, add or delete any breakpoint.
     As a general rule, you should not alter any data within GDB or the
     inferior at this time.

     Example 'stop' implementation:

          class MyBreakpoint (gdb.Breakpoint):
                def stop (self):
                  inf_val = gdb.parse_and_eval("foo")
                  if inf_val == 3:
                    return True
                  return False

   The available watchpoint types represented by constants are defined
in the 'gdb' module:

'gdb.WP_READ'
     Read only watchpoint.

'gdb.WP_WRITE'
     Write only watchpoint.

'gdb.WP_ACCESS'
     Read/Write watchpoint.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.is_valid ()
     Return 'True' if this 'Breakpoint' object is valid, 'False'
     otherwise.  A 'Breakpoint' object can become invalid if the user
     deletes the breakpoint.  In this case, the object still exists, but
     the underlying breakpoint does not.  In the cases of watchpoint
     scope, the watchpoint remains valid even if execution of the
     inferior leaves the scope of that watchpoint.

 -- Function: Breakpoint.delete
     Permanently deletes the GDB breakpoint.  This also invalidates the
     Python 'Breakpoint' object.  Any further access to this object's
     attributes or methods will raise an error.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.enabled
     This attribute is 'True' if the breakpoint is enabled, and 'False'
     otherwise.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.silent
     This attribute is 'True' if the breakpoint is silent, and 'False'
     otherwise.  This attribute is writable.

     Note that a breakpoint can also be silent if it has commands and
     the first command is 'silent'.  This is not reported by the
     'silent' attribute.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.thread
     If the breakpoint is thread-specific, this attribute holds the
     thread id.  If the breakpoint is not thread-specific, this
     attribute is 'None'.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.task
     If the breakpoint is Ada task-specific, this attribute holds the
     Ada task id.  If the breakpoint is not task-specific (or the
     underlying language is not Ada), this attribute is 'None'.  This
     attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.ignore_count
     This attribute holds the ignore count for the breakpoint, an
     integer.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.number
     This attribute holds the breakpoint's number -- the identifier used
     by the user to manipulate the breakpoint.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.type
     This attribute holds the breakpoint's type -- the identifier used
     to determine the actual breakpoint type or use-case.  This
     attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.visible
     This attribute tells whether the breakpoint is visible to the user
     when set, or when the 'info breakpoints' command is run.  This
     attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.temporary
     This attribute indicates whether the breakpoint was created as a
     temporary breakpoint.  Temporary breakpoints are automatically
     deleted after that breakpoint has been hit.  Access to this
     attribute, and all other attributes and functions other than the
     'is_valid' function, will result in an error after the breakpoint
     has been hit (as it has been automatically deleted).  This
     attribute is not writable.

   The available types are represented by constants defined in the 'gdb'
module:

'gdb.BP_BREAKPOINT'
     Normal code breakpoint.

'gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT'
     Watchpoint breakpoint.

'gdb.BP_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINT'
     Hardware assisted watchpoint.

'gdb.BP_READ_WATCHPOINT'
     Hardware assisted read watchpoint.

'gdb.BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT'
     Hardware assisted access watchpoint.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.hit_count
     This attribute holds the hit count for the breakpoint, an integer.
     This attribute is writable, but currently it can only be set to
     zero.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.location
     This attribute holds the location of the breakpoint, as specified
     by the user.  It is a string.  If the breakpoint does not have a
     location (that is, it is a watchpoint) the attribute's value is
     'None'.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.expression
     This attribute holds a breakpoint expression, as specified by the
     user.  It is a string.  If the breakpoint does not have an
     expression (the breakpoint is not a watchpoint) the attribute's
     value is 'None'.  This attribute is not writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.condition
     This attribute holds the condition of the breakpoint, as specified
     by the user.  It is a string.  If there is no condition, this
     attribute's value is 'None'.  This attribute is writable.

 -- Variable: Breakpoint.commands
     This attribute holds the commands attached to the breakpoint.  If
     there are commands, this attribute's value is a string holding all
     the commands, separated by newlines.  If there are no commands,
     this attribute is 'None'.  This attribute is not writable.

23.2.2.29 Finish Breakpoints
............................

A finish breakpoint is a temporary breakpoint set at the return address
of a frame, based on the 'finish' command.  'gdb.FinishBreakpoint'
extends 'gdb.Breakpoint'.  The underlying breakpoint will be disabled
and deleted when the execution will run out of the breakpoint scope
(i.e. 'Breakpoint.stop' or 'FinishBreakpoint.out_of_scope' triggered).
Finish breakpoints are thread specific and must be create with the right
thread selected.

 -- Function: FinishBreakpoint.__init__ ([frame] [, internal])
     Create a finish breakpoint at the return address of the 'gdb.Frame'
     object FRAME.  If FRAME is not provided, this defaults to the
     newest frame.  The optional INTERNAL argument allows the breakpoint
     to become invisible to the user.  *Note Breakpoints In Python::,
     for further details about this argument.

 -- Function: FinishBreakpoint.out_of_scope (self)
     In some circumstances (e.g. 'longjmp', C++ exceptions, GDB 'return'
     command, ...), a function may not properly terminate, and thus
     never hit the finish breakpoint.  When GDB notices such a
     situation, the 'out_of_scope' callback will be triggered.

     You may want to sub-class 'gdb.FinishBreakpoint' and override this
     method:

          class MyFinishBreakpoint (gdb.FinishBreakpoint)
              def stop (self):
                  print "normal finish"
                  return True

              def out_of_scope ():
                  print "abnormal finish"

 -- Variable: FinishBreakpoint.return_value
     When GDB is stopped at a finish breakpoint and the frame used to
     build the 'gdb.FinishBreakpoint' object had debug symbols, this
     attribute will contain a 'gdb.Value' object corresponding to the
     return value of the function.  The value will be 'None' if the
     function return type is 'void' or if the return value was not
     computable.  This attribute is not writable.

23.2.2.30 Python representation of lazy strings.
................................................

A "lazy string" is a string whose contents is not retrieved or encoded
until it is needed.

   A 'gdb.LazyString' is represented in GDB as an 'address' that points
to a region of memory, an 'encoding' that will be used to encode that
region of memory, and a 'length' to delimit the region of memory that
represents the string.  The difference between a 'gdb.LazyString' and a
string wrapped within a 'gdb.Value' is that a 'gdb.LazyString' will be
treated differently by GDB when printing.  A 'gdb.LazyString' is
retrieved and encoded during printing, while a 'gdb.Value' wrapping a
string is immediately retrieved and encoded on creation.

   A 'gdb.LazyString' object has the following functions:

 -- Function: LazyString.value ()
     Convert the 'gdb.LazyString' to a 'gdb.Value'.  This value will
     point to the string in memory, but will lose all the delayed
     retrieval, encoding and handling that GDB applies to a
     'gdb.LazyString'.

 -- Variable: LazyString.address
     This attribute holds the address of the string.  This attribute is
     not writable.

 -- Variable: LazyString.length
     This attribute holds the length of the string in characters.  If
     the length is -1, then the string will be fetched and encoded up to
     the first null of appropriate width.  This attribute is not
     writable.

 -- Variable: LazyString.encoding
     This attribute holds the encoding that will be applied to the
     string when the string is printed by GDB.  If the encoding is not
     set, or contains an empty string, then GDB will select the most
     appropriate encoding when the string is printed.  This attribute is
     not writable.

 -- Variable: LazyString.type
     This attribute holds the type that is represented by the lazy
     string's type.  For a lazy string this will always be a pointer
     type.  To resolve this to the lazy string's character type, use the
     type's 'target' method.  *Note Types In Python::.  This attribute
     is not writable.

23.2.2.31 Python representation of architectures
................................................

GDB uses architecture specific parameters and artifacts in a number of
its various computations.  An architecture is represented by an instance
of the 'gdb.Architecture' class.

   A 'gdb.Architecture' class has the following methods:

 -- Function: Architecture.name ()
     Return the name (string value) of the architecture.

 -- Function: Architecture.disassemble (START_PC [, END_PC [, COUNT]])
     Return a list of disassembled instructions starting from the memory
     address START_PC.  The optional arguments END_PC and COUNT
     determine the number of instructions in the returned list.  If both
     the optional arguments END_PC and COUNT are specified, then a list
     of at most COUNT disassembled instructions whose start address
     falls in the closed memory address interval from START_PC to END_PC
     are returned.  If END_PC is not specified, but COUNT is specified,
     then COUNT number of instructions starting from the address
     START_PC are returned.  If COUNT is not specified but END_PC is
     specified, then all instructions whose start address falls in the
     closed memory address interval from START_PC to END_PC are
     returned.  If neither END_PC nor COUNT are specified, then a single
     instruction at START_PC is returned.  For all of these cases, each
     element of the returned list is a Python 'dict' with the following
     string keys:

     'addr'
          The value corresponding to this key is a Python long integer
          capturing the memory address of the instruction.

     'asm'
          The value corresponding to this key is a string value which
          represents the instruction with assembly language mnemonics.
          The assembly language flavor used is the same as that
          specified by the current CLI variable 'disassembly-flavor'.
          *Note Machine Code::.

     'length'
          The value corresponding to this key is the length (integer
          value) of the instruction in bytes.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Python Auto-loading,  Next: Python modules,  Prev: Python API,  Up: Python

23.2.3 Python Auto-loading
--------------------------

When a new object file is read (for example, due to the 'file' command,
or because the inferior has loaded a shared library), GDB will look for
Python support scripts in several ways: 'OBJFILE-gdb.py' and
'.debug_gdb_scripts' section.  *Note Auto-loading extensions::.

   The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and scripts.

   Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled, and the list of auto-loaded
scripts can be printed.

'set auto-load python-scripts [on|off]'
     Enable or disable the auto-loading of Python scripts.

'show auto-load python-scripts'
     Show whether auto-loading of Python scripts is enabled or disabled.

'info auto-load python-scripts [REGEXP]'
     Print the list of all Python scripts that GDB auto-loaded.

     Also printed is the list of Python scripts that were mentioned in
     the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section and were not found (*note
     dotdebug_gdb_scripts section::).  This is useful because their
     names are not printed when GDB tries to load them and fails.  There
     may be many of them, and printing an error message for each one is
     problematic.

     If REGEXP is supplied only Python scripts with matching names are
     printed.

     Example:

          (gdb) info auto-load python-scripts
          Loaded Script
          Yes    py-section-script.py
                 full name: /tmp/py-section-script.py
          No     my-foo-pretty-printers.py

   When reading an auto-loaded file, GDB sets the "current objfile".
This is available via the 'gdb.current_objfile' function (*note Objfiles
In Python::).  This can be useful for registering objfile-specific
pretty-printers and frame-filters.

23.2.4 Python modules
---------------------

GDB comes with several modules to assist writing Python code.

* Menu:

* gdb.printing::       Building and registering pretty-printers.
* gdb.types::          Utilities for working with types.
* gdb.prompt::         Utilities for prompt value substitution.


File: gdb.info,  Node: gdb.printing,  Next: gdb.types,  Up: Python modules

23.2.4.1 gdb.printing
.....................

This module provides a collection of utilities for working with
pretty-printers.

'PrettyPrinter (NAME, SUBPRINTERS=None)'
     This class specifies the API that makes 'info pretty-printer',
     'enable pretty-printer' and 'disable pretty-printer' work.
     Pretty-printers should generally inherit from this class.

'SubPrettyPrinter (NAME)'
     For printers that handle multiple types, this class specifies the
     corresponding API for the subprinters.

'RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter (NAME)'
     Utility class for handling multiple printers, all recognized via
     regular expressions.  *Note Writing a Pretty-Printer::, for an
     example.

'FlagEnumerationPrinter (NAME)'
     A pretty-printer which handles printing of 'enum' values.  Unlike
     GDB's built-in 'enum' printing, this printer attempts to work
     properly when there is some overlap between the enumeration
     constants.  The argument NAME is the name of the printer and also
     the name of the 'enum' type to look up.

'register_pretty_printer (OBJ, PRINTER, REPLACE=False)'
     Register PRINTER with the pretty-printer list of OBJ.  If REPLACE
     is 'True' then any existing copy of the printer is replaced.
     Otherwise a 'RuntimeError' exception is raised if a printer with
     the same name already exists.

23.2.4.2 gdb.types
..................

This module provides a collection of utilities for working with
'gdb.Type' objects.

'get_basic_type (TYPE)'
     Return TYPE with const and volatile qualifiers stripped, and with
     typedefs and C++ references converted to the underlying type.

     C++ example:

          typedef const int const_int;
          const_int foo (3);
          const_int& foo_ref (foo);
          int main () { return 0; }

     Then in gdb:

          (gdb) start
          (gdb) python import gdb.types
          (gdb) python foo_ref = gdb.parse_and_eval("foo_ref")
          (gdb) python print gdb.types.get_basic_type(foo_ref.type)
          int

'has_field (TYPE, FIELD)'
     Return 'True' if TYPE, assumed to be a type with fields (e.g., a
     structure or union), has field FIELD.

'make_enum_dict (ENUM_TYPE)'
     Return a Python 'dictionary' type produced from ENUM_TYPE.

'deep_items (TYPE)'
     Returns a Python iterator similar to the standard
     'gdb.Type.iteritems' method, except that the iterator returned by
     'deep_items' will recursively traverse anonymous struct or union
     fields.  For example:

          struct A
          {
              int a;
              union {
                  int b0;
                  int b1;
              };
          };

     Then in GDB:
          (gdb) python import gdb.types
          (gdb) python struct_a = gdb.lookup_type("struct A")
          (gdb) python print struct_a.keys ()
          {['a', '']}
          (gdb) python print [k for k,v in gdb.types.deep_items(struct_a)]
          {['a', 'b0', 'b1']}

'get_type_recognizers ()'
     Return a list of the enabled type recognizers for the current
     context.  This is called by GDB during the type-printing process
     (*note Type Printing API::).

'apply_type_recognizers (recognizers, type_obj)'
     Apply the type recognizers, RECOGNIZERS, to the type object
     TYPE_OBJ.  If any recognizer returns a string, return that string.
     Otherwise, return 'None'.  This is called by GDB during the
     type-printing process (*note Type Printing API::).

'register_type_printer (locus, printer)'
     This is a convenience function to register a type printer PRINTER.
     The printer must implement the type printer protocol.  The LOCUS
     argument is either a 'gdb.Objfile', in which case the printer is
     registered with that objfile; a 'gdb.Progspace', in which case the
     printer is registered with that progspace; or 'None', in which case
     the printer is registered globally.

'TypePrinter'
     This is a base class that implements the type printer protocol.
     Type printers are encouraged, but not required, to derive from this
     class.  It defines a constructor:

      -- Method on TypePrinter: __init__ (self, name)
          Initialize the type printer with the given name.  The new
          printer starts in the enabled state.


File: gdb.info,  Node: gdb.prompt,  Prev: gdb.types,  Up: Python modules

23.2.4.3 gdb.prompt
...................

This module provides a method for prompt value-substitution.

'substitute_prompt (STRING)'
     Return STRING with escape sequences substituted by values.  Some
     escape sequences take arguments.  You can specify arguments inside
     "{}" immediately following the escape sequence.

     The escape sequences you can pass to this function are:

     '\\'
          Substitute a backslash.
     '\e'
          Substitute an ESC character.
     '\f'
          Substitute the selected frame; an argument names a frame
          parameter.
     '\n'
          Substitute a newline.
     '\p'
          Substitute a parameter's value; the argument names the
          parameter.
     '\r'
          Substitute a carriage return.
     '\t'
          Substitute the selected thread; an argument names a thread
          parameter.
     '\v'
          Substitute the version of GDB.
     '\w'
          Substitute the current working directory.
     '\['
          Begin a sequence of non-printing characters.  These sequences
          are typically used with the ESC character, and are not counted
          in the string length.  Example: "\[\e[0;34m\](gdb)\[\e[0m\]"
          will return a blue-colored "(gdb)" prompt where the length is
          five.
     '\]'
          End a sequence of non-printing characters.

     For example:

          substitute_prompt (``frame: \f,
                             print arguments: \p{print frame-arguments}'')

will return the string:

          "frame: main, print arguments: scalars"

23.3 Extending GDB using Guile
==============================

You can extend GDB using the Guile implementation of the Scheme
programming language (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).  This feature
is available only if GDB was configured using '--with-guile'.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Guile Introduction,  Next: Guile Commands,  Up: Guile

23.3.1 Guile Introduction
-------------------------

Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language and is the
GNU project's official extension language.

   Guile support in GDB follows the Python support in GDB reasonably
closely, so concepts there should carry over.  However, some things are
done differently where it makes sense.

   GDB requires Guile version 2.0 or greater.  Older versions are not
supported.

   Guile scripts used by GDB should be installed in
'DATA-DIRECTORY/guile', where DATA-DIRECTORY is the data directory as
determined at GDB startup (*note Data Files::).  This directory, known
as the "guile directory", is automatically added to the Guile Search
Path in order to allow the Guile interpreter to locate all scripts
installed at this location.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Guile Commands,  Next: Guile API,  Prev: Guile Introduction,  Up: Guile

23.3.2 Guile Commands
---------------------

GDB provides two commands for accessing the Guile interpreter:

'guile-repl'
'gr'
     The 'guile-repl' command can be used to start an interactive Guile
     prompt or "repl".  To return to GDB, type ',q' or the 'EOF'
     character (e.g., 'Ctrl-D' on an empty prompt).  These commands do
     not take any arguments.

'guile [SCHEME-EXPRESSION]'
'gu [SCHEME-EXPRESSION]'
     The 'guile' command can be used to evaluate a Scheme expression.

     If given an argument, GDB will pass the argument to the Guile
     interpreter for evaluation.

          (gdb) guile (display (+ 20 3)) (newline)
          23

     The result of the Scheme expression is displayed using normal Guile
     rules.

          (gdb) guile (+ 20 3)
          23

     If you do not provide an argument to 'guile', it will act as a
     multi-line command, like 'define'.  In this case, the Guile script
     is made up of subsequent command lines, given after the 'guile'
     command.  This command list is terminated using a line containing
     'end'.  For example:

          (gdb) guile
          >(display 23)
          >(newline)
          >end
          23

   It is also possible to execute a Guile script from the GDB
interpreter:

'source script-name'
     The script name must end with '.scm' and GDB must be configured to
     recognize the script language based on filename extension using the
     'script-extension' setting.  *Note Extending GDB: Extending GDB.

'guile (load "script-name")'
     This method uses the 'load' Guile function.  It takes a string
     argument that is the name of the script to load.  See the Guile
     documentation for a description of this function.  (*note
     (guile)Loading::).

----------------

You can get quick online help for GDB's Guile API by issuing the command
'help guile', or by issuing the command ',help' from an interactive
Guile session.  Furthermore, most Guile procedures provided by GDB have
doc strings which can be obtained with ',describe PROCEDURE-NAME' or ',d
PROCEDURE-NAME' from the Guile interactive prompt.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Basic Guile,  Next: Guile Configuration,  Up: Guile API

23.3.3.1 Basic Guile
....................

At startup, GDB overrides Guile's 'current-output-port' and
'current-error-port' to print using GDB's output-paging streams.  A
Guile program which outputs to one of these streams may have its output
interrupted by the user (*note Screen Size::).  In this situation, a
Guile 'signal' exception is thrown with value 'SIGINT'.

   Guile's history mechanism uses the same naming as GDB's, namely the
user of dollar-variables (e.g., $1, $2, etc.).  The results of
evaluations in Guile and in GDB are counted separately, '$1' in Guile is
not the same value as '$1' in GDB.

   GDB is not thread-safe.  If your Guile program uses multiple threads,
you must be careful to only call GDB-specific functions in the GDB
thread.

   Some care must be taken when writing Guile code to run in GDB.  Two
things are worth noting in particular:

   * GDB installs handlers for 'SIGCHLD' and 'SIGINT'.  Guile code must
     not override these, or even change the options using 'sigaction'.
     If your program changes the handling of these signals, GDB will
     most likely stop working correctly.  Note that it is unfortunately
     common for GUI toolkits to install a 'SIGCHLD' handler.

   * GDB takes care to mark its internal file descriptors as
     close-on-exec.  However, this cannot be done in a thread-safe way
     on all platforms.  Your Guile programs should be aware of this and
     should both create new file descriptors with the close-on-exec flag
     set and arrange to close unneeded file descriptors before starting
     a child process.

   GDB introduces a new Guile module, named 'gdb'.  All methods and
classes added by GDB are placed in this module.  GDB does not
automatically 'import' the 'gdb' module, scripts must do this
themselves.  There are various options for how to import a module, so
GDB leaves the choice of how the 'gdb' module is imported to the user.
To simplify interactive use, it is recommended to add one of the
following to your ~/.gdbinit.

     guile (use-modules (gdb))

     guile (use-modules ((gdb) #:renamer (symbol-prefix-proc 'gdb:)))

   Which one to choose depends on your preference.  The second one adds
'gdb:' as a prefix to all module functions and variables.

   The rest of this manual assumes the 'gdb' module has been imported
without any prefix.  See the Guile documentation for 'use-modules' for
more information (*note (guile)Using Guile Modules::).

   Example:

     (gdb) guile (value-type (make-value 1))
     ERROR: Unbound variable: value-type
     Error while executing Scheme code.
     (gdb) guile (use-modules (gdb))
     (gdb) guile (value-type (make-value 1))
     int
     (gdb)

   The '(gdb)' module provides these basic Guile functions.

 -- Scheme Procedure: execute command [#:from-tty boolean] [#:to-string
          boolean]
     Evaluate COMMAND, a string, as a GDB CLI command.  If a GDB
     exception happens while COMMAND runs, it is translated as described
     in *note Guile Exception Handling: Guile Exception Handling.

     FROM-TTY specifies whether GDB ought to consider this command as
     having originated from the user invoking it interactively.  It must
     be a boolean value.  If omitted, it defaults to '#f'.

     By default, any output produced by COMMAND is sent to GDB's
     standard output (and to the log output if logging is turned on).
     If the TO-STRING parameter is '#t', then output will be collected
     by 'execute' and returned as a string.  The default is '#f', in
     which case the return value is unspecified.  If TO-STRING is '#t',
     the GDB virtual terminal will be temporarily set to unlimited width
     and height, and its pagination will be disabled; *note Screen
     Size::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: history-ref number
     Return a value from GDB's value history (*note Value History::).
     The NUMBER argument indicates which history element to return.  If
     NUMBER is negative, then GDB will take its absolute value and count
     backward from the last element (i.e., the most recent element) to
     find the value to return.  If NUMBER is zero, then GDB will return
     the most recent element.  If the element specified by NUMBER
     doesn't exist in the value history, a 'gdb:error' exception will be
     raised.

     If no exception is raised, the return value is always an instance
     of '<gdb:value>' (*note Values From Inferior In Guile::).

     _Note:_ GDB's value history is independent of Guile's.  '$1' in
     GDB's value history contains the result of evaluating an expression
     from GDB's command line and '$1' from Guile's history contains the
     result of evaluating an expression from Guile's command line.

 -- Scheme Procedure: history-append! value
     Append VALUE, an instance of '<gdb:value>', to GDB's value history.
     Return its index in the history.

     Putting into history values returned by Guile extensions will allow
     the user convenient access to those values via CLI history
     facilities.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parse-and-eval expression
     Parse EXPRESSION as an expression in the current language, evaluate
     it, and return the result as a '<gdb:value>'.  The EXPRESSION must
     be a string.

     This function can be useful when implementing a new command (*note
     Commands In Guile::), as it provides a way to parse the command's
     arguments as an expression.  It is also is useful when computing
     values.  For example, it is the only way to get the value of a
     convenience variable (*note Convenience Vars::) as a '<gdb:value>'.

23.3.3.4 Guile Exception Handling
.................................

When executing the 'guile' command, Guile exceptions uncaught within the
Guile code are translated to calls to the GDB error-reporting mechanism.
If the command that called 'guile' does not handle the error, GDB will
terminate it and report the error according to the setting of the 'guile
print-stack' parameter.

   The 'guile print-stack' parameter has three settings:

'none'
     Nothing is printed.

'message'
     An error message is printed containing the Guile exception name,
     the associated value, and the Guile call stack backtrace at the
     point where the exception was raised.  Example:

          (gdb) guile (display foo)
          ERROR: In procedure memoize-variable-access!:
          ERROR: Unbound variable: foo
          Error while executing Scheme code.

'full'
     In addition to an error message a full backtrace is printed.

          (gdb) set guile print-stack full
          (gdb) guile (display foo)
          Guile Backtrace:
          In ice-9/boot-9.scm:
           157: 10 [catch #t #<catch-closure 2c76e20> ...]

             ?: 0 [memoize-variable-access! #<memoized foo> ...]

          ERROR: In procedure memoize-variable-access!:
          ERROR: Unbound variable: foo
          Error while executing Scheme code.

   GDB errors that happen in GDB commands invoked by Guile code are
converted to Guile exceptions.  The type of the Guile exception depends
on the error.

   Guile procedures provided by GDB can throw the standard Guile
exceptions like 'wrong-type-arg' and 'out-of-range'.

   User interrupt (via 'C-c' or by typing 'q' at a pagination prompt) is
translated to a Guile 'signal' exception with value 'SIGINT'.

   GDB Guile procedures can also throw these exceptions:

'gdb:error'
     This exception is a catch-all for errors generated from within GDB.

'gdb:invalid-object'
     This exception is thrown when accessing Guile objects that wrap
     underlying GDB objects have become invalid.  For example, a
     '<gdb:breakpoint>' object becomes invalid if the user deletes it
     from the command line.  The object still exists in Guile, but the
     object it represents is gone.  Further operations on this
     breakpoint will throw this exception.

'gdb:memory-error'
     This exception is thrown when an operation tried to access invalid
     memory in the inferior.

'gdb:pp-type-error'
     This exception is thrown when a Guile pretty-printer passes a bad
     object to GDB.

   The following exception-related procedures are provided by the
'(gdb)' module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-exception key args
     Return a '<gdb:exception>' object given by its KEY and ARGS, which
     are the standard Guile parameters of an exception.  See the Guile
     documentation for more information (*note (guile)Exceptions::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:exception>' object.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-key exception
     Return the ARGS field of a '<gdb:exception>' object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: exception-args exception
     Return the ARGS field of a '<gdb:exception>' object.

23.3.3.5 Values From Inferior In Guile
......................................

GDB provides values it obtains from the inferior program in an object of
type '<gdb:value>'.  GDB uses this object for its internal bookkeeping
of the inferior's values, and for fetching values when necessary.

   GDB does not memoize '<gdb:value>' objects.  'make-value' always
returns a fresh object.

     (gdb) guile (eq? (make-value 1) (make-value 1))
     $1 = #f
     (gdb) guile (equal? (make-value 1) (make-value 1))
     $1 = #t

   A '<gdb:value>' that represents a function can be executed via
inferior function call with 'value-call'.  Any arguments provided to the
call must match the function's prototype, and must be provided in the
order specified by that prototype.

   For example, 'some-val' is a '<gdb:value>' instance representing a
function that takes two integers as arguments.  To execute this
function, call it like so:

     (define result (value-call some-val 10 20))

   Any values returned from a function call are '<gdb:value>' objects.

   Note: Unlike Python scripting in GDB, inferior values that are simple
scalars cannot be used directly in Scheme expressions that are valid for
the value's data type.  For example, '(+ (parse-and-eval "int_variable")
2)' does not work.  And inferior values that are structures or instances
of some class cannot be accessed using any special syntax, instead
'value-field' must be used.

   The following value-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:value>' object.  Otherwise return
     '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-value value [#:type type]
     Many Scheme values can be converted directly to a '<gdb:value>'
     with this procedure.  If TYPE is specified, the result is a value
     of this type, and if VALUE can't be represented with this type an
     exception is thrown.  Otherwise the type of the result is
     determined from VALUE as described below.

     *Note Architectures In Guile::, for a list of the builtin types for
     an architecture.

     Here's how Scheme values are converted when TYPE argument to
     'make-value' is not specified:

     Scheme boolean
          A Scheme boolean is converted the boolean type for the current
          language.

     Scheme integer
          A Scheme integer is converted to the first of a C 'int',
          'unsigned int', 'long', 'unsigned long', 'long long' or
          'unsigned long long' type for the current architecture that
          can represent the value.

          If the Scheme integer cannot be represented as a target
          integer an 'out-of-range' exception is thrown.

     Scheme real
          A Scheme real is converted to the C 'double' type for the
          current architecture.

     Scheme string
          A Scheme string is converted to a string in the current target
          language using the current target encoding.  Characters that
          cannot be represented in the current target encoding are
          replaced with the corresponding escape sequence.  This is
          Guile's 'SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE' conversion
          strategy (*note (guile)Strings::).

          Passing TYPE is not supported in this case, if it is provided
          a 'wrong-type-arg' exception is thrown.

     '<gdb:lazy-string>'
          If VALUE is a '<gdb:lazy-string>' object (*note Lazy Strings
          In Guile::), then the 'lazy-string->value' procedure is
          called, and its result is used.

          Passing TYPE is not supported in this case, if it is provided
          a 'wrong-type-arg' exception is thrown.

     Scheme bytevector
          If VALUE is a Scheme bytevector and TYPE is provided, VALUE
          must be the same size, in bytes, of values of type TYPE, and
          the result is essentially created by using 'memcpy'.

          If VALUE is a Scheme bytevector and TYPE is not provided, the
          result is an array of type 'uint8' of the same length.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-optimized-out? value
     Return '#t' if the compiler optimized out VALUE, thus it is not
     available for fetching from the inferior.  Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-address value
     If VALUE is addressable, returns a '<gdb:value>' object
     representing the address.  Otherwise, '#f' is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-type value
     Return the type of VALUE as a '<gdb:type>' object (*note Types In
     Guile::).

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-dynamic-type value
     Return the dynamic type of VALUE.  This uses C++ run-time type
     information (RTTI) to determine the dynamic type of the value.  If
     the value is of class type, it will return the class in which the
     value is embedded, if any.  If the value is of pointer or reference
     to a class type, it will compute the dynamic type of the referenced
     object, and return a pointer or reference to that type,
     respectively.  In all other cases, it will return the value's
     static type.

     Note that this feature will only work when debugging a C++ program
     that includes RTTI for the object in question.  Otherwise, it will
     just return the static type of the value as in 'ptype foo'.  *Note
     ptype: Symbols.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-cast value type
     Return a new instance of '<gdb:value>' that is the result of
     casting VALUE to the type described by TYPE, which must be a
     '<gdb:type>' object.  If the cast cannot be performed for some
     reason, this method throws an exception.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-dynamic-cast value type
     Like 'value-cast', but works as if the C++ 'dynamic_cast' operator
     were used.  Consult a C++ reference for details.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-reinterpret-cast value type
     Like 'value-cast', but works as if the C++ 'reinterpret_cast'
     operator were used.  Consult a C++ reference for details.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-dereference value
     For pointer data types, this method returns a new '<gdb:value>'
     object whose contents is the object pointed to by VALUE.  For
     example, if 'foo' is a C pointer to an 'int', declared in your C
     program as

          int *foo;

     then you can use the corresponding '<gdb:value>' to access what
     'foo' points to like this:

          (define bar (value-dereference foo))

     The result 'bar' will be a '<gdb:value>' object holding the value
     pointed to by 'foo'.

     A similar function 'value-referenced-value' exists which also
     returns '<gdb:value>' objects corresonding to the values pointed to
     by pointer values (and additionally, values referenced by reference
     values).  However, the behavior of 'value-dereference' differs from
     'value-referenced-value' by the fact that the behavior of
     'value-dereference' is identical to applying the C unary operator
     '*' on a given value.  For example, consider a reference to a
     pointer 'ptrref', declared in your C++ program as

          typedef int *intptr;
          ...
          int val = 10;
          intptr ptr = &val;
          intptr &ptrref = ptr;

     Though 'ptrref' is a reference value, one can apply the method
     'value-dereference' to the '<gdb:value>' object corresponding to it
     and obtain a '<gdb:value>' which is identical to that corresponding
     to 'val'.  However, if you apply the method
     'value-referenced-value', the result would be a '<gdb:value>'
     object identical to that corresponding to 'ptr'.

          (define scm-ptrref (parse-and-eval "ptrref"))
          (define scm-val (value-dereference scm-ptrref))
          (define scm-ptr (value-referenced-value scm-ptrref))

     The '<gdb:value>' object 'scm-val' is identical to that
     corresponding to 'val', and 'scm-ptr' is identical to that
     corresponding to 'ptr'.  In general, 'value-dereference' can be
     applied whenever the C unary operator '*' can be applied to the
     corresponding C value.  For those cases where applying both
     'value-dereference' and 'value-referenced-value' is allowed, the
     results obtained need not be identical (as we have seen in the
     above example).  The results are however identical when applied on
     '<gdb:value>' objects corresponding to pointers ('<gdb:value>'
     objects with type code 'TYPE_CODE_PTR') in a C/C++ program.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-referenced-value value
     For pointer or reference data types, this method returns a new
     '<gdb:value>' object corresponding to the value referenced by the
     pointer/reference value.  For pointer data types,
     'value-dereference' and 'value-referenced-value' produce identical
     results.  The difference between these methods is that
     'value-dereference' cannot get the values referenced by reference
     values.  For example, consider a reference to an 'int', declared in
     your C++ program as

          int val = 10;
          int &ref = val;

     then applying 'value-dereference' to the '<gdb:value>' object
     corresponding to 'ref' will result in an error, while applying
     'value-referenced-value' will result in a '<gdb:value>' object
     identical to that corresponding to 'val'.

          (define scm-ref (parse-and-eval "ref"))
          (define err-ref (value-dereference scm-ref))      ;; error
          (define scm-val (value-referenced-value scm-ref)) ;; ok

     The '<gdb:value>' object 'scm-val' is identical to that
     corresponding to 'val'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-field value field-name
     Return field FIELD-NAME from '<gdb:value>' object VALUE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-subscript value index
     Return the value of array VALUE at index INDEX.  The VALUE argument
     must be a subscriptable '<gdb:value>' object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-call value arg-list
     Perform an inferior function call, taking VALUE as a pointer to the
     function to call.  Each element of list ARG-LIST must be a
     <gdb:value> object or an object that can be converted to a value.
     The result is the value returned by the function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value->bool value
     Return the Scheme boolean representing '<gdb:value>' VALUE.  The
     value must be "integer like".  Pointers are ok.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value->integer
     Return the Scheme integer representing '<gdb:value>' VALUE.  The
     value must be "integer like".  Pointers are ok.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value->real
     Return the Scheme real number representing '<gdb:value>' VALUE.
     The value must be a number.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value->bytevector
     Return a Scheme bytevector with the raw contents of '<gdb:value>'
     VALUE.  No transformation, endian or otherwise, is performed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value->string value [#:encoding encoding]
          [#:errors errors] [#:length length]
     If VALUE> represents a string, then this method converts the
     contents to a Guile string.  Otherwise, this method will throw an
     exception.

     Values are interpreted as strings according to the rules of the
     current language.  If the optional length argument is given, the
     string will be converted to that length, and will include any
     embedded zeroes that the string may contain.  Otherwise, for
     languages where the string is zero-terminated, the entire string
     will be converted.

     For example, in C-like languages, a value is a string if it is a
     pointer to or an array of characters or ints of type 'wchar_t',
     'char16_t', or 'char32_t'.

     If the optional ENCODING argument is given, it must be a string
     naming the encoding of the string in the '<gdb:value>', such as
     '"ascii"', '"iso-8859-6"' or '"utf-8"'.  It accepts the same
     encodings as the corresponding argument to Guile's
     'scm_from_stringn' function, and the Guile codec machinery will be
     used to convert the string.  If ENCODING is not given, or if
     ENCODING is the empty string, then either the 'target-charset'
     (*note Character Sets::) will be used, or a language-specific
     encoding will be used, if the current language is able to supply
     one.

     The optional ERRORS argument is one of '#f', 'error' or
     'substitute'.  'error' and 'substitute' must be symbols.  If ERRORS
     is not specified, or if its value is '#f', then the default
     conversion strategy is used, which is set with the Scheme function
     'set-port-conversion-strategy!'.  If the value is ''error' then an
     exception is thrown if there is any conversion error.  If the value
     is ''substitute' then any conversion error is replaced with
     question marks.  *Note (guile)Strings::.

     If the optional LENGTH argument is given, the string will be
     fetched and converted to the given length.  The length must be a
     Scheme integer and not a '<gdb:value>' integer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value->lazy-string value [#:encoding encoding]
          [#:length length]
     If this '<gdb:value>' represents a string, then this method
     converts VALUE to a '<gdb:lazy-string' (*note Lazy Strings In
     Guile::).  Otherwise, this method will throw an exception.

     If the optional ENCODING argument is given, it must be a string
     naming the encoding of the '<gdb:lazy-string'.  Some examples are:
     '"ascii"', '"iso-8859-6"' or '"utf-8"'.  If the ENCODING argument
     is an encoding that GDB does not recognize, GDB will raise an
     error.

     When a lazy string is printed, the GDB encoding machinery is used
     to convert the string during printing.  If the optional ENCODING
     argument is not provided, or is an empty string, GDB will
     automatically select the encoding most suitable for the string
     type.  For further information on encoding in GDB please see *note
     Character Sets::.

     If the optional LENGTH argument is given, the string will be
     fetched and encoded to the length of characters specified.  If the
     LENGTH argument is not provided, the string will be fetched and
     encoded until a null of appropriate width is found.  The length
     must be a Scheme integer and not a '<gdb:value>' integer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-lazy? value
     Return '#t' if VALUE has not yet been fetched from the inferior.
     Otherwise return '#f'.  GDB does not fetch values until necessary,
     for efficiency.  For example:

          (define myval (parse-and-eval "somevar"))

     The value of 'somevar' is not fetched at this time.  It will be
     fetched when the value is needed, or when the 'fetch-lazy'
     procedure is invoked.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-lazy-value type address
     Return a '<gdb:value>' that will be lazily fetched from the target.
     The object of type '<gdb:type>' whose value to fetch is specified
     by its TYPE and its target memory ADDRESS, which is a Scheme
     integer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-fetch-lazy! value
     If VALUE is a lazy value ('(value-lazy? value)' is '#t'), then the
     value is fetched from the inferior.  Any errors that occur in the
     process will produce a Guile exception.

     If VALUE is not a lazy value, this method has no effect.

     The result of this function is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-print value
     Return the string representation (print form) of '<gdb:value>'
     VALUE.

23.3.3.6 Arithmetic In Guile
............................

The '(gdb)' module provides several functions for performing arithmetic
on '<gdb:value>' objects.  The arithmetic is performed as if it were
done by the target, and therefore has target semantics which are not
necessarily those of Scheme.  For example operations work with a fixed
precision, not the arbitrary precision of Scheme.

   Wherever a function takes an integer or pointer as an operand, GDB
will convert appropriate Scheme values to perform the operation.

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-add a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-sub a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-mul a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-div a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-rem a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-mod a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-pow a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-not a

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-neg a

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-pos a

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-abs a

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-lsh a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-rsh a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-min a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-max a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-lognot a

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-logand a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-logior a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value-logxor a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value=? a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value<? a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value<=? a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value>? a b

 -- Scheme Procedure: value>=? a b

   Scheme does not provide a 'not-equal' function, and thus Guile
support in GDB does not either.

23.3.3.7 Types In Guile
.......................

GDB represents types from the inferior in objects of type '<gdb:type>'.

   The following type-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:type>'.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookup-type name [#:block block]
     This function looks up a type by its NAME, which must be a string.

     If BLOCK is given, it is an object of type '<gdb:block>', and NAME
     is looked up in that scope.  Otherwise, it is searched for
     globally.

     Ordinarily, this function will return an instance of '<gdb:type>'.
     If the named type cannot be found, it will throw an exception.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-code type
     Return the type code of TYPE.  The type code will be one of the
     'TYPE_CODE_' constants defined below.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-tag type
     Return the tag name of TYPE.  The tag name is the name after
     'struct', 'union', or 'enum' in C and C++; not all languages have
     this concept.  If this type has no tag name, then '#f' is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-name type
     Return the name of TYPE.  If this type has no name, then '#f' is
     returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-print-name type
     Return the print name of TYPE.  This returns something even for
     anonymous types.  For example, for an anonymous C struct '"struct
     {...}"' is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-sizeof type
     Return the size of this type, in target 'char' units.  Usually, a
     target's 'char' type will be an 8-bit byte.  However, on some
     unusual platforms, this type may have a different size.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-strip-typedefs type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' that represents the real type of TYPE,
     after removing all layers of typedefs.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-array type n1 [n2]
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents an array of this
     type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
     the array; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments
     are given, the first argument is the lower bound of the array, and
     the second argument is the upper bound of the array.  An array's
     length must not be negative, but the bounds can be.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-vector type n1 [n2]
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents a vector of this
     type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
     the vector; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments
     are given, the first argument is the lower bound of the vector, and
     the second argument is the upper bound of the vector.  A vector's
     length must not be negative, but the bounds can be.

     The difference between an 'array' and a 'vector' is that arrays
     behave like in C: when used in expressions they decay to a pointer
     to the first element whereas vectors are treated as first class
     values.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-pointer type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents a pointer to
     TYPE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-range type
     Return a list of two elements: the low bound and high bound of
     TYPE.  If TYPE does not have a range, an exception is thrown.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-reference type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents a reference to
     TYPE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-target type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents the target type
     of TYPE.

     For a pointer type, the target type is the type of the pointed-to
     object.  For an array type (meaning C-like arrays), the target type
     is the type of the elements of the array.  For a function or method
     type, the target type is the type of the return value.  For a
     complex type, the target type is the type of the elements.  For a
     typedef, the target type is the aliased type.

     If the type does not have a target, this method will throw an
     exception.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-const type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents a
     'const'-qualified variant of TYPE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-volatile type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents a
     'volatile'-qualified variant of TYPE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-unqualified type
     Return a new '<gdb:type>' object which represents an unqualified
     variant of TYPE.  That is, the result is neither 'const' nor
     'volatile'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-num-fields
     Return the number of fields of '<gdb:type>' TYPE.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-fields type
     Return the fields of TYPE as a list.  For structure and union
     types, 'fields' has the usual meaning.  Range types have two
     fields, the minimum and maximum values.  Enum types have one field
     per enum constant.  Function and method types have one field per
     parameter.  The base types of C++ classes are also represented as
     fields.  If the type has no fields, or does not fit into one of
     these categories, an empty list will be returned.  *Note Fields of
     a type in Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-field-iterator type
     Return the fields of TYPE as a <gdb:iterator> object.  *Note
     Iterators In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-field type field-name
     Return field named FIELD-NAME in TYPE.  The result is an object of
     type '<gdb:field>'.  *Note Fields of a type in Guile::.  If the
     type does not have fields, or FIELD-NAME is not a field of TYPE, an
     exception is thrown.

     For example, if 'some-type' is a '<gdb:type>' instance holding a
     structure type, you can access its 'foo' field with:

          (define bar (type-field some-type "foo"))

     'bar' will be a '<gdb:field>' object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: type-has-field? type name
     Return '#t' if '<gdb:type>' TYPE has field named NAME.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

   Each type has a code, which indicates what category this type falls
into.  The available type categories are represented by constants
defined in the '(gdb)' module:

'TYPE_CODE_PTR'
     The type is a pointer.

'TYPE_CODE_ARRAY'
     The type is an array.

'TYPE_CODE_STRUCT'
     The type is a structure.

'TYPE_CODE_UNION'
     The type is a union.

'TYPE_CODE_ENUM'
     The type is an enum.

'TYPE_CODE_FLAGS'
     A bit flags type, used for things such as status registers.

'TYPE_CODE_FUNC'
     The type is a function.

'TYPE_CODE_INT'
     The type is an integer type.

'TYPE_CODE_FLT'
     A floating point type.

'TYPE_CODE_VOID'
     The special type 'void'.

'TYPE_CODE_SET'
     A Pascal set type.

'TYPE_CODE_RANGE'
     A range type, that is, an integer type with bounds.

'TYPE_CODE_STRING'
     A string type.  Note that this is only used for certain languages
     with language-defined string types; C strings are not represented
     this way.

'TYPE_CODE_BITSTRING'
     A string of bits.  It is deprecated.

'TYPE_CODE_ERROR'
     An unknown or erroneous type.

'TYPE_CODE_METHOD'
     A method type, as found in C++ or Java.

'TYPE_CODE_METHODPTR'
     A pointer-to-member-function.

'TYPE_CODE_MEMBERPTR'
     A pointer-to-member.

'TYPE_CODE_REF'
     A reference type.

'TYPE_CODE_CHAR'
     A character type.

'TYPE_CODE_BOOL'
     A boolean type.

'TYPE_CODE_COMPLEX'
     A complex float type.

'TYPE_CODE_TYPEDEF'
     A typedef to some other type.

'TYPE_CODE_NAMESPACE'
     A C++ namespace.

'TYPE_CODE_DECFLOAT'
     A decimal floating point type.

'TYPE_CODE_INTERNAL_FUNCTION'
     A function internal to GDB.  This is the type used to represent
     convenience functions (*note Convenience Funs::).

   Further support for types is provided in the '(gdb types)' Guile
module (*note Guile Types Module::).

   Each field is represented as an object of type '<gdb:field>'.

   The following field-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: field? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:field>'.
     Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-name field
     Return the name of the field, or '#f' for anonymous fields.

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-type field
     Return the type of the field.  This is usually an instance of
     '<gdb:type>', but it can be '#f' in some situations.

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-enumval field
     Return the enum value represented by '<gdb:field>' FIELD.

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-bitpos field
     Return the bit position of '<gdb:field>' FIELD.  This attribute is
     not available for 'static' fields (as in C++ or Java).

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-bitsize field
     If the field is packed, or is a bitfield, return the size of
     '<gdb:field>' FIELD in bits.  Otherwise, zero is returned; in which
     case the field's size is given by its type.

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-artificial? field
     Return '#t' if the field is artificial, usually meaning that it was
     provided by the compiler and not the user.  Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: field-base-class? field
     Return '#t' if the field represents a base class of a C++
     structure.  Otherwise return '#f'.

23.3.3.8 Guile Pretty Printing API
..................................

An example output is provided (*note Pretty Printing::).

   A pretty-printer is represented by an object of type
<gdb:pretty-printer>.  Pretty-printer objects are created with
'make-pretty-printer'.

   The following pretty-printer-related procedures are provided by the
'(gdb)' module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-pretty-printer name lookup-function
     Return a '<gdb:pretty-printer>' object named NAME.

     LOOKUP-FUNCTION is a function of one parameter: the value to be
     printed.  If the value is handled by this pretty-printer, then
     LOOKUP-FUNCTION returns an object of type
     <gdb:pretty-printer-worker> to perform the actual pretty-printing.
     Otherwise LOOKUP-FUNCTION returns '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pretty-printer? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:pretty-printer>' object.
     Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pretty-printer-enabled? pretty-printer
     Return '#t' if PRETTY-PRINTER is enabled.  Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-pretty-printer-enabled! pretty-printer flag
     Set the enabled flag of PRETTY-PRINTER to FLAG.  The value returned
     is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: pretty-printers
     Return the list of global pretty-printers.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-pretty-printers! pretty-printers
     Set the list of global pretty-printers to PRETTY-PRINTERS.  The
     value returned is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-pretty-printer-worker display-hint to-string
          children
     Return an object of type '<gdb:pretty-printer-worker>'.

     This function takes three parameters:

     'display-hint'
          DISPLAY-HINT provides a hint to GDB or GDB front end via MI to
          change the formatting of the value being printed.  The value
          must be a string or '#f' (meaning there is no hint).  Several
          values for DISPLAY-HINT are predefined by GDB:

          'array'
               Indicate that the object being printed is "array-like".
               The CLI uses this to respect parameters such as 'set
               print elements' and 'set print array'.

          'map'
               Indicate that the object being printed is "map-like", and
               that the children of this value can be assumed to
               alternate between keys and values.

          'string'
               Indicate that the object being printed is "string-like".
               If the printer's 'to-string' function returns a Guile
               string of some kind, then GDB will call its internal
               language-specific string-printing function to format the
               string.  For the CLI this means adding quotation marks,
               possibly escaping some characters, respecting 'set print
               elements', and the like.

     'to-string'
          TO-STRING is either a function of one parameter, the
          '<gdb:pretty-printer-worker>' object, or '#f'.

          When printing from the CLI, if the 'to-string' method exists,
          then GDB will prepend its result to the values returned by
          'children'.  Exactly how this formatting is done is dependent
          on the display hint, and may change as more hints are added.
          Also, depending on the print settings (*note Print
          Settings::), the CLI may print just the result of 'to-string'
          in a stack trace, omitting the result of 'children'.

          If this method returns a string, it is printed verbatim.

          Otherwise, if this method returns an instance of
          '<gdb:value>', then GDB prints this value.  This may result in
          a call to another pretty-printer.

          If instead the method returns a Guile value which is
          convertible to a '<gdb:value>', then GDB performs the
          conversion and prints the resulting value.  Again, this may
          result in a call to another pretty-printer.  Guile scalars
          (integers, floats, and booleans) and strings are convertible
          to '<gdb:value>'; other types are not.

          Finally, if this method returns '#f' then no further
          operations are peformed in this method and nothing is printed.

          If the result is not one of these types, an exception is
          raised.

          TO-STRING may also be '#f' in which case it is left to
          CHILDREN to print the value.

     'children'
          CHILDREN is either a function of one parameter, the
          '<gdb:pretty-printer-worker>' object, or '#f'.

          GDB will call this function on a pretty-printer to compute the
          children of the pretty-printer's value.

          This function must return a <gdb:iterator> object.  Each item
          returned by the iterator must be a tuple holding two elements.
          The first element is the "name" of the child; the second
          element is the child's value.  The value can be any Guile
          object which is convertible to a GDB value.

          If CHILDREN is '#f', GDB will act as though the value has no
          children.

   GDB provides a function which can be used to look up the default
pretty-printer for a '<gdb:value>':

 -- Scheme Procedure: default-visualizer value
     This function takes a '<gdb:value>' object as an argument.  If a
     pretty-printer for this value exists, then it is returned.  If no
     such printer exists, then this returns '#f'.

23.3.3.9 Selecting Guile Pretty-Printers
........................................

There are three sets of pretty-printers that GDB searches:

   * Per-objfile list of pretty-printers (*note Objfiles In Guile::).
   * Per-progspace list of pretty-printers (*note Progspaces In
     Guile::).
   * The global list of pretty-printers (*note Guile Pretty Printing
     API::).  These printers are available when debugging any inferior.

   Pretty-printer lookup is done by passing the value to be printed to
the lookup function of each enabled object in turn.  Lookup stops when a
lookup function returns a non-'#f' value or when the list is exhausted.
Lookup functions must return either a '<gdb:pretty-printer-worker>'
object or '#f'.  Otherwise an exception is thrown.

   GDB first checks the result of 'objfile-pretty-printers' of each
'<gdb:objfile>' in the current program space and iteratively calls each
enabled lookup function in the list for that '<gdb:objfile>' until a
non-'#f' object is returned.  If no pretty-printer is found in the
objfile lists, GDB then searches the result of
'progspace-pretty-printers' of the current program space, calling each
enabled function until a non-'#f' object is returned.  After these lists
have been exhausted, it tries the global pretty-printers list, obtained
with 'pretty-printers', again calling each enabled function until a
non-'#f' object is returned.

   The order in which the objfiles are searched is not specified.  For a
given list, functions are always invoked from the head of the list, and
iterated over sequentially until the end of the list, or a
'<gdb:pretty-printer-worker>' object is returned.

   For various reasons a pretty-printer may not work.  For example, the
underlying data structure may have changed and the pretty-printer is out
of date.

   The consequences of a broken pretty-printer are severe enough that
GDB provides support for enabling and disabling individual printers.
For example, if 'print frame-arguments' is on, a backtrace can become
highly illegible if any argument is printed with a broken printer.

   Pretty-printers are enabled and disabled from Scheme by calling
'set-pretty-printer-enabled!'.  *Note Guile Pretty Printing API::.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Writing a Guile Pretty-Printer,  Next: Commands In Guile,  Prev: Selecting Guile Pretty-Printers,  Up: Guile API

23.3.3.10 Writing a Guile Pretty-Printer
........................................

A pretty-printer consists of two basic parts: a lookup function to
determine if the type is supported, and the printer itself.

   Here is an example showing how a 'std::string' printer might be
written.  *Note Guile Pretty Printing API::, for details.

     (define (make-my-string-printer value)
       "Print a my::string string"
       (make-pretty-printer-worker
        "string"
        (lambda (printer)
          (value-field value "_data"))
        #f))

   And here is an example showing how a lookup function for the printer
example above might be written.

     (define (str-lookup-function pretty-printer value)
       (let ((tag (type-tag (value-type value))))
         (and tag
              (string-prefix? "std::string<" tag)
              (make-my-string-printer value))))

   Then to register this printer in the global printer list:

     (append-pretty-printer!
      (make-pretty-printer "my-string" str-lookup-function))

   The example lookup function extracts the value's type, and attempts
to match it to a type that it can pretty-print.  If it is a type the
printer can pretty-print, it will return a <gdb:pretty-printer-worker>
object.  If not, it returns '#f'.

   We recommend that you put your core pretty-printers into a Guile
package.  If your pretty-printers are for use with a library, we further
recommend embedding a version number into the package name.  This
practice will enable GDB to load multiple versions of your
pretty-printers at the same time, because they will have different
names.

   You should write auto-loaded code (*note Guile Auto-loading::) such
that it can be evaluated multiple times without changing its meaning.
An ideal auto-load file will consist solely of 'import's of your printer
modules, followed by a call to a register pretty-printers with the
current objfile.

   Taken as a whole, this approach will scale nicely to multiple
inferiors, each potentially using a different library version.
Embedding a version number in the Guile package name will ensure that
GDB is able to load both sets of printers simultaneously.  Then, because
the search for pretty-printers is done by objfile, and because your
auto-loaded code took care to register your library's printers with a
specific objfile, GDB will find the correct printers for the specific
version of the library used by each inferior.

   To continue the 'my::string' example, this code might appear in
'(my-project my-library v1)':

     (use-modules (gdb))
     (define (register-printers objfile)
       (append-objfile-pretty-printer!
        (make-pretty-printer "my-string" str-lookup-function)))

And then the corresponding contents of the auto-load file would be:

     (use-modules (gdb) (my-project my-library v1))
     (register-printers (current-objfile))

   The previous example illustrates a basic pretty-printer.  There are a
few things that can be improved on.  The printer only handles one type,
whereas a library typically has several types.  One could install a
lookup function for each desired type in the library, but one could also
have a single lookup function recognize several types.  The latter is
the conventional way this is handled.  If a pretty-printer can handle
multiple data types, then its "subprinters" are the printers for the
individual data types.

   The '(gdb printing)' module provides a formal way of solving this
problem (*note Guile Printing Module::).  Here is another example that
handles multiple types.

   These are the types we are going to pretty-print:

     struct foo { int a, b; };
     struct bar { struct foo x, y; };

   Here are the printers:

     (define (make-foo-printer value)
       "Print a foo object"
       (make-pretty-printer-worker
        "foo"
        (lambda (printer)
          (format #f "a=<~a> b=<~a>"
                  (value-field value "a") (value-field value "a")))
        #f))

     (define (make-bar-printer value)
       "Print a bar object"
       (make-pretty-printer-worker
        "foo"
        (lambda (printer)
          (format #f "x=<~a> y=<~a>"
                  (value-field value "x") (value-field value "y")))
        #f))

   This example doesn't need a lookup function, that is handled by the
'(gdb printing)' module.  Instead a function is provided to build up the
object that handles the lookup.

     (use-modules (gdb printing))

     (define (build-pretty-printer)
       (let ((pp (make-pretty-printer-collection "my-library")))
         (pp-collection-add-tag-printer "foo" make-foo-printer)
         (pp-collection-add-tag-printer "bar" make-bar-printer)
         pp))

   And here is the autoload support:

     (use-modules (gdb) (my-library))
     (append-objfile-pretty-printer! (current-objfile) (build-pretty-printer))

   Finally, when this printer is loaded into GDB, here is the
corresponding output of 'info pretty-printer':

     (gdb) info pretty-printer
     my_library.so:
       my-library
         foo
         bar

is created with the 'make-command' Guile function, and added to GDB with
the 'register-command!' Guile function.  This two-step approach is taken
to separate out the side-effect of adding the command to GDB from
'make-command'.

   There is no support for multi-line commands, that is commands that
consist of multiple lines and are terminated with 'end'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: (make-command name [#:invoke invoke]
          [#:command-class command-class] [#:completer-class completer]
          [#:prefix? prefix] [#:doc doc-string])

     The argument NAME is the name of the command.  If NAME consists of
     multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
     commands.  In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not
     exist, an exception is raised.

     The result is the '<gdb:command>' object representing the command.
     The command is not usable until it has been registered with GDB
     with 'register-command!'.

     The rest of the arguments are optional.

     The argument INVOKE is a procedure of three arguments: SELF, ARGS
     and FROM-TTY.  The argument SELF is the '<gdb:command>' object
     representing the command.  The argument ARGS is a string
     representing the arguments passed to the command, after leading and
     trailing whitespace has been stripped.  The argument FROM-TTY is a
     boolean flag and specifies whether the command should consider
     itself to have been originated from the user invoking it
     interactively.  If this function throws an exception, it is turned
     into a GDB 'error' call.  Otherwise, the return value is ignored.

     The argument COMMAND-CLASS is one of the 'COMMAND_' constants
     defined below.  This argument tells GDB how to categorize the new
     command in the help system.  The default is 'COMMAND_NONE'.

     The argument COMPLETER is either '#f', one of the 'COMPLETE_'
     constants defined below, or a procedure, also defined below.  This
     argument tells GDB how to perform completion for this command.  If
     not provided or if the value is '#f', then no completion is
     performed on the command.

     The argument PREFIX is a boolean flag indicating whether the new
     command is a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be
     registered.

     The argument DOC-STRING is help text for the new command.  If no
     documentation string is provided, the default value "This command
     is not documented."  is used.

 -- Scheme Procedure: register-command! command
     Add COMMAND, a '<gdb:command>' object, to GDB's list of commands.
     It is an error to register a command more than once.  The result is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: command? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:command>' object.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: dont-repeat
     By default, a GDB command is repeated when the user enters a blank
     line at the command prompt.  A command can suppress this behavior
     by invoking the 'dont-repeat' function.  This is similar to the
     user command 'dont-repeat', see *note dont-repeat: Define.

 -- Scheme Procedure: string->argv string
     Convert a string to a list of strings split up according to GDB's
     argv parsing rules.  It is recommended to use this for consistency.
     Arguments are separated by spaces and may be quoted.  Example:

          scheme@(guile-user)> (string->argv "1 2\\ \\\"3 '4 \"5' \"6 '7\"")
          $1 = ("1" "2 \"3" "4 \"5" "6 '7")

 -- Scheme Procedure: throw-user-error message . args
     Throw a 'gdb:user-error' exception.  The argument MESSAGE is the
     error message as a format string, like the FMT argument to the
     'format' Scheme function.  *Note (guile)Formatted Output::.  The
     argument ARGS is a list of the optional arguments of MESSAGE.

     This is used when the command detects a user error of some kind,
     say a bad command argument.

          (gdb) guile (use-modules (gdb))
          (gdb) guile
          (register-command! (make-command "test-user-error"
            #:command-class COMMAND_OBSCURE
            #:invoke (lambda (self arg from-tty)
              (throw-user-error "Bad argument ~a" arg))))
          end
          (gdb) test-user-error ugh
          ERROR: Bad argument ugh

 -- completer: self text word
     If the COMPLETER option to 'make-command' is a procedure, it takes
     three arguments: SELF which is the '<gdb:command>' object, and TEXT
     and WORD which are both strings.  The argument TEXT holds the
     complete command line up to the cursor's location.  The argument
     WORD holds the last word of the command line; this is computed
     using a word-breaking heuristic.

     All forms of completion are handled by this function, that is, the
     <TAB> and <M-?> key bindings (*note Completion::), and the
     'complete' command (*note complete: Help.).

     This procedure can return several kinds of values:

        * If the return value is a list, the contents of the list are
          used as the completions.  It is up to COMPLETER to ensure that
          the contents actually do complete the word.  An empty list is
          allowed, it means that there were no completions available.
          Only string elements of the list are used; other elements in
          the list are ignored.

        * If the return value is a '<gdb:iterator>' object, it is
          iterated over to obtain the completions.  It is up to
          'completer-procedure' to ensure that the results actually do
          complete the word.  Only string elements of the result are
          used; other elements in the sequence are ignored.

        * All other results are treated as though there were no
          available completions.

   When a new command is registered, it will have been declared as a
member of some general class of commands.  This is used to classify
top-level commands in the on-line help system; note that prefix commands
are not listed under their own category but rather that of their
top-level command.  The available classifications are represented by
constants defined in the 'gdb' module:

'COMMAND_NONE'
     The command does not belong to any particular class.  A command in
     this category will not be displayed in any of the help categories.
     This is the default.

'COMMAND_RUNNING'
     The command is related to running the inferior.  For example,
     'start', 'step', and 'continue' are in this category.  Type 'help
     running' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'COMMAND_DATA'
     The command is related to data or variables.  For example, 'call',
     'find', and 'print' are in this category.  Type 'help data' at the
     GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'COMMAND_STACK'
     The command has to do with manipulation of the stack.  For example,
     'backtrace', 'frame', and 'return' are in this category.  Type
     'help stack' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'COMMAND_FILES'
     This class is used for file-related commands.  For example, 'file',
     'list' and 'section' are in this category.  Type 'help files' at
     the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'COMMAND_SUPPORT'
     This should be used for "support facilities", generally meaning
     things that are useful to the user when interacting with GDB, but
     not related to the state of the inferior.  For example, 'help',
     'make', and 'shell' are in this category.  Type 'help support' at
     the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this category.

'COMMAND_STATUS'
     The command is an 'info'-related command, that is, related to the
     state of GDB itself.  For example, 'info', 'macro', and 'show' are
     in this category.  Type 'help status' at the GDB prompt to see a
     list of commands in this category.

'COMMAND_BREAKPOINTS'
     The command has to do with breakpoints.  For example, 'break',
     'clear', and 'delete' are in this category.  Type 'help
     breakpoints' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'COMMAND_TRACEPOINTS'
     The command has to do with tracepoints.  For example, 'trace',
     'actions', and 'tfind' are in this category.  Type 'help
     tracepoints' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

'COMMAND_USER'
     The command is a general purpose command for the user, and
     typically does not fit in one of the other categories.  Type 'help
     user-defined' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category, as well as the list of gdb macros (*note Sequences::).

'COMMAND_OBSCURE'
     The command is only used in unusual circumstances, or is not of
     general interest to users.  For example, 'checkpoint', 'fork', and
     'stop' are in this category.  Type 'help obscure' at the GDB prompt
     to see a list of commands in this category.

'COMMAND_MAINTENANCE'
     The command is only useful to GDB maintainers.  The 'maintenance'
     and 'flushregs' commands are in this category.  Type 'help
     internals' at the GDB prompt to see a list of commands in this
     category.

   A new command can use a predefined completion function, either by
specifying it via an argument at initialization, or by returning it from
the 'completer' procedure.  These predefined completion constants are
all defined in the 'gdb' module:

'COMPLETE_NONE'
     This constant means that no completion should be done.

'COMPLETE_FILENAME'
     This constant means that filename completion should be performed.

'COMPLETE_LOCATION'
     This constant means that location completion should be done.  *Note
     Specify Location::.

'COMPLETE_COMMAND'
     This constant means that completion should examine GDB command
     names.

'COMPLETE_SYMBOL'
     This constant means that completion should be done using symbol
     names as the source.

'COMPLETE_EXPRESSION'
     This constant means that completion should be done on expressions.
     Often this means completing on symbol names, but some language
     parsers also have support for completing on field names.

   The following code snippet shows how a trivial CLI command can be
implemented in Guile:

     (gdb) guile
     (register-command! (make-command "hello-world"
       #:command-class COMMAND_USER
       #:doc "Greet the whole world."
       #:invoke (lambda (self args from-tty) (display "Hello, World!\n"))))
     end
     (gdb) hello-world
     Hello, World!

23.3.3.12 Parameters In Guile
.............................

You can implement new GDB "parameters" using Guile (1).

   There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in GDB.
Two examples are: 'set follow-fork' and 'set charset'.  Setting these
parameters influences certain behavior in GDB.  Similarly, you can
define parameters that can be used to influence behavior in custom Guile
scripts and commands.

   A new parameter is defined with the 'make-parameter' Guile function,
and added to GDB with the 'register-parameter!' Guile function.  This
two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding the
parameter to GDB from 'make-parameter'.

   Parameters are exposed to the user via the 'set' and 'show' commands.
*Note Help::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: (make-parameter name [#:command-class
          command-class] [#:parameter-type parameter-type] [#:enum-list
          enum-list] [#:set-func set-func] [#:show-func show-func]
          [#:doc doc] [#:set-doc set-doc] [#:show-doc show-doc]
          [#:initial-value initial-value])

     The argument NAME is the name of the new parameter.  If NAME
     consists of multiple words, then the initial words are looked for
     as prefix parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with
     the 'set print' set of parameters.  If NAME is 'print foo', then
     'print' will be searched as the prefix parameter.  In this case the
     parameter can subsequently be accessed in GDB as 'set print foo'.
     If NAME consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
     can be found, an exception is raised.

     The result is the '<gdb:parameter>' object representing the
     parameter.  The parameter is not usable until it has been
     registered with GDB with 'register-parameter!'.

     The rest of the arguments are optional.

     The argument COMMAND-CLASS should be one of the 'COMMAND_'
     constants (*note Commands In Guile::).  This argument tells GDB how
     to categorize the new parameter in the help system.  The default is
     'COMMAND_NONE'.

     The argument PARAMETER-TYPE should be one of the 'PARAM_' constants
     defined below.  This argument tells GDB the type of the new
     parameter; this information is used for input validation and
     completion.  The default is 'PARAM_BOOLEAN'.

     If PARAMETER-TYPE is 'PARAM_ENUM', then ENUM-LIST must be a list of
     strings.  These strings represent the possible values for the
     parameter.

     If PARAMETER-TYPE is not 'PARAM_ENUM', then the presence of
     ENUM-LIST will cause an exception to be thrown.

     The argument SET-FUNC is a function of one argument: SELF which is
     the '<gdb:parameter>' object representing the parameter.  GDB will
     call this function when a PARAMETER's value has been changed via
     the 'set' API (for example, 'set foo off').  The value of the
     parameter has already been set to the new value.  This function
     must return a string to be displayed to the user.  GDB will add a
     trailing newline if the string is non-empty.  GDB generally doesn't
     print anything when a parameter is set, thus typically this
     function should return '""'.  A non-empty string result should
     typically be used for displaying warnings and errors.

     The argument SHOW-FUNC is a function of two arguments: SELF which
     is the '<gdb:parameter>' object representing the parameter, and
     SVALUE which is the string representation of the current value.
     GDB will call this function when a PARAMETER's 'show' API has been
     invoked (for example, 'show foo').  This function must return a
     string, and will be displayed to the user.  GDB will add a trailing
     newline.

     The argument DOC is the help text for the new parameter.  If there
     is no documentation string, a default value is used.

     The argument SET-DOC is the help text for this parameter's 'set'
     command.

     The argument SHOW-DOC is the help text for this parameter's 'show'
     command.

     The argument INITIAL-VALUE specifies the initial value of the
     parameter.  If it is a function, it takes one parameter, the
     '<gdb:parameter>' object and its result is used as the initial
     value of the parameter.  The initial value must be valid for the
     parameter type, otherwise an exception is thrown.

 -- Scheme Procedure: register-parameter! parameter
     Add PARAMETER, a '<gdb:parameter>' object, to GDB's list of
     parameters.  It is an error to register a parameter more than once.
     The result is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parameter? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:parameter>' object.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: parameter-value parameter
     Return the value of PARAMETER which may either be a
     '<gdb:parameter>' object or a string naming the parameter.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-parameter-value! parameter new-value
     Assign PARAMETER the value of NEW-VALUE.  The argument PARAMETER
     must be an object of type '<gdb:parameter>'.  GDB does validation
     when assignments are made.

   When a new parameter is defined, its type must be specified.  The
available types are represented by constants defined in the 'gdb'
module:

'PARAM_BOOLEAN'
     The value is a plain boolean.  The Guile boolean values, '#t' and
     '#f' are the only valid values.

'PARAM_AUTO_BOOLEAN'
     The value has three possible states: true, false, and 'auto'.  In
     Guile, true and false are represented using boolean constants, and
     'auto' is represented using '#:auto'.

'PARAM_UINTEGER'
     The value is an unsigned integer.  The value of 0 should be
     interpreted to mean "unlimited".

'PARAM_ZINTEGER'
     The value is an integer.

'PARAM_ZUINTEGER'
     The value is an unsigned integer.

'PARAM_ZUINTEGER_UNLIMITED'
     The value is an integer in the range '[0, INT_MAX]'.  A value of
     '-1' means "unlimited", and other negative numbers are not allowed.

'PARAM_STRING'
     The value is a string.  When the user modifies the string, any
     escape sequences, such as '\t', '\f', and octal escapes, are
     translated into corresponding characters and encoded into the
     current host charset.

'PARAM_STRING_NOESCAPE'
     The value is a string.  When the user modifies the string, escapes
     are passed through untranslated.

'PARAM_OPTIONAL_FILENAME'
     The value is a either a filename (a string), or '#f'.

'PARAM_FILENAME'
     The value is a filename.  This is just like
     'PARAM_STRING_NOESCAPE', but uses file names for completion.

'PARAM_ENUM'
     The value is a string, which must be one of a collection of string
     constants provided when the parameter is created.

   (1) Note that GDB parameters must not be confused with Guiles
parameter objects (*note (guile)Parameters::).

23.3.3.13 Program Spaces In Guile
.................................

A program space, or "progspace", represents a symbolic view of an
address space.  It consists of all of the objfiles of the program.
*Note Objfiles In Guile::.  *Note program spaces: Inferiors and
Programs, for more details about program spaces.

   Each progspace is represented by an instance of the '<gdb:progspace>'
smob.  *Note GDB Scheme Data Types::.

   The following progspace-related functions are available in the
'(gdb)' module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: progspace? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:progspace>' object.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: progspace-valid? progspace
     Return '#t' if PROGSPACE is valid, '#f' if not.  A
     '<gdb:progspace>' object can become invalid if the program it
     refers to is not loaded in GDB any longer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-progspace
     This function returns the program space of the currently selected
     inferior.  There is always a current progspace, this never returns
     '#f'.  *Note Inferiors and Programs::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: progspaces
     Return a list of all the progspaces currently known to GDB.

 -- Scheme Procedure: progspace-filename progspace
     Return the absolute file name of PROGSPACE as a string.  This is
     the name of the file passed as the argument to the 'file' or
     'symbol-file' commands.  If the program space does not have an
     associated file name, then '#f' is returned.  This occurs, for
     example, when GDB is started without a program to debug.

     A 'gdb:invalid-object-error' exception is thrown if PROGSPACE is
     invalid.

 -- Scheme Procedure: progspace-objfiles progspace
     Return the list of objfiles of PROGSPACE.  The order of objfiles in
     the result is arbitrary.  Each element is an object of type
     '<gdb:objfile>'.  *Note Objfiles In Guile::.

     A 'gdb:invalid-object-error' exception is thrown if PROGSPACE is
     invalid.

 -- Scheme Procedure: progspace-pretty-printers progspace
     Return the list of pretty-printers of PROGSPACE.  Each element is
     an object of type '<gdb:pretty-printer>'.  *Note Guile Pretty
     Printing API::, for more information.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-progspace-pretty-printers! progspace
          printer-list
     Set the list of registered '<gdb:pretty-printer>' objects for
     PROGSPACE to PRINTER-LIST.  *Note Guile Pretty Printing API::, for
     more information.

23.3.3.14 Objfiles In Guile
...........................

GDB loads symbols for an inferior from various symbol-containing files
(*note Files::).  These include the primary executable file, any shared
libraries used by the inferior, and any separate debug info files (*note
Separate Debug Files::).  GDB calls these symbol-containing files
"objfiles".

   Each objfile is represented as an object of type '<gdb:objfile>'.

   The following objfile-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: objfile? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:objfile>' object.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: objfile-valid? objfile
     Return '#t' if OBJFILE is valid, '#f' if not.  A '<gdb:objfile>'
     object can become invalid if the object file it refers to is not
     loaded in GDB any longer.  All other '<gdb:objfile>' procedures
     will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the procedure
     is called.

 -- Scheme Procedure: objfile-filename objfile
     Return the file name of OBJFILE as a string.

 -- Scheme Procedure: objfile-pretty-printers objfile
     Return the list of registered '<gdb:pretty-printer>' objects for
     OBJFILE.  *Note Guile Pretty Printing API::, for more information.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-objfile-pretty-printers! objfile printer-list
     Set the list of registered '<gdb:pretty-printer>' objects for
     OBJFILE to PRINTER-LIST.  The PRINTER-LIST must be a list of
     '<gdb:pretty-printer>' objects.  *Note Guile Pretty Printing API::,
     for more information.

 -- Scheme Procedure: current-objfile
     When auto-loading a Guile script (*note Guile Auto-loading::), GDB
     sets the "current objfile" to the corresponding objfile.  This
     function returns the current objfile.  If there is no current
     objfile, this function returns '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: objfiles
     Return a list of all the objfiles in the current program space.

23.3.3.15 Accessing inferior stack frames from Guile.
.....................................................

When the debugged program stops, GDB is able to analyze its call stack
(*note Stack frames: Frames.).  The '<gdb:frame>' class represents a
frame in the stack.  A '<gdb:frame>' object is only valid while its
corresponding frame exists in the inferior's stack.  If you try to use
an invalid frame object, GDB will throw a 'gdb:invalid-object' exception
(*note Guile Exception Handling::).

   Two '<gdb:frame>' objects can be compared for equality with the
'equal?' function, like:

     (gdb) guile (equal? (newest-frame) (selected-frame))
     #t

   The following frame-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:frame>' object.  Otherwise return
     '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-valid? frame
     Returns '#t' if FRAME is valid, '#f' if not.  A frame object can
     become invalid if the frame it refers to doesn't exist anymore in
     the inferior.  All '<gdb:frame>' procedures will throw an exception
     if the frame is invalid at the time the procedure is called.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-name frame
     Return the function name of FRAME, or '#f' if it can't be obtained.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-arch frame
     Return the '<gdb:architecture>' object corresponding to FRAME's
     architecture.  *Note Architectures In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-type frame
     Return the type of FRAME.  The value can be one of:

     'NORMAL_FRAME'
          An ordinary stack frame.

     'DUMMY_FRAME'
          A fake stack frame that was created by GDB when performing an
          inferior function call.

     'INLINE_FRAME'
          A frame representing an inlined function.  The function was
          inlined into a 'NORMAL_FRAME' that is older than this one.

     'TAILCALL_FRAME'
          A frame representing a tail call.  *Note Tail Call Frames::.

     'SIGTRAMP_FRAME'
          A signal trampoline frame.  This is the frame created by the
          OS when it calls into a signal handler.

     'ARCH_FRAME'
          A fake stack frame representing a cross-architecture call.

     'SENTINEL_FRAME'
          This is like 'NORMAL_FRAME', but it is only used for the
          newest frame.

 -- Scheme Procedure: frame-unwind-stop-reason frame
     Return an integer representing the reason why it's not possible to
     find more frames toward the outermost frame.  Use
     'unwind-stop-reason-string' to convert the value returned by this
     function to a string.  The value can be one of:

     'FRAME_UNWIND_NO_REASON'
          No particular reason (older frames should be available).

     'FRAME_UNWIND_NULL_ID'
          The previous frame's analyzer returns an invalid result.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_OUTERMOST'
          This frame is the outermost.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_UNAVAILABLE'
          Cannot unwind further, because that would require knowing the
          values of registers or memory that have not been collected.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_INNER_ID'
          This frame ID looks like it ought to belong to a NEXT frame,
          but we got it for a PREV frame.  Normally, this is a sign of
          unwinder failure.  It could also indicate stack corruption.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_SAME_ID'
          This frame has the same ID as the previous one.  That means
          that unwinding further would almost certainly give us another
          frame with exactly the same ID, so break the chain.  Normally,
          this is a sign of unwinder failure.  It could also indicate
          stack corruption.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_NO_SAVED_PC'
          The frame unwinder did not find any saved PC, but we needed
          one to unwind further.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_MEMORY_ERROR'
          The frame unwinder caused an error while trying to access
          memory.

     'FRAME_UNWIND_FIRST_ERROR'
          Any stop reason greater or equal to this value indicates some
          kind of error.  This special value facilitates writing code
          that tests for errors in unwinding in a way that will work
          correctly even if the list of the other values is modified in
          future GDB versions.  Using it, you could write:

               (define reason (frame-unwind-stop-readon (selected-frame)))
               (define reason-str (unwind-stop-reason-string reason))
               (if (>= reason FRAME_UNWIND_FIRST_ERROR)
                   (format #t "An error occured: ~s\n" reason-str))

23.3.3.16 Accessing blocks from Guile.
......................................

In GDB, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds roughly to a
scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized hierarchically, and are
represented individually in Guile as an object of type '<gdb:block>'.
Blocks rely on debugging information being available.

   A frame has a block.  Please see *note Frames In Guile::, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.

   The outermost block is known as the "global block".  The global block
typically holds public global variables and functions.

   The block nested just inside the global block is the "static block".
The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and functions.

   GDB provides a method to get a block's superblock, but there is
currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to iterate
over all the blocks in a symbol table (*note Symbol Tables In Guile::).

   Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:

     /* This is in the global block.  */
     int global;

     /* This is in the static block.  */
     static int file_scope;

     /* 'function' is in the global block, and 'argument' is
        in a block nested inside of 'function'.  */
     int function (int argument)
     {
       /* 'local' is in a block inside 'function'.  It may or may
          not be in the same block as 'argument'.  */
       int local;

       {
          /* 'inner' is in a block whose superblock is the one holding
             'local'.  */
          int inner;

          /* If this call is expanded by the compiler, you may see
             a nested block here whose function is 'inline_function'
             and whose superblock is the one holding 'inner'.  */
          inline_function ();
       }
     }

   The following block-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: block? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:block>' object.  Otherwise return
     '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-valid? block
     Returns '#t' if '<gdb:block>' BLOCK is valid, '#f' if not.  A block
     object can become invalid if the block it refers to doesn't exist
     anymore in the inferior.  All other '<gdb:block>' methods will
     throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the procedure is
     called.  The block's validity is also checked during iteration over
     symbols of the block.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-start block
     Return the start address of '<gdb:block>' BLOCK.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-end block
     Return the end address of '<gdb:block>' BLOCK.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-function block
     Return the name of '<gdb:block>' BLOCK represented as a
     '<gdb:symbol>' object.  If the block is not named, then '#f' is
     returned.

     For ordinary function blocks, the superblock is the static block.
     However, you should note that it is possible for a function block
     to have a superblock that is not the static block - for instance
     this happens for an inlined function.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-superblock block
     Return the block containing '<gdb:block>' BLOCK.  If the parent
     block does not exist, then '#f' is returned.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-global-block block
     Return the global block associated with '<gdb:block>' BLOCK.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-static-block block
     Return the static block associated with '<gdb:block>' BLOCK.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-global? block
     Return '#t' if '<gdb:block>' BLOCK is a global block.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-static? block
     Return '#t' if '<gdb:block>' BLOCK is a static block.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-symbols
     Return a list of all symbols (as <gdb:symbol> objects) in
     '<gdb:block>' BLOCK.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-block-symbols-iterator block
     Return an object of type '<gdb:iterator>' that will iterate over
     all symbols of the block.  Guile programs should not assume that a
     specific block object will always contain a given symbol, since
     changes in GDB features and infrastructure may cause symbols move
     across blocks in a symbol table.  *Note Iterators In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: block-symbols-progress?
     Return #t if the object is a <gdb:block-symbols-progress> object.
     This object would be obtained from the 'progress' element of the
     '<gdb:iterator>' object returned by 'make-block-symbols-iterator'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookup-block pc
     Return the innermost '<gdb:block>' containing the given PC value.
     If the block cannot be found for the PC value specified, the
     function will return '#f'.

23.3.3.17 Guile representation of Symbols.
..........................................

GDB represents every variable, function and type as an entry in a symbol
table.  *Note Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols.  Guile represents
these symbols in GDB with the '<gdb:symbol>' object.

   The following symbol-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:symbol>'.
     Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-valid? symbol
     Return '#t' if the '<gdb:symbol>' object is valid, '#f' if not.  A
     '<gdb:symbol>' object can become invalid if the symbol it refers to
     does not exist in GDB any longer.  All other '<gdb:symbol>'
     procedures will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the
     procedure is called.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-type symbol
     Return the type of SYMBOL or '#f' if no type is recorded.  The
     result is an object of type '<gdb:type>'.  *Note Types In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-symtab symbol
     Return the symbol table in which SYMBOL appears.  The result is an
     object of type '<gdb:symtab>'.  *Note Symbol Tables In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-line symbol
     Return the line number in the source code at which SYMBOL was
     defined.  This is an integer.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-name symbol
     Return the name of SYMBOL as a string.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-linkage-name symbol
     Return the name of SYMBOL, as used by the linker (i.e., may be
     mangled).

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-print-name symbol
     Return the name of SYMBOL in a form suitable for output.  This is
     either 'name' or 'linkage_name', depending on whether the user
     asked GDB to display demangled or mangled names.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-addr-class symbol
     Return the address class of the symbol.  This classifies how to
     find the value of a symbol.  Each address class is a constant
     defined in the '(gdb)' module and described later in this chapter.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-needs-frame? symbol
     Return '#t' if evaluating SYMBOL's value requires a frame (*note
     Frames In Guile::) and '#f' otherwise.  Typically, local variables
     will require a frame, but other symbols will not.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-argument? symbol
     Return '#t' if SYMBOL is an argument of a function.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-constant? symbol
     Return '#t' if SYMBOL is a constant.  Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-function? symbol
     Return '#t' if SYMBOL is a function or a method.  Otherwise return
     '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-variable? symbol
     Return '#t' if SYMBOL is a variable.  Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symbol-value symbol [#:frame frame]
     Compute the value of SYMBOL, as a '<gdb:value>'.  For functions,
     this computes the address of the function, cast to the appropriate
     type.  If the symbol requires a frame in order to compute its
     value, then FRAME must be given.  If FRAME is not given, or if
     FRAME is invalid, then an exception is thrown.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookup-symbol name [#:block block] [#:domain
          domain]
     This function searches for a symbol by name.  The search scope can
     be restricted to the parameters defined in the optional domain and
     block arguments.

     NAME is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The optional
     BLOCK argument restricts the search to symbols visible in that
     BLOCK.  The BLOCK argument must be a '<gdb:block>' object.  If
     omitted, the block for the current frame is used.  The optional
     DOMAIN argument restricts the search to the domain type.  The
     DOMAIN argument must be a domain constant defined in the '(gdb)'
     module and described later in this chapter.

     The result is a list of two elements.  The first element is a
     '<gdb:symbol>' object or '#f' if the symbol is not found.  If the
     symbol is found, the second element is '#t' if the symbol is a
     field of a method's object (e.g., 'this' in C++), otherwise it is
     '#f'.  If the symbol is not found, the second element is '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lookup-global-symbol name [#:domain domain]
     This function searches for a global symbol by name.  The search
     scope can be restricted by the domain argument.

     NAME is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The optional
     DOMAIN argument restricts the search to the domain type.  The
     DOMAIN argument must be a domain constant defined in the '(gdb)'
     module and described later in this chapter.

     The result is a '<gdb:symbol>' object or '#f' if the symbol is not
     found.

   The available domain categories in '<gdb:symbol>' are represented as
constants in the '(gdb)' module:

'SYMBOL_UNDEF_DOMAIN'
     This is used when a domain has not been discovered or none of the
     following domains apply.  This usually indicates an error either in
     the symbol information or in GDB's handling of symbols.

'SYMBOL_VAR_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains variables, function names, typedef names and
     enum type values.

'SYMBOL_STRUCT_DOMAIN'
     This domain holds struct, union and enum type names.

'SYMBOL_LABEL_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains names of labels (for gotos).

'SYMBOL_VARIABLES_DOMAIN'
     This domain holds a subset of the 'SYMBOLS_VAR_DOMAIN'; it contains
     everything minus functions and types.

'SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains all functions.

'SYMBOL_TYPES_DOMAIN'
     This domain contains all types.

   The available address class categories in '<gdb:symbol>' are
represented as constants in the 'gdb' module:

'SYMBOL_LOC_UNDEF'
     If this is returned by address class, it indicates an error either
     in the symbol information or in GDB's handling of symbols.

'SYMBOL_LOC_CONST'
     Value is constant int.

'SYMBOL_LOC_STATIC'
     Value is at a fixed address.

'SYMBOL_LOC_REGISTER'
     Value is in a register.

'SYMBOL_LOC_ARG'
     Value is an argument.  This value is at the offset stored within
     the symbol inside the frame's argument list.

'SYMBOL_LOC_REF_ARG'
     Value address is stored in the frame's argument list.  Just like
     'LOC_ARG' except that the value's address is stored at the offset,
     not the value itself.

'SYMBOL_LOC_REGPARM_ADDR'
     Value is a specified register.  Just like 'LOC_REGISTER' except the
     register holds the address of the argument instead of the argument
     itself.

'SYMBOL_LOC_LOCAL'
     Value is a local variable.

'SYMBOL_LOC_TYPEDEF'
     Value not used.  Symbols in the domain 'SYMBOL_STRUCT_DOMAIN' all
     have this class.

'SYMBOL_LOC_BLOCK'
     Value is a block.

'SYMBOL_LOC_CONST_BYTES'
     Value is a byte-sequence.

'SYMBOL_LOC_UNRESOLVED'
     Value is at a fixed address, but the address of the variable has to
     be determined from the minimal symbol table whenever the variable
     is referenced.

'SYMBOL_LOC_OPTIMIZED_OUT'
     The value does not actually exist in the program.

'SYMBOL_LOC_COMPUTED'
     The value's address is a computed location.

23.3.3.18 Symbol table representation in Guile.
...............................................

Access to symbol table data maintained by GDB on the inferior is exposed
to Guile via two objects: '<gdb:sal>' (symtab-and-line) and
'<gdb:symtab>'.  Symbol table and line data for a frame is returned from
the 'frame-find-sal' '<gdb:frame>' procedure.  *Note Frames In Guile::.

   For more information on GDB's symbol table management, see *note
Examining the Symbol Table: Symbols.

   The following symtab-related procedures are provided by the '(gdb)'
module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:symtab>'.
     Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab-valid? symtab
     Return '#t' if the '<gdb:symtab>' object is valid, '#f' if not.  A
     '<gdb:symtab>' object becomes invalid when the symbol table it
     refers to no longer exists in GDB.  All other '<gdb:symtab>'
     procedures will throw an exception if it is invalid at the time the
     procedure is called.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab-filename symtab
     Return the symbol table's source filename.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab-fullname symtab
     Return the symbol table's source absolute file name.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab-objfile symtab
     Return the symbol table's backing object file.  *Note Objfiles In
     Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab-global-block symtab
     Return the global block of the underlying symbol table.  *Note
     Blocks In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: symtab-static-block symtab
     Return the static block of the underlying symbol table.  *Note
     Blocks In Guile::.

   The following symtab-and-line-related procedures are provided by the
'(gdb)' module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: sal? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:sal>'.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sal-valid? sal
     Return '#t' if SAL is valid, '#f' if not.  A '<gdb:sal>' object
     becomes invalid when the Symbol table object it refers to no longer
     exists in GDB.  All other '<gdb:sal>' procedures will throw an
     exception if it is invalid at the time the procedure is called.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sal-symtab sal
     Return the symbol table object ('<gdb:symtab>') for SAL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sal-line sal
     Return the line number for SAL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sal-pc sal
     Return the start of the address range occupied by code for SAL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: sal-last sal
     Return the end of the address range occupied by code for SAL.

 -- Scheme Procedure: find-pc-line pc
     Return the '<gdb:sal>' object corresponding to the PC value.  If an
     invalid value of PC is passed as an argument, then the 'symtab' and
     'line' attributes of the returned '<gdb:sal>' object will be '#f'
     and 0 respectively.

23.3.3.19 Manipulating breakpoints using Guile
..............................................

Breakpoints in Guile are represented by objects of type
'<gdb:breakpoint>'.  New breakpoints can be created with the
'make-breakpoint' Guile function, and then added to GDB with the
'register-breakpoint!' Guile function.  This two-step approach is taken
to separate out the side-effect of adding the breakpoint to GDB from
'make-breakpoint'.

   Support is also provided to view and manipulate breakpoints created
outside of Guile.

   The following breakpoint-related procedures are provided by the
'(gdb)' module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-breakpoint location [#:type type] [#:wp-class
          wp-class] [#:internal internal]
     Create a new breakpoint at LOCATION, a string naming the location
     of the breakpoint, or an expression that defines a watchpoint.  The
     contents can be any location recognized by the 'break' command, or
     in the case of a watchpoint, by the 'watch' command.

     The breakpoint is initially marked as 'invalid'.  The breakpoint is
     not usable until it has been registered with GDB with
     'register-breakpoint!', at which point it becomes 'valid'.  The
     result is the '<gdb:breakpoint>' object representing the
     breakpoint.

     The optional TYPE denotes the breakpoint to create.  This argument
     can be either 'BP_BREAKPOINT' or 'BP_WATCHPOINT', and defaults to
     'BP_BREAKPOINT'.

     The optional WP-CLASS argument defines the class of watchpoint to
     create, if TYPE is 'BP_WATCHPOINT'.  If a watchpoint class is not
     provided, it is assumed to be a 'WP_WRITE' class.

     The optional INTERNAL argument allows the breakpoint to become
     invisible to the user.  The breakpoint will neither be reported
     when registered, nor will it be listed in the output from 'info
     breakpoints' (but will be listed with the 'maint info breakpoints'
     command).  If an internal flag is not provided, the breakpoint is
     visible (non-internal).

     When a watchpoint is created, GDB will try to create a hardware
     assisted watchpoint.  If successful, the type of the watchpoint is
     changed from 'BP_WATCHPOINT' to 'BP_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINT' for
     'WP_WRITE', 'BP_READ_WATCHPOINT' for 'WP_READ', and
     'BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT' for 'WP_ACCESS'.  If not successful, the
     type of the watchpoint is left as 'WP_WATCHPOINT'.

     The available types are represented by constants defined in the
     'gdb' module:

     'BP_BREAKPOINT'
          Normal code breakpoint.

     'BP_WATCHPOINT'
          Watchpoint breakpoint.

     'BP_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINT'
          Hardware assisted watchpoint.  This value cannot be specified
          when creating the breakpoint.

     'BP_READ_WATCHPOINT'
          Hardware assisted read watchpoint.  This value cannot be
          specified when creating the breakpoint.

     'BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT'
          Hardware assisted access watchpoint.  This value cannot be
          specified when creating the breakpoint.

     The available watchpoint types represented by constants are defined
     in the '(gdb)' module:

     'WP_READ'
          Read only watchpoint.

     'WP_WRITE'
          Write only watchpoint.

     'WP_ACCESS'
          Read/Write watchpoint.

 -- Scheme Procedure: register-breakpoint! breakpoint
     Add BREAKPOINT, a '<gdb:breakpoint>' object, to GDB's list of
     breakpoints.  The breakpoint must have been created with
     'make-breakpoint'.  One cannot register breakpoints that have been
     created outside of Guile.  Once a breakpoint is registered it
     becomes 'valid'.  It is an error to register an already registered
     breakpoint.  The result is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: delete-breakpoint! breakpoint
     Remove BREAKPOINT from GDB's list of breakpoints.  This also
     invalidates the Guile BREAKPOINT object.  Any further attempt to
     access the object will throw an exception.

     If BREAKPOINT was created from Guile with 'make-breakpoint' it may
     be re-registered with GDB, in which case the breakpoint becomes
     valid again.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoints
     Return a list of all breakpoints.  Each element of the list is a
     '<gdb:breakpoint>' object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:breakpoint>' object, and '#f'
     otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-valid? breakpoint
     Return '#t' if BREAKPOINT is valid, '#f' otherwise.  Breakpoints
     created with 'make-breakpoint' are marked as invalid until they are
     registered with GDB with 'register-breakpoint!'.  A
     '<gdb:breakpoint>' object can become invalid if the user deletes
     the breakpoint.  In this case, the object still exists, but the
     underlying breakpoint does not.  In the cases of watchpoint scope,
     the watchpoint remains valid even if execution of the inferior
     leaves the scope of that watchpoint.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-number breakpoint
     Return the breakpoint's number -- the identifier used by the user
     to manipulate the breakpoint.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-type breakpoint
     Return the breakpoint's type -- the identifier used to determine
     the actual breakpoint type or use-case.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-visible? breakpoint
     Return '#t' if the breakpoint is visible to the user when hit, or
     when the 'info breakpoints' command is run.  Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-location breakpoint
     Return the location of the breakpoint, as specified by the user.
     It is a string.  If the breakpoint does not have a location (that
     is, it is a watchpoint) return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-expression breakpoint
     Return the breakpoint expression, as specified by the user.  It is
     a string.  If the breakpoint does not have an expression (the
     breakpoint is not a watchpoint) return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-enabled? breakpoint
     Return '#t' if the breakpoint is enabled, and '#f' otherwise.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-enabled! breakpoint flag
     Set the enabled state of BREAKPOINT to FLAG.  If flag is '#f' it is
     disabled, otherwise it is enabled.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-silent? breakpoint
     Return '#t' if the breakpoint is silent, and '#f' otherwise.

     Note that a breakpoint can also be silent if it has commands and
     the first command is 'silent'.  This is not reported by the
     'silent' attribute.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-silent! breakpoint flag
     Set the silent state of BREAKPOINT to FLAG.  If flag is '#f' the
     breakpoint is made silent, otherwise it is made non-silent (or
     noisy).

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-ignore-count breakpoint
     Return the ignore count for BREAKPOINT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-ignore-count! breakpoint count
     Set the ignore count for BREAKPOINT to COUNT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-hit-count breakpoint
     Return hit count of BREAKPOINT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-hit-count! breakpoint count
     Set the hit count of BREAKPOINT to COUNT.  At present, COUNT must
     be zero.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-thread breakpoint
     Return the thread-id for thread-specific breakpoint BREAKPOINT.
     Return #f if BREAKPOINT is not thread-specific.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-thread! breakpoint thread-id|#f
     Set the thread-id for BREAKPOINT to THREAD-ID.  If set to '#f', the
     breakpoint is no longer thread-specific.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-task breakpoint
     If the breakpoint is Ada task-specific, return the Ada task id.  If
     the breakpoint is not task-specific (or the underlying language is
     not Ada), return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-task! breakpoint task
     Set the Ada task of BREAKPOINT to TASK.  If set to '#f', the
     breakpoint is no longer task-specific.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-condition breakpoint
     Return the condition of BREAKPOINT, as specified by the user.  It
     is a string.  If there is no condition, return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-condition! breakpoint condition
     Set the condition of BREAKPOINT to CONDITION, which must be a
     string.  If set to '#f' then the breakpoint becomes unconditional.

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-stop breakpoint
     Return the stop predicate of BREAKPOINT.  See
     'set-breakpoint-stop!' below in this section.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-breakpoint-stop! breakpoint procedure|#f
     Set the stop predicate of BREAKPOINT.  The predicate PROCEDURE
     takes one argument: the <gdb:breakpoint> object.  If this predicate
     is set to a procedure then it is invoked whenever the inferior
     reaches this breakpoint.  If it returns '#t', or any non-'#f'
     value, then the inferior is stopped, otherwise the inferior will
     continue.

     If there are multiple breakpoints at the same location with a
     'stop' predicate, each one will be called regardless of the return
     status of the previous.  This ensures that all 'stop' predicates
     have a chance to execute at that location.  In this scenario if one
     of the methods returns '#t' but the others return '#f', the
     inferior will still be stopped.

     You should not alter the execution state of the inferior (i.e.,
     step, next, etc.), alter the current frame context (i.e., change
     the current active frame), or alter, add or delete any breakpoint.
     As a general rule, you should not alter any data within GDB or the
     inferior at this time.

     Example 'stop' implementation:

          (define (my-stop? bkpt)
            (let ((int-val (parse-and-eval "foo")))
              (value=? int-val 3)))
          (define bkpt (make-breakpoint "main.c:42"))
          (register-breakpoint! bkpt)
          (set-breakpoint-stop! bkpt my-stop?)

 -- Scheme Procedure: breakpoint-commands breakpoint
     Return the commands attached to BREAKPOINT as a string, or '#f' if
     there are none.

23.3.3.20 Guile representation of lazy strings.
...............................................

A "lazy string" is a string whose contents is not retrieved or encoded
until it is needed.

   A '<gdb:lazy-string>' is represented in GDB as an 'address' that
points to a region of memory, an 'encoding' that will be used to encode
that region of memory, and a 'length' to delimit the region of memory
that represents the string.  The difference between a
'<gdb:lazy-string>' and a string wrapped within a '<gdb:value>' is that
a '<gdb:lazy-string>' will be treated differently by GDB when printing.
A '<gdb:lazy-string>' is retrieved and encoded during printing, while a
'<gdb:value>' wrapping a string is immediately retrieved and encoded on
creation.

   The following lazy-string-related procedures are provided by the
'(gdb)' module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: lazy-string? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:lazy-string>'.
     Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lazy-string-address lazy-sring
     Return the address of LAZY-STRING.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lazy-string-length lazy-string
     Return the length of LAZY-STRING in characters.  If the length is
     -1, then the string will be fetched and encoded up to the first
     null of appropriate width.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lazy-string-encoding lazy-string
     Return the encoding that will be applied to LAZY-STRING when the
     string is printed by GDB.  If the encoding is not set, or contains
     an empty string, then GDB will select the most appropriate encoding
     when the string is printed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lazy-string-type lazy-string
     Return the type that is represented by LAZY-STRING's type.  For a
     lazy string this will always be a pointer type.  To resolve this to
     the lazy string's character type, use 'type-target-type'.  *Note
     Types In Guile::.

 -- Scheme Procedure: lazy-string->value lazy-string
     Convert the '<gdb:lazy-string>' to a '<gdb:value>'.  This value
     will point to the string in memory, but will lose all the delayed
     retrieval, encoding and handling that GDB applies to a
     '<gdb:lazy-string>'.

23.3.3.21 Guile representation of architectures
...............................................

GDB uses architecture specific parameters and artifacts in a number of
its various computations.  An architecture is represented by an instance
of the '<gdb:arch>' class.

   The following architecture-related procedures are provided by the
'(gdb)' module:

 -- Scheme Procedure: arch? object

23.3.3.22 Disassembly In Guile
..............................

The disassembler can be invoked from Scheme code.  Furthermore, the
disassembler can take a Guile port as input, allowing one to disassemble
from any source, and not just target memory.

 -- Scheme Procedure: arch-disassemble arch start-pc [#:port port]
          [#:offset offset] [#:size size] [#:count count]
     Return a list of disassembled instructions starting from the memory
     address START-PC.

     The optional argument PORT specifies the input port to read bytes
     from.  If PORT is '#f' then bytes are read from target memory.

     The optional argument OFFSET specifies the address offset of the
     first byte in PORT.  This is useful, for example, when PORT
     specifies a 'bytevector' and you want the bytevector to be
     disassembled as if it came from that address.  The START-PC passed
     to the reader for PORT is offset by the same amount.

     Example:
          (gdb) guile (use-modules (rnrs io ports))
          (gdb) guile (define pc (value->integer (parse-and-eval "$pc")))
          (gdb) guile (define mem (open-memory #:start pc))
          (gdb) guile (define bv (get-bytevector-n mem 10))
          (gdb) guile (define bv-port (open-bytevector-input-port bv))
          (gdb) guile (define arch (current-arch))
          (gdb) guile (arch-disassemble arch pc #:port bv-port #:offset pc)
          (((address . 4195516) (asm . "mov    $0x4005c8,%edi") (length . 5)))

     The optional arguments SIZE and COUNT determine the number of
     instructions in the returned list.  If either SIZE or COUNT is
     specified as zero, then no instructions are disassembled and an
     empty list is returned.  If both the optional arguments SIZE and
     COUNT are specified, then a list of at most COUNT disassembled
     instructions whose start address falls in the closed memory address
     interval from START-PC to (START-PC + SIZE - 1) are returned.  If
     SIZE is not specified, but COUNT is specified, then COUNT number of
     instructions starting from the address START-PC are returned.  If
     COUNT is not specified but SIZE is specified, then all instructions
     whose start address falls in the closed memory address interval
     from START-PC to (START-PC + SIZE - 1) are returned.  If neither
     SIZE nor COUNT are specified, then a single instruction at START-PC
     is returned.

     Each element of the returned list is an alist (associative list)
     with the following keys:

     'address'
          The value corresponding to this key is a Guile integer of the
          memory address of the instruction.

     'asm'
          The value corresponding to this key is a string value which
          represents the instruction with assembly language mnemonics.
          The assembly language flavor used is the same as that
          specified by the current CLI variable 'disassembly-flavor'.
          *Note Machine Code::.

     'length'
          The value corresponding to this key is the length of the
          instruction in bytes.

23.3.3.24 Memory Ports in Guile
...............................

GDB provides a 'port' interface to target memory.  This allows Guile
code to read/write target memory using Guile's port and bytevector
functionality.  The main routine is 'open-memory' which returns a port
object.  One can then read/write memory using that object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: open-memory [#:mode mode] [#:start address]
          [#:size size]
     Return a port object that can be used for reading and writing
     memory.  The port will be open according to MODE, which is the
     standard mode argument to Guile port open routines, except that it
     is restricted to one of '"r"', '"w"', or '"r+"'.  For compatibility
     '"b"' (binary) may also be present, but we ignore it: memory ports
     are binary only.  The default is '"r"', read-only.

     The chunk of memory that can be accessed can be bounded.  If both
     START and SIZE are unspecified, all of memory can be accessed.  If
     only START is specified, all of memory from that point on can be
     accessed.  If only SIZE if specified, all memory in the range
     [0,SIZE) can be accessed.  If both are specified, all memory in the
     rane [START,START+SIZE) can be accessed.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memory-port?
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is an object of type '<gdb:memory-port>'.
     Otherwise return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memory-port-range memory-port
     Return the range of '<gdb:memory-port>' MEMORY-PORT as a list of
     two elements: '(start end)'.  The range is START to END inclusive.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memory-port-read-buffer-size memory-port
     Return the size of the read buffer of '<gdb:memory-port>'
     MEMORY-PORT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-memory-port-read-buffer-size! memory-port size
     Set the size of the read buffer of '<gdb:memory-port>' MEMORY-PORT
     to SIZE.  The result is unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: memory-port-write-buffer-size memory-port
     Return the size of the write buffer of '<gdb:memory-port>'
     MEMORY-PORT.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-memory-port-write-buffer-size! memory-port
          size
     Set the size of the write buffer of '<gdb:memory-port>' MEMORY-PORT
     to SIZE.  The result is unspecified.

   A memory port is closed like any other port, with 'close-port'.

   Combined with Guile's 'bytevectors', memory ports provide a lot of
utility.  For example, to fill a buffer of 10 integers in memory, one
can do something like the following.

     ;; In the program: int buffer[10];
     (use-modules (rnrs bytevectors))
     (use-modules (rnrs io ports))
     (define addr (parse-and-eval "buffer"))
     (define n 10)
     (define byte-size (* n 4))
     (define mem-port (open-memory #:mode "r+" #:start
                                   (value->integer addr) #:size byte-size))
     (define byte-vec (make-bytevector byte-size))
     (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
         ((>= i n))
         (bytevector-s32-native-set! byte-vec (* i 4) (* i 42)))
     (put-bytevector mem-port byte-vec)
     (close-port mem-port)


File: gdb.info,  Node: Iterators In Guile,  Prev: Memory Ports in Guile,  Up: Guile API

23.3.3.25 Iterators In Guile
............................

A simple iterator facility is provided to allow, for example, iterating
over the set of program symbols without having to first construct a list
of all of them.  A useful contribution would be to add support for SRFI
41 and SRFI 45.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-iterator object progress next!
     A '<gdb:iterator>' object is constructed with the 'make-iterator'
     procedure.  It takes three arguments: the object to be iterated
     over, an object to record the progress of the iteration, and a
     procedure to return the next element in the iteration, or an
     implementation chosen value to denote the end of iteration.

     By convention, end of iteration is marked with
     '(end-of-iteration)', and may be tested with the
     'end-of-iteration?' predicate.  The result of '(end-of-iteration)'
     is chosen so that it is not otherwise used by the '(gdb)' module.
     If you are using '<gdb:iterator>' in your own code it is your
     responsibility to maintain this invariant.

     A trivial example for illustration's sake:

          (use-modules (gdb iterator))
          (define my-list (list 1 2 3))
          (define iter
            (make-iterator my-list my-list
                           (lambda (iter)
                             (let ((l (iterator-progress iter)))
                               (if (eq? l '())
                                   (end-of-iteration)
                                   (begin
                                     (set-iterator-progress! iter (cdr l))
                                     (car l)))))))

     Here is a slightly more realistic example, which computes a list of
     all the functions in 'my-global-block'.

          (use-modules (gdb iterator))
          (define this-sal (find-pc-line (frame-pc (selected-frame))))
          (define this-symtab (sal-symtab this-sal))
          (define this-global-block (symtab-global-block this-symtab))
          (define syms-iter (make-block-symbols-iterator this-global-block))
          (define functions (iterator-filter symbol-function? syms-iter))

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is a '<gdb:iterator>' object.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-object iterator
     Return the first argument that was passed to 'make-iterator'.  This
     is the object being iterated over.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-progress iterator
     Return the object tracking iteration progress.

 -- Scheme Procedure: set-iterator-progress! iterator new-value
     Set the object tracking iteration progress.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-next! iterator
     Invoke the procedure that was the third argument to
     'make-iterator', passing it one argument, the '<gdb:iterator>'
     object.  The result is either the next element in the iteration, or
     an end marker as implemented by the 'next!' procedure.  By
     convention the end marker is the result of '(end-of-iteration)'.

 -- Scheme Procedure: end-of-iteration
     Return the Scheme object that denotes end of iteration.

 -- Scheme Procedure: end-of-iteration? object
     Return '#t' if OBJECT is the end of iteration marker.  Otherwise
     return '#f'.

   These functions are provided by the '(gdb iterator)' module to assist
in using iterators.

 -- Scheme Procedure: make-list-iterator list
     Return a '<gdb:iterator>' object that will iterate over LIST.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator->list iterator
     Return the elements pointed to by ITERATOR as a list.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-map proc iterator
     Return the list of objects obtained by applying PROC to the object
     pointed to by ITERATOR and to each subsequent object.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-for-each proc iterator
     Apply PROC to each element pointed to by ITERATOR.  The result is
     unspecified.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-filter pred iterator
     Return the list of elements pointed to by ITERATOR that satisfy
     PRED.

 -- Scheme Procedure: iterator-until pred iterator
     Run ITERATOR until the result of '(pred element)' is true and
     return that as the result.  Otherwise return '#f'.

23.3.4 Guile Auto-loading
-------------------------

When a new object file is read (for example, due to the 'file' command,
or because the inferior has loaded a shared library), GDB will look for
Guile support scripts in two ways: 'OBJFILE-gdb.scm' and the
'.debug_gdb_scripts' section.  *Note Auto-loading extensions::.

   The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and scripts.

   Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled, and the list of auto-loaded
scripts can be printed.

'set auto-load guile-scripts [on|off]'
     Enable or disable the auto-loading of Guile scripts.

'show auto-load guile-scripts'
     Show whether auto-loading of Guile scripts is enabled or disabled.

'info auto-load guile-scripts [REGEXP]'
     Print the list of all Guile scripts that GDB auto-loaded.

     Also printed is the list of Guile scripts that were mentioned in
     the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section and were not found.  This is
     useful because their names are not printed when GDB tries to load
     them and fails.  There may be many of them, and printing an error
     message for each one is problematic.

     If REGEXP is supplied only Guile scripts with matching names are
     printed.

     Example:

          (gdb) info auto-load guile-scripts
          Loaded Script
          Yes    scm-section-script.scm
                 full name: /tmp/scm-section-script.scm
          No     my-foo-pretty-printers.scm

   When reading an auto-loaded file, GDB sets the "current objfile".
This is available via the 'current-objfile' procedure (*note Objfiles In
Guile::).  This can be useful for registering objfile-specific
pretty-printers.

23.4 Auto-loading extensions
============================

GDB provides two mechanisms for automatically loading extensions when a
new object file is read (for example, due to the 'file' command, or
because the inferior has loaded a shared library): 'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' and
the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section of modern file formats like ELF.

* Menu:

* objfile-gdb.ext file: objfile-gdbdotext file.  The 'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' file
* .debug_gdb_scripts section: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section.  The '.debug_gdb_scripts' section
* Which flavor to choose?::

   The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and features.

   Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled, and the list of auto-loaded
scripts can be printed.  See the 'auto-loading' section of each
extension language for more information.  For GDB command files see
*note Auto-loading sequences::.  For Python files see *note Python
Auto-loading::.

   Note that loading of this script file also requires accordingly
configured 'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).


File: gdb.info,  Node: objfile-gdbdotext file,  Next: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section,  Up: Auto-loading extensions

23.4.1 The 'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' file
---------------------------------

When a new object file is read, GDB looks for a file named
'OBJFILE-gdb.EXT' (we call it SCRIPT-NAME below), where OBJFILE is the
object file's name and where EXT is the file extension for the extension
language:

'OBJFILE-gdb.gdb'
     GDB's own command language
'OBJFILE-gdb.py'
     Python
'OBJFILE-gdb.scm'
     Guile

   SCRIPT-NAME is formed by ensuring that the file name of OBJFILE is
absolute, following all symlinks, and resolving '.' and '..' components,
and appending the '-gdb.EXT' suffix.  If this file exists and is
readable, GDB will evaluate it as a script in the specified extension
language.

   If this file does not exist, then GDB will look for SCRIPT-NAME file
in all of the directories as specified below.

   Note that loading of these files requires an accordingly configured
'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).

   For object files using '.exe' suffix GDB tries to load first the
scripts normally according to its '.exe' filename.  But if no scripts
are found GDB also tries script filenames matching the object file
without its '.exe' suffix.  This '.exe' stripping is case insensitive
and it is attempted on any platform.  This makes the script filenames
compatible between Unix and MS-Windows hosts.

'set auto-load scripts-directory [DIRECTORIES]'
     Control GDB auto-loaded scripts location.  Multiple directory
     entries may be delimited by the host platform path separator in use
     (':' on Unix, ';' on MS-Windows and MS-DOS).

     Each entry here needs to be covered also by the security setting
     'set auto-load safe-path' (*note set auto-load safe-path::).

     This variable defaults to '$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load'.  The
     default 'set auto-load safe-path' value can be also overriden by
     GDB configuration option '--with-auto-load-dir'.

     Any reference to '$debugdir' will get replaced by
     DEBUG-FILE-DIRECTORY value (*note Separate Debug Files::) and any
     reference to '$datadir' will get replaced by DATA-DIRECTORY which
     is determined at GDB startup (*note Data Files::).  '$debugdir' and
     '$datadir' must be placed as a directory component -- either alone
     or delimited by '/' or '\' directory separators, depending on the
     host platform.

     The list of directories uses path separator (':' on GNU and Unix
     systems, ';' on MS-Windows and MS-DOS) to separate directories,
     similarly to the 'PATH' environment variable.

'show auto-load scripts-directory'
     Show GDB auto-loaded scripts location.

   GDB does not track which files it has already auto-loaded this way.
GDB will load the associated script every time the corresponding OBJFILE
is opened.  So your '-gdb.EXT' file should be careful to avoid errors if
it is evaluated more than once.


File: gdb.info,  Node: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section,  Next: Which flavor to choose?,  Prev: objfile-gdbdotext file,  Up: Auto-loading extensions

23.4.2 The '.debug_gdb_scripts' section
---------------------------------------

For systems using file formats like ELF and COFF, when GDB loads a new
object file it will look for a special section named
'.debug_gdb_scripts'.  If this section exists, its contents is a list of
NUL-terminated names of scripts to load.  Each entry begins with a
non-NULL prefix byte that specifies the kind of entry, typically the
extension language.

   GDB will look for each specified script file first in the current
directory and then along the source search path (*note Specifying Source
Directories: Source Path.), except that '$cdir' is not searched, since
the compilation directory is not relevant to scripts.

   Entries can be placed in section '.debug_gdb_scripts' with, for
example, this GCC macro for Python scripts.

     /* Note: The "MS" section flags are to remove duplicates.  */
     #define DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT(script_name) \
       asm("\
     .pushsection \".debug_gdb_scripts\", \"MS\",@progbits,1\n\
     .byte 1 /* Python */\n\
     .asciz \"" script_name "\"\n\
     .popsection \n\
     ");

For Guile scripts, replace '.byte 1' with '.byte 3'.  Then one can
reference the macro in a header or source file like this:

     DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT ("my-app-scripts.py")

   The script name may include directories if desired.

   Note that loading of this script file also requires accordingly
configured 'auto-load safe-path' (*note Auto-loading safe path::).

   If the macro invocation is put in a header, any application or
library using this header will get a reference to the specified script,
and with the use of '"MS"' attributes on the section, the linker will
remove duplicates.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Which flavor to choose?,  Prev: dotdebug_gdb_scripts section,  Up: Auto-loading extensions

23.4.3 Which flavor to choose?
------------------------------

Given the multiple ways of auto-loading extensions, it might not always
be clear which one to choose.  This section provides some guidance.

Benefits of the '-gdb.EXT' way:

   * Can be used with file formats that don't support multiple sections.

   * Ease of finding scripts for public libraries.

     Scripts specified in the '.debug_gdb_scripts' section are searched
     for in the source search path.  For publicly installed libraries,
     e.g., 'libstdc++', there typically isn't a source directory in
     which to find the script.

   * Doesn't require source code additions.

Benefits of the '.debug_gdb_scripts' way:

   * Works with static linking.

     Scripts for libraries done the '-gdb.EXT' way require an objfile to
     trigger their loading.  When an application is statically linked
     the only objfile available is the executable, and it is cumbersome
     to attach all the scripts from all the input libraries to the
     executable's '-gdb.EXT' script.

   * Works with classes that are entirely inlined.

     Some classes can be entirely inlined, and thus there may not be an
     associated shared library to attach a '-gdb.EXT' script to.

   * Scripts needn't be copied out of the source tree.

     In some circumstances, apps can be built out of large collections
     of internal libraries, and the build infrastructure necessary to
     install the '-gdb.EXT' scripts in a place where GDB can find them
     is cumbersome.  It may be easier to specify the scripts in the
     '.debug_gdb_scripts' section as relative paths, and add a path to
     the top of the source tree to the source search path.

23.5 Multiple Extension Languages
=================================

The Guile and Python extension languages do not share any state, and
generally do not interfere with each other.  There are some things to be
aware of, however.

23.5.1 Python comes first
-------------------------

Python was GDB's first extension language, and to avoid breaking
existing behaviour Python comes first.  This is generally solved by the
"first one wins" principle.  GDB maintains a list of enabled extension
languages, and when it makes a call to an extension language, (say to
pretty-print a value), it tries each in turn until an extension language
indicates it has performed the request (e.g., has returned the
pretty-printed form of a value).  This extends to errors while
performing such requests: If an error happens while, for example, trying
to pretty-print an object then the error is reported and any following
extension languages are not tried.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Aliases,  Prev: Multiple Extension Languages,  Up: Extending GDB

23.6 Creating new spellings of existing commands
================================================

It is often useful to define alternate spellings of existing commands.
For example, if a new GDB command defined in Python has a long name to
type, it is handy to have an abbreviated version of it that involves
less typing.

   GDB itself uses aliases.  For example 's' is an alias of the 'step'
command even though it is otherwise an ambiguous abbreviation of other
commands like 'set' and 'show'.

   Aliases are also used to provide shortened or more common versions of
multi-word commands.  For example, GDB provides the 'tty' alias of the
'set inferior-tty' command.

   You can define a new alias with the 'alias' command.

'alias [-a] [--] ALIAS = COMMAND'

   ALIAS specifies the name of the new alias.  Each word of ALIAS must
consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.

   COMMAND specifies the name of an existing command that is being
aliased.

   The '-a' option specifies that the new alias is an abbreviation of
the command.  Abbreviations are not shown in command lists displayed by
the 'help' command.

   The '--' option specifies the end of options, and is useful when
ALIAS begins with a dash.

   Here is a simple example showing how to make an abbreviation of a
command so that there is less to type.  Suppose you were tired of typing
'disas', the current shortest unambiguous abbreviation of the
'disassemble' command and you wanted an even shorter version named 'di'.
The following will accomplish this.

     (gdb) alias -a di = disas

   Note that aliases are different from user-defined commands.  With a
user-defined command, you also need to write documentation for it with
the 'document' command.  An alias automatically picks up the
documentation of the existing command.

   Here is an example where we make 'elms' an abbreviation of 'elements'
in the 'set print elements' command.  This is to show that you can make
an abbreviation of any part of a command.

     (gdb) alias -a set print elms = set print elements
     (gdb) alias -a show print elms = show print elements
     (gdb) set p elms 20
     (gdb) show p elms
     Limit on string chars or array elements to print is 200.

   Note that if you are defining an alias of a 'set' command, and you
want to have an alias for the corresponding 'show' command, then you
need to define the latter separately.

   Unambiguously abbreviated commands are allowed in COMMAND and ALIAS,
just as they are normally.

     (gdb) alias -a set pr elms = set p ele

   Finally, here is an example showing the creation of a one word alias
for a more complex command.  This creates alias 'spe' of the command
'set print elements'.

     (gdb) alias spe = set print elements
     (gdb) spe 20

24 Command Interpreters
***********************

GDB supports multiple command interpreters, and some command
infrastructure to allow users or user interface writers to switch
between interpreters or run commands in other interpreters.

   GDB currently supports two command interpreters, the console
interpreter (sometimes called the command-line interpreter or CLI) and
the machine interface interpreter (or GDB/MI).  This manual describes
both of these interfaces in great detail.

   By default, GDB will start with the console interpreter.  However,
the user may choose to start GDB with another interpreter by specifying
the '-i' or '--interpreter' startup options.  Defined interpreters
include:

'console'
     The traditional console or command-line interpreter.  This is the
     most often used interpreter with GDB.  With no interpreter
     specified at runtime, GDB will use this interpreter.

'mi'
     The newest GDB/MI interface (currently 'mi2').  Used primarily by
     programs wishing to use GDB as a backend for a debugger GUI or an
     IDE. For more information, see *note The GDB/MI Interface: GDB/MI.

'mi2'
     The current GDB/MI interface.

'mi1'
     The GDB/MI interface included in GDB 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

   The interpreter being used by GDB may not be dynamically switched at
runtime.  Although possible, this could lead to a very precarious
situation.  Consider an IDE using GDB/MI.  If a user enters the command
"interpreter-set console" in a console view, GDB would switch to using
the console interpreter, rendering the IDE inoperable!

   Although you may only choose a single interpreter at startup, you may
execute commands in any interpreter from the current interpreter using
the appropriate command.  If you are running the console interpreter,
simply use the 'interpreter-exec' command:

     interpreter-exec mi "-data-list-register-names"

   GDB/MI has a similar command, although it is only available in
versions of GDB which support GDB/MI version 2 (or greater).

25 GDB Text User Interface
**************************

* Menu:

* TUI Overview::                TUI overview
* TUI Keys::                    TUI key bindings
* TUI Single Key Mode::         TUI single key mode
* TUI Commands::                TUI-specific commands
* TUI Configuration::           TUI configuration variables

The GDB Text User Interface (TUI) is a terminal interface which uses the
'curses' library to show the source file, the assembly output, the
program registers and GDB commands in separate text windows.  The TUI
mode is supported only on platforms where a suitable version of the
'curses' library is available.

   The TUI mode is enabled by default when you invoke GDB as 'gdb -tui'.
You can also switch in and out of TUI mode while GDB runs by using
various TUI commands and key bindings, such as 'C-x C-a'.  *Note TUI Key
Bindings: TUI Keys.


File: gdb.info,  Node: TUI Overview,  Next: TUI Keys,  Up: TUI

25.1 TUI Overview
=================

In TUI mode, GDB can display several text windows:

_command_
     This window is the GDB command window with the GDB prompt and the
     GDB output.  The GDB input is still managed using readline.

_source_
     The source window shows the source file of the program.  The
     current line and active breakpoints are displayed in this window.

_assembly_
     The assembly window shows the disassembly output of the program.

_register_
     This window shows the processor registers.  Registers are
     highlighted when their values change.

   The source and assembly windows show the current program position by
highlighting the current line and marking it with a '>' marker.
Breakpoints are indicated with two markers.  The first marker indicates
the breakpoint type:

'B'
     Breakpoint which was hit at least once.

'b'
     Breakpoint which was never hit.

'H'
     Hardware breakpoint which was hit at least once.

'h'
     Hardware breakpoint which was never hit.

   The second marker indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled or not:

'+'
     Breakpoint is enabled.

'-'
     Breakpoint is disabled.

   The source, assembly and register windows are updated when the
current thread changes, when the frame changes, or when the program
counter changes.

   These windows are not all visible at the same time.  The command
window is always visible.  The others can be arranged in several
layouts:

   * source only,

   * assembly only,

   * source and assembly,

   * source and registers, or

   * assembly and registers.

   A status line above the command window shows the following
information:

_target_
     Indicates the current GDB target.  (*note Specifying a Debugging
     Target: Targets.).

_process_
     Gives the current process or thread number.  When no process is
     being debugged, this field is set to 'No process'.

_function_
     Gives the current function name for the selected frame.  The name
     is demangled if demangling is turned on (*note Print Settings::).
     When there is no symbol corresponding to the current program
     counter, the string '??' is displayed.

_line_
     Indicates the current line number for the selected frame.  When the
     current line number is not known, the string '??' is displayed.

_pc_
     Indicates the current program counter address.

25.2 TUI Key Bindings
=====================

The TUI installs several key bindings in the readline keymaps (*note
Command Line Editing::).  The following key bindings are installed for
both TUI mode and the GDB standard mode.

'C-x C-a'
'C-x a'
'C-x A'
     Enter or leave the TUI mode.  When leaving the TUI mode, the curses
     window management stops and GDB operates using its standard mode,
     writing on the terminal directly.  When reentering the TUI mode,
     control is given back to the curses windows.  The screen is then
     refreshed.

'C-x 1'
     Use a TUI layout with only one window.  The layout will either be
     'source' or 'assembly'.  When the TUI mode is not active, it will
     switch to the TUI mode.

     Think of this key binding as the Emacs 'C-x 1' binding.

'C-x 2'
     Use a TUI layout with at least two windows.  When the current
     layout already has two windows, the next layout with two windows is
     used.  When a new layout is chosen, one window will always be
     common to the previous layout and the new one.

     Think of it as the Emacs 'C-x 2' binding.

'C-x o'
     Change the active window.  The TUI associates several key bindings
     (like scrolling and arrow keys) with the active window.  This
     command gives the focus to the next TUI window.

     Think of it as the Emacs 'C-x o' binding.

'C-x s'
     Switch in and out of the TUI SingleKey mode that binds single keys
     to GDB commands (*note TUI Single Key Mode::).

   The following key bindings only work in the TUI mode:

<PgUp>
     Scroll the active window one page up.

<PgDn>
     Scroll the active window one page down.

<Up>
     Scroll the active window one line up.

<Down>
     Scroll the active window one line down.

<Left>
     Scroll the active window one column left.

<Right>
     Scroll the active window one column right.

'C-L'
     Refresh the screen.

   Because the arrow keys scroll the active window in the TUI mode, they
are not available for their normal use by readline unless the command
window has the focus.  When another window is active, you must use other
readline key bindings such as 'C-p', 'C-n', 'C-b' and 'C-f' to control
the command window.


File: gdb.info,  Node: TUI Single Key Mode,  Next: TUI Commands,  Prev: TUI Keys,  Up: TUI

25.3 TUI Single Key Mode
========================

The TUI also provides a "SingleKey" mode, which binds several frequently
used GDB commands to single keys.  Type 'C-x s' to switch into this
mode, where the following key bindings are used:

'c'
     continue

'd'
     down

'f'
     finish

'n'
     next

'q'
     exit the SingleKey mode.

'r'
     run

's'
     step

'u'
     up

'v'
     info locals

'w'
     where

   Other keys temporarily switch to the GDB command prompt.  The key
that was pressed is inserted in the editing buffer so that it is
possible to type most GDB commands without interaction with the TUI
SingleKey mode.  Once the command is entered the TUI SingleKey mode is
restored.  The only way to permanently leave this mode is by typing 'q'
or 'C-x s'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: TUI Commands,  Next: TUI Configuration,  Prev: TUI Single Key Mode,  Up: TUI

25.4 TUI-specific Commands
==========================

The TUI has specific commands to control the text windows.  These
commands are always available, even when GDB is not in the TUI mode.
When GDB is in the standard mode, most of these commands will
automatically switch to the TUI mode.

   Note that if GDB's 'stdout' is not connected to a terminal, or GDB
has been started with the machine interface interpreter (*note The
GDB/MI Interface: GDB/MI.), most of these commands will fail with an
error, because it would not be possible or desirable to enable curses
window management.

'info win'
     List and give the size of all displayed windows.

'layout next'
     Display the next layout.

'layout prev'
     Display the previous layout.

'layout src'
     Display the source window only.

'layout asm'
     Display the assembly window only.

'layout split'
     Display the source and assembly window.

'layout regs'
     Display the register window together with the source or assembly
     window.

'focus next'
     Make the next window active for scrolling.

'focus prev'
     Make the previous window active for scrolling.

'focus src'
     Make the source window active for scrolling.

'focus asm'
     Make the assembly window active for scrolling.

'focus regs'
     Make the register window active for scrolling.

'focus cmd'
     Make the command window active for scrolling.

'refresh'
     Refresh the screen.  This is similar to typing 'C-L'.

'tui reg float'
     Show the floating point registers in the register window.

'tui reg general'
     Show the general registers in the register window.

'tui reg next'
     Show the next register group.  The list of register groups as well
     as their order is target specific.  The predefined register groups
     are the following: 'general', 'float', 'system', 'vector', 'all',
     'save', 'restore'.

'tui reg system'
     Show the system registers in the register window.

'update'
     Update the source window and the current execution point.

'winheight NAME +COUNT'
'winheight NAME -COUNT'
     Change the height of the window NAME by COUNT lines.  Positive
     counts increase the height, while negative counts decrease it.

'tabset NCHARS'
     Set the width of tab stops to be NCHARS characters.

25.5 TUI Configuration Variables
================================

Several configuration variables control the appearance of TUI windows.

'set tui border-kind KIND'
     Select the border appearance for the source, assembly and register
     windows.  The possible values are the following:
     'space'
          Use a space character to draw the border.

     'ascii'
          Use ASCII characters '+', '-' and '|' to draw the border.

     'acs'
          Use the Alternate Character Set to draw the border.  The
          border is drawn using character line graphics if the terminal
          supports them.

'set tui border-mode MODE'
'set tui active-border-mode MODE'
     Select the display attributes for the borders of the inactive
     windows or the active window.  The MODE can be one of the
     following:
     'normal'
          Use normal attributes to display the border.

     'standout'
          Use standout mode.

     'reverse'
          Use reverse video mode.

     'half'
          Use half bright mode.

     'half-standout'
          Use half bright and standout mode.

     'bold'
          Use extra bright or bold mode.

     'bold-standout'
          Use extra bright or bold and standout mode.

26 Using GDB under GNU Emacs
****************************

A special interface allows you to use GNU Emacs to view (and edit) the
source files for the program you are debugging with GDB.

   To use this interface, use the command 'M-x gdb' in Emacs.  Give the
executable file you want to debug as an argument.  This command starts
GDB as a subprocess of Emacs, with input and output through a newly
created Emacs buffer.

   Running GDB under Emacs can be just like running GDB normally except
for two things:

   * All "terminal" input and output goes through an Emacs buffer,
     called the GUD buffer.

     This applies both to GDB commands and their output, and to the
     input and output done by the program you are debugging.

     This is useful because it means that you can copy the text of
     previous commands and input them again; you can even use parts of
     the output in this way.

     All the facilities of Emacs' Shell mode are available for
     interacting with your program.  In particular, you can send signals
     the usual way--for example, 'C-c C-c' for an interrupt, 'C-c C-z'
     for a stop.

   * GDB displays source code through Emacs.

     Each time GDB displays a stack frame, Emacs automatically finds the
     source file for that frame and puts an arrow ('=>') at the left
     margin of the current line.  Emacs uses a separate buffer for
     source display, and splits the screen to show both your GDB session
     and the source.

     Explicit GDB 'list' or search commands still produce output as
     usual, but you probably have no reason to use them from Emacs.

   We call this "text command mode".  Emacs 22.1, and later, also uses a
graphical mode, enabled by default, which provides further buffers that
can control the execution and describe the state of your program.  *Note
(Emacs)GDB Graphical Interface::.

   If you specify an absolute file name when prompted for the 'M-x gdb'
argument, then Emacs sets your current working directory to where your
program resides.  If you only specify the file name, then Emacs sets
your current working directory to the directory associated with the
previous buffer.  In this case, GDB may find your program by searching
your environment's 'PATH' variable, but on some operating systems it
might not find the source.  So, although the GDB input and output
session proceeds normally, the auxiliary buffer does not display the
current source and line of execution.

   The initial working directory of GDB is printed on the top line of
the GUD buffer and this serves as a default for the commands that
specify files for GDB to operate on.  *Note Commands to Specify Files:
Files.

   By default, 'M-x gdb' calls the program called 'gdb'.  If you need to
call GDB by a different name (for example, if you keep several
configurations around, with different names) you can customize the Emacs
variable 'gud-gdb-command-name' to run the one you want.

   In the GUD buffer, you can use these special Emacs commands in
addition to the standard Shell mode commands:

'C-h m'
     Describe the features of Emacs' GUD Mode.

'C-c C-s'
     Execute to another source line, like the GDB 'step' command; also
     update the display window to show the current file and location.

'C-c C-n'
     Execute to next source line in this function, skipping all function
     calls, like the GDB 'next' command.  Then update the display window
     to show the current file and location.

'C-c C-i'
     Execute one instruction, like the GDB 'stepi' command; update
     display window accordingly.

'C-c C-f'
     Execute until exit from the selected stack frame, like the GDB
     'finish' command.

'C-c C-r'
     Continue execution of your program, like the GDB 'continue'
     command.

'C-c <'
     Go up the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument (*note
     Numeric Arguments: (Emacs)Arguments.), like the GDB 'up' command.

'C-c >'
     Go down the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument,
     like the GDB 'down' command.

   In any source file, the Emacs command 'C-x <SPC>' ('gud-break') tells
GDB to set a breakpoint on the source line point is on.

   In text command mode, if you type 'M-x speedbar', Emacs displays a
separate frame which shows a backtrace when the GUD buffer is current.
Move point to any frame in the stack and type <RET> to make it become
the current frame and display the associated source in the source
buffer.  Alternatively, click 'Mouse-2' to make the selected frame
become the current one.  In graphical mode, the speedbar displays watch
expressions.

   If you accidentally delete the source-display buffer, an easy way to
get it back is to type the command 'f' in the GDB buffer, to request a
frame display; when you run under Emacs, this recreates the source
buffer if necessary to show you the context of the current frame.

   The source files displayed in Emacs are in ordinary Emacs buffers
which are visiting the source files in the usual way.  You can edit the
files with these buffers if you wish; but keep in mind that GDB
communicates with Emacs in terms of line numbers.  If you add or delete
lines from the text, the line numbers that GDB knows cease to correspond
properly with the code.

   A more detailed description of Emacs' interaction with GDB is given
in the Emacs manual (*note (Emacs)Debuggers::).

27 The GDB/MI Interface
***********************

Function and Purpose
====================

GDB/MI is a line based machine oriented text interface to GDB and is
activated by specifying using the '--interpreter' command line option
(*note Mode Options::).  It is specifically intended to support the
development of systems which use the debugger as just one small
component of a larger system.

   This chapter is a specification of the GDB/MI interface.  It is
written in the form of a reference manual.

   Note that GDB/MI is still under construction, so some of the features
described below are incomplete and subject to change (*note GDB/MI
Development and Front Ends: GDB/MI Development and Front Ends.).

Notation and Terminology
========================

This chapter uses the following notation:

   * '|' separates two alternatives.

   * '[ SOMETHING ]' indicates that SOMETHING is optional: it may or may
     not be given.

   * '( GROUP )*' means that GROUP inside the parentheses may repeat
     zero or more times.

   * '( GROUP )+' means that GROUP inside the parentheses may repeat one
     or more times.

   * '"STRING"' means a literal STRING.

27.1 GDB/MI General Design
==========================

Interaction of a GDB/MI frontend with GDB involves three parts--commands
sent to GDB, responses to those commands and notifications.  Each
command results in exactly one response, indicating either successful
completion of the command, or an error.  For the commands that do not
resume the target, the response contains the requested information.  For
the commands that resume the target, the response only indicates whether
the target was successfully resumed.  Notifications is the mechanism for
reporting changes in the state of the target, or in GDB state, that
cannot conveniently be associated with a command and reported as part of
that command response.

   The important examples of notifications are:

   * Exec notifications.  These are used to report changes in target
     state--when a target is resumed, or stopped.  It would not be
     feasible to include this information in response of resuming
     commands, because one resume commands can result in multiple events
     in different threads.  Also, quite some time may pass before any
     event happens in the target, while a frontend needs to know whether
     the resuming command itself was successfully executed.

   * Console output, and status notifications.  Console output
     notifications are used to report output of CLI commands, as well as
     diagnostics for other commands.  Status notifications are used to
     report the progress of a long-running operation.  Naturally,
     including this information in command response would mean no output
     is produced until the command is finished, which is undesirable.

   * General notifications.  Commands may have various side effects on
     the GDB or target state beyond their official purpose.  For
     example, a command may change the selected thread.  Although such
     changes can be included in command response, using notification
     allows for more orthogonal frontend design.

   There's no guarantee that whenever an MI command reports an error,
GDB or the target are in any specific state, and especially, the state
is not reverted to the state before the MI command was processed.
Therefore, whenever an MI command results in an error, we recommend that
the frontend refreshes all the information shown in the user interface.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Context management,  Next: Asynchronous and non-stop modes,  Up: GDB/MI General Design

27.1.1 Context management
-------------------------

27.1.1.1 Threads and Frames
...........................

In most cases when GDB accesses the target, this access is done in
context of a specific thread and frame (*note Frames::).  Often, even
when accessing global data, the target requires that a thread be
specified.  The CLI interface maintains the selected thread and frame,
and supplies them to target on each command.  This is convenient,
because a command line user would not want to specify that information
explicitly on each command, and because user interacts with GDB via a
single terminal, so no confusion is possible as to what thread and frame
are the current ones.

   In the case of MI, the concept of selected thread and frame is less
useful.  First, a frontend can easily remember this information itself.
Second, a graphical frontend can have more than one window, each one
used for debugging a different thread, and the frontend might want to
access additional threads for internal purposes.  This increases the
risk that by relying on implicitly selected thread, the frontend may be
operating on a wrong one.  Therefore, each MI command should explicitly
specify which thread and frame to operate on.  To make it possible, each
MI command accepts the '--thread' and '--frame' options, the value to
each is GDB identifier for thread and frame to operate on.

   Usually, each top-level window in a frontend allows the user to
select a thread and a frame, and remembers the user selection for
further operations.  However, in some cases GDB may suggest that the
current thread be changed.  For example, when stopping on a breakpoint
it is reasonable to switch to the thread where breakpoint is hit.  For
another example, if the user issues the CLI 'thread' command via the
frontend, it is desirable to change the frontend's selected thread to
the one specified by user.  GDB communicates the suggestion to change
current thread using the '=thread-selected' notification.  No such
notification is available for the selected frame at the moment.

   Note that historically, MI shares the selected thread with CLI, so
frontends used the '-thread-select' to execute commands in the right
context.  However, getting this to work right is cumbersome.  The
simplest way is for frontend to emit '-thread-select' command before
every command.  This doubles the number of commands that need to be
sent.  The alternative approach is to suppress '-thread-select' if the
selected thread in GDB is supposed to be identical to the thread the
frontend wants to operate on.  However, getting this optimization right
can be tricky.  In particular, if the frontend sends several commands to
GDB, and one of the commands changes the selected thread, then the
behaviour of subsequent commands will change.  So, a frontend should
either wait for response from such problematic commands, or explicitly
add '-thread-select' for all subsequent commands.  No frontend is known
to do this exactly right, so it is suggested to just always pass the
'--thread' and '--frame' options.

27.1.1.2 Language
.................

The execution of several commands depends on which language is selected.
By default, the current language (*note show language::) is used.  But
for commands known to be language-sensitive, it is recommended to use
the '--language' option.  This option takes one argument, which is the
name of the language to use while executing the command.  For instance:

     -data-evaluate-expression --language c "sizeof (void*)"
     ^done,value="4"
     (gdb)

   The valid language names are the same names accepted by the 'set
language' command (*note Manually::), excluding 'auto', 'local' or
'unknown'.

27.1.2 Asynchronous command execution and non-stop mode
-------------------------------------------------------

On some targets, GDB is capable of processing MI commands even while the
target is running.  This is called "asynchronous command execution"
(*note Background Execution::).  The frontend may specify a preferrence
for asynchronous execution using the '-gdb-set mi-async 1' command,
which should be emitted before either running the executable or
attaching to the target.  After the frontend has started the executable
or attached to the target, it can find if asynchronous execution is
enabled using the '-list-target-features' command.

'-gdb-set mi-async on'
'-gdb-set mi-async off'
     Set whether MI is in asynchronous mode.

     When 'off', which is the default, MI execution commands (e.g.,
     '-exec-continue') are foreground commands, and GDB waits for the
     program to stop before processing further commands.

     When 'on', MI execution commands are background execution commands
     (e.g., '-exec-continue' becomes the equivalent of the 'c&' CLI
     command), and so GDB is capable of processing MI commands even
     while the target is running.

'-gdb-show mi-async'
     Show whether MI asynchronous mode is enabled.

   Note: In GDB version 7.7 and earlier, this option was called
'target-async' instead of 'mi-async', and it had the effect of both
putting MI in asynchronous mode and making CLI background commands
possible.  CLI background commands are now always possible "out of the
box" if the target supports them.  The old spelling is kept as a
deprecated alias for backwards compatibility.

   Even if GDB can accept a command while target is running, many
commands that access the target do not work when the target is running.
Therefore, asynchronous command execution is most useful when combined
with non-stop mode (*note Non-Stop Mode::).  Then, it is possible to
examine the state of one thread, while other threads are running.

   When a given thread is running, MI commands that try to access the
target in the context of that thread may not work, or may work only on
some targets.  In particular, commands that try to operate on thread's
stack will not work, on any target.  Commands that read memory, or
modify breakpoints, may work or not work, depending on the target.  Note
that even commands that operate on global state, such as 'print', 'set',
and breakpoint commands, still access the target in the context of a
specific thread, so frontend should try to find a stopped thread and
perform the operation on that thread (using the '--thread' option).

   Which commands will work in the context of a running thread is highly
target dependent.  However, the two commands '-exec-interrupt', to stop
a thread, and '-thread-info', to find the state of a thread, will always
work.

27.1.3 Thread groups
--------------------

GDB may be used to debug several processes at the same time.  On some
platfroms, GDB may support debugging of several hardware systems, each
one having several cores with several different processes running on
each core.  This section describes the MI mechanism to support such
debugging scenarios.

   The key observation is that regardless of the structure of the
target, MI can have a global list of threads, because most commands that
accept the '--thread' option do not need to know what process that
thread belongs to.  Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce neither
additional '--process' option, nor an notion of the current process in
the MI interface.  The only strictly new feature that is required is the
ability to find how the threads are grouped into processes.

   To allow the user to discover such grouping, and to support arbitrary
hierarchy of machines/cores/processes, MI introduces the concept of a
"thread group".  Thread group is a collection of threads and other
thread groups.  A thread group always has a string identifier, a type,
and may have additional attributes specific to the type.  A new command,
'-list-thread-groups', returns the list of top-level thread groups,
which correspond to processes that GDB is debugging at the moment.  By
passing an identifier of a thread group to the '-list-thread-groups'
command, it is possible to obtain the members of specific thread group.

   To allow the user to easily discover processes, and other objects, he
wishes to debug, a concept of "available thread group" is introduced.
Available thread group is an thread group that GDB is not debugging, but
that can be attached to, using the '-target-attach' command.  The list
of available top-level thread groups can be obtained using
'-list-thread-groups --available'.  In general, the content of a thread
group may be only retrieved only after attaching to that thread group.

   Thread groups are related to inferiors (*note Inferiors and
Programs::).  Each inferior corresponds to a thread group of a special
type 'process', and some additional operations are permitted on such
thread groups.

Notes:

   * The CLI commands are still handled by the MI interpreter; their
     output is described below.

   * The 'TOKEN', when present, is passed back when the command
     finishes.

   * Some MI commands accept optional arguments as part of the parameter
     list.  Each option is identified by a leading '-' (dash) and may be
     followed by an optional argument parameter.  Options occur first in
     the parameter list and can be delimited from normal parameters
     using '--' (this is useful when some parameters begin with a dash).

   Pragmatics:

   * We want easy access to the existing CLI syntax (for debugging).

   * We want it to be easy to spot a MI operation.

followed, optionally, by a single result record.  This result record is
for the most recent command.  The sequence of output records is
terminated by '(gdb)'.

   If an input command was prefixed with a 'TOKEN' then the

Notes:

   * All output sequences end in a single line containing a period.

   * The 'TOKEN' is from the corresponding request.  Note that for all
     async output, while the token is allowed by the grammar and may be
     output by future versions of GDB for select async output messages,
     it is generally omitted.  Frontends should treat all async output
     as reporting general changes in the state of the target and there
     should be no need to associate async output to any prior command.

   * STATUS-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains on-going status information about the
     progress of a slow operation.  It can be discarded.  All status
     output is prefixed by '+'.

   * EXEC-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains asynchronous state change on the target
     (stopped, started, disappeared).  All async output is prefixed by
     '*'.

   * NOTIFY-ASYNC-OUTPUT contains supplementary information that the
     client should handle (e.g., a new breakpoint information).  All
     notify output is prefixed by '='.

   * CONSOLE-STREAM-OUTPUT is output that should be displayed as is in
     the console.  It is the textual response to a CLI command.  All the
     console output is prefixed by '~'.

   * TARGET-STREAM-OUTPUT is the output produced by the target program.
     All the target output is prefixed by '@'.

   * LOG-STREAM-OUTPUT is output text coming from GDB's internals, for
     instance messages that should be displayed as part of an error log.
     All the log output is prefixed by '&'.

   * New GDB/MI commands should only output LISTS containing VALUES.

27.3 GDB/MI Compatibility with CLI
==================================

For the developers convenience CLI commands can be entered directly, but
there may be some unexpected behaviour.  For example, commands that
query the user will behave as if the user replied yes, breakpoint
command lists are not executed and some CLI commands, such as 'if',
'when' and 'define', prompt for further input with '>', which is not
valid MI output.

   This feature may be removed at some stage in the future and it is
recommended that front ends use the '-interpreter-exec' command (*note
-interpreter-exec::).

27.4 GDB/MI Development and Front Ends
======================================

The application which takes the MI output and presents the state of the
program being debugged to the user is called a "front end".

   Although GDB/MI is still incomplete, it is currently being used by a
variety of front ends to GDB.  This makes it difficult to introduce new
functionality without breaking existing usage.  This section tries to
minimize the problems by describing how the protocol might change.

   Some changes in MI need not break a carefully designed front end, and
for these the MI version will remain unchanged.  The following is a list
of changes that may occur within one level, so front ends should parse
MI output in a way that can handle them:

   * New MI commands may be added.

   * New fields may be added to the output of any MI command.

   * The range of values for fields with specified values, e.g.,
     'in_scope' (*note -var-update::) may be extended.

   If the changes are likely to break front ends, the MI version level
will be increased by one.  This will allow the front end to parse the
output according to the MI version.  Apart from mi0, new versions of GDB
will not support old versions of MI and it will be the responsibility of
the front end to work with the new one.

   The best way to avoid unexpected changes in MI that might break your
front end is to make your project known to GDB developers and follow
development on <gdb@sourceware.org> and <gdb-patches@sourceware.org>.

27.5.1 GDB/MI Result Records
----------------------------

In addition to a number of out-of-band notifications, the response to a
GDB/MI command includes one of the following result indications:

'"^done" [ "," RESULTS ]'
     The synchronous operation was successful, 'RESULTS' are the return
     values.

'"^running"'
     This result record is equivalent to '^done'.  Historically, it was
     output instead of '^done' if the command has resumed the target.
     This behaviour is maintained for backward compatibility, but all
     frontends should treat '^done' and '^running' identically and rely
     on the '*running' output record to determine which threads are
     resumed.

'"^connected"'
     GDB has connected to a remote target.

'"^error" "," "msg=" C-STRING [ "," "code=" C-STRING ]'
     The operation failed.  The 'msg=C-STRING' variable contains the
     corresponding error message.

     If present, the 'code=C-STRING' variable provides an error code on
     which consumers can rely on to detect the corresponding error
     condition.  At present, only one error code is defined:

     '"undefined-command"'
          Indicates that the command causing the error does not exist.

'"^exit"'
     GDB has terminated.

27.5.2 GDB/MI Stream Records
----------------------------

GDB internally maintains a number of output streams: the console, the
target, and the log.  The output intended for each of these streams is
funneled through the GDB/MI interface using "stream records".

   Each stream record begins with a unique "prefix character" which
identifies its stream (*note GDB/MI Output Syntax: GDB/MI Output
Syntax.).  In addition to the prefix, each stream record contains a
'STRING-OUTPUT'.  This is either raw text (with an implicit new line) or
a quoted C string (which does not contain an implicit newline).

'"~" STRING-OUTPUT'
     The console output stream contains text that should be displayed in
     the CLI console window.  It contains the textual responses to CLI
     commands.

'"@" STRING-OUTPUT'
     The target output stream contains any textual output from the
     running target.  This is only present when GDB's event loop is
     truly asynchronous, which is currently only the case for remote
     targets.

'"&" STRING-OUTPUT'
     The log stream contains debugging messages being produced by GDB's
     internals.

27.5.3 GDB/MI Async Records
---------------------------

"Async" records are used to notify the GDB/MI client of additional
changes that have occurred.  Those changes can either be a consequence
of GDB/MI commands (e.g., a breakpoint modified) or a result of target
activity (e.g., target stopped).

   The following is the list of possible async records:

'*running,thread-id="THREAD"'
     The target is now running.  The THREAD field tells which specific
     thread is now running, and can be 'all' if all threads are running.
     The frontend should assume that no interaction with a running
     thread is possible after this notification is produced.  The
     frontend should not assume that this notification is output only
     once for any command.  GDB may emit this notification several
     times, either for different threads, because it cannot resume all
     threads together, or even for a single thread, if the thread must
     be stepped though some code before letting it run freely.

'*stopped,reason="REASON",thread-id="ID",stopped-threads="STOPPED",core="CORE"'
     The target has stopped.  The REASON field can have one of the
     following values:

     'breakpoint-hit'
          A breakpoint was reached.
     'watchpoint-trigger'
          A watchpoint was triggered.
     'read-watchpoint-trigger'
          A read watchpoint was triggered.
     'access-watchpoint-trigger'
          An access watchpoint was triggered.
     'function-finished'
          An -exec-finish or similar CLI command was accomplished.
     'location-reached'
          An -exec-until or similar CLI command was accomplished.
     'watchpoint-scope'
          A watchpoint has gone out of scope.
     'end-stepping-range'
          An -exec-next, -exec-next-instruction, -exec-step,
          -exec-step-instruction or similar CLI command was
          accomplished.
     'exited-signalled'
          The inferior exited because of a signal.
     'exited'
          The inferior exited.
     'exited-normally'
          The inferior exited normally.
     'signal-received'
          A signal was received by the inferior.
     'solib-event'
          The inferior has stopped due to a library being loaded or
          unloaded.  This can happen when 'stop-on-solib-events' (*note
          Files::) is set or when a 'catch load' or 'catch unload'
          catchpoint is in use (*note Set Catchpoints::).
     'fork'
          The inferior has forked.  This is reported when 'catch fork'
          (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'vfork'
          The inferior has vforked.  This is reported in when 'catch
          vfork' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'syscall-entry'
          The inferior entered a system call.  This is reported when
          'catch syscall' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'syscall-entry'
          The inferior returned from a system call.  This is reported
          when 'catch syscall' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.
     'exec'
          The inferior called 'exec'.  This is reported when 'catch
          exec' (*note Set Catchpoints::) has been used.

     The ID field identifies the thread that directly caused the stop -
     for example by hitting a breakpoint.  Depending on whether all-stop
     mode is in effect (*note All-Stop Mode::), GDB may either stop all
     threads, or only the thread that directly triggered the stop.  If
     all threads are stopped, the STOPPED field will have the value of
     '"all"'.  Otherwise, the value of the STOPPED field will be a list
     of thread identifiers.  Presently, this list will always include a
     single thread, but frontend should be prepared to see several
     threads in the list.  The CORE field reports the processor core on
     which the stop event has happened.  This field may be absent if
     such information is not available.

'=thread-group-added,id="ID"'
'=thread-group-removed,id="ID"'
     A thread group was either added or removed.  The ID field contains
     the GDB identifier of the thread group.  When a thread group is
     added, it generally might not be associated with a running process.
     When a thread group is removed, its id becomes invalid and cannot
     be used in any way.

'=thread-group-started,id="ID",pid="PID"'
     A thread group became associated with a running program, either
     because the program was just started or the thread group was
     attached to a program.  The ID field contains the GDB identifier of
     the thread group.  The PID field contains process identifier,
     specific to the operating system.

'=thread-group-exited,id="ID"[,exit-code="CODE"]'
     A thread group is no longer associated with a running program,
     either because the program has exited, or because it was detached
     from.  The ID field contains the GDB identifier of the thread
     group.  The CODE field is the exit code of the inferior; it exists
     only when the inferior exited with some code.

'=thread-created,id="ID",group-id="GID"'
'=thread-exited,id="ID",group-id="GID"'
     A thread either was created, or has exited.  The ID field contains
     the GDB identifier of the thread.  The GID field identifies the
     thread group this thread belongs to.

'=thread-selected,id="ID"'
     Informs that the selected thread was changed as result of the last
     command.  This notification is not emitted as result of
     '-thread-select' command but is emitted whenever an MI command that
     is not documented to change the selected thread actually changes
     it.  In particular, invoking, directly or indirectly (via
     user-defined command), the CLI 'thread' command, will generate this
     notification.

     We suggest that in response to this notification, front ends
     highlight the selected thread and cause subsequent commands to
     apply to that thread.

'=library-loaded,...'
     Reports that a new library file was loaded by the program.  This
     notification has 4 fields--ID, TARGET-NAME, HOST-NAME, and
     SYMBOLS-LOADED.  The ID field is an opaque identifier of the
     library.  For remote debugging case, TARGET-NAME and HOST-NAME
     fields give the name of the library file on the target, and on the
     host respectively.  For native debugging, both those fields have
     the same value.  The SYMBOLS-LOADED field is emitted only for
     backward compatibility and should not be relied on to convey any
     useful information.  The THREAD-GROUP field, if present, specifies
     the id of the thread group in whose context the library was loaded.
     If the field is absent, it means the library was loaded in the
     context of all present thread groups.

'=library-unloaded,...'
     Reports that a library was unloaded by the program.  This
     notification has 3 fields--ID, TARGET-NAME and HOST-NAME with the
     same meaning as for the '=library-loaded' notification.  The
     THREAD-GROUP field, if present, specifies the id of the thread
     group in whose context the library was unloaded.  If the field is
     absent, it means the library was unloaded in the context of all
     present thread groups.

'=traceframe-changed,num=TFNUM,tracepoint=TPNUM'
'=traceframe-changed,end'
     Reports that the trace frame was changed and its new number is
     TFNUM.  The number of the tracepoint associated with this trace
     frame is TPNUM.

'=tsv-created,name=NAME,initial=INITIAL'
     Reports that the new trace state variable NAME is created with
     initial value INITIAL.

'=tsv-deleted,name=NAME'
'=tsv-deleted'
     Reports that the trace state variable NAME is deleted or all trace
     state variables are deleted.

'=tsv-modified,name=NAME,initial=INITIAL[,current=CURRENT]'
     Reports that the trace state variable NAME is modified with the
     initial value INITIAL.  The current value CURRENT of trace state
     variable is optional and is reported if the current value of trace
     state variable is known.

'=breakpoint-created,bkpt={...}'
'=breakpoint-modified,bkpt={...}'
'=breakpoint-deleted,id=NUMBER'
     Reports that a breakpoint was created, modified, or deleted,
     respectively.  Only user-visible breakpoints are reported to the MI
     user.

     The BKPT argument is of the same form as returned by the various
     breakpoint commands; *Note GDB/MI Breakpoint Commands::.  The
     NUMBER is the ordinal number of the breakpoint.

     Note that if a breakpoint is emitted in the result record of a
     command, then it will not also be emitted in an async record.

'=record-started,thread-group="ID"'
'=record-stopped,thread-group="ID"'
     Execution log recording was either started or stopped on an
     inferior.  The ID is the GDB identifier of the thread group
     corresponding to the affected inferior.

'=cmd-param-changed,param=PARAM,value=VALUE'
     Reports that a parameter of the command 'set PARAM' is changed to
     VALUE.  In the multi-word 'set' command, the PARAM is the whole
     parameter list to 'set' command.  For example, In command 'set
     check type on', PARAM is 'check type' and VALUE is 'on'.

'=memory-changed,thread-group=ID,addr=ADDR,len=LEN[,type="code"]'
     Reports that bytes from ADDR to DATA + LEN were written in an
     inferior.  The ID is the identifier of the thread group
     corresponding to the affected inferior.  The optional 'type="code"'
     part is reported if the memory written to holds executable code.

27.5.4 GDB/MI Breakpoint Information
------------------------------------

When GDB reports information about a breakpoint, a tracepoint, a
watchpoint, or a catchpoint, it uses a tuple with the following fields:

'number'
     The breakpoint number.  For a breakpoint that represents one
     location of a multi-location breakpoint, this will be a dotted
     pair, like '1.2'.

'type'
     The type of the breakpoint.  For ordinary breakpoints this will be
     'breakpoint', but many values are possible.

'catch-type'
     If the type of the breakpoint is 'catchpoint', then this indicates
     the exact type of catchpoint.

'disp'
     This is the breakpoint disposition--either 'del', meaning that the
     breakpoint will be deleted at the next stop, or 'keep', meaning
     that the breakpoint will not be deleted.

'enabled'
     This indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled, in which case the
     value is 'y', or disabled, in which case the value is 'n'.  Note
     that this is not the same as the field 'enable'.

'addr'
     The address of the breakpoint.  This may be a hexidecimal number,
     giving the address; or the string '<PENDING>', for a pending
     breakpoint; or the string '<MULTIPLE>', for a breakpoint with
     multiple locations.  This field will not be present if no address
     can be determined.  For example, a watchpoint does not have an
     address.

'func'
     If known, the function in which the breakpoint appears.  If not
     known, this field is not present.

'filename'
     The name of the source file which contains this function, if known.
     If not known, this field is not present.

'fullname'
     The full file name of the source file which contains this function,
     if known.  If not known, this field is not present.

'line'
     The line number at which this breakpoint appears, if known.  If not
     known, this field is not present.

'at'
     If the source file is not known, this field may be provided.  If
     provided, this holds the address of the breakpoint, possibly
     followed by a symbol name.

'pending'
     If this breakpoint is pending, this field is present and holds the
     text used to set the breakpoint, as entered by the user.

'evaluated-by'
     Where this breakpoint's condition is evaluated, either 'host' or
     'target'.

'thread'
     If this is a thread-specific breakpoint, then this identifies the
     thread in which the breakpoint can trigger.

'task'
     If this breakpoint is restricted to a particular Ada task, then
     this field will hold the task identifier.

'cond'
     If the breakpoint is conditional, this is the condition expression.

'ignore'
     The ignore count of the breakpoint.

'enable'
     The enable count of the breakpoint.

'traceframe-usage'
     FIXME.

'static-tracepoint-marker-string-id'
     For a static tracepoint, the name of the static tracepoint marker.

'mask'
     For a masked watchpoint, this is the mask.

'pass'
     A tracepoint's pass count.

'original-location'
     The location of the breakpoint as originally specified by the user.
     This field is optional.

'times'
     The number of times the breakpoint has been hit.

'installed'
     This field is only given for tracepoints.  This is either 'y',
     meaning that the tracepoint is installed, or 'n', meaning that it
     is not.

'what'
     Some extra data, the exact contents of which are type-dependent.

   For example, here is what the output of '-break-insert' (*note GDB/MI
Breakpoint Commands::) might be:

     -> -break-insert main
     <- ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
         enabled="y",addr="0x08048564",func="main",file="myprog.c",
         fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68",thread-groups=["i1"],
         times="0"}
     <- (gdb)

27.5.5 GDB/MI Frame Information
-------------------------------

Response from many MI commands includes an information about stack
frame.  This information is a tuple that may have the following fields:

'level'
     The level of the stack frame.  The innermost frame has the level of
     zero.  This field is always present.

'func'
     The name of the function corresponding to the frame.  This field
     may be absent if GDB is unable to determine the function name.

'addr'
     The code address for the frame.  This field is always present.

'file'
     The name of the source files that correspond to the frame's code
     address.  This field may be absent.

'line'
     The source line corresponding to the frames' code address.  This
     field may be absent.

'from'
     The name of the binary file (either executable or shared library)
     the corresponds to the frame's code address.  This field may be
     absent.

27.5.6 GDB/MI Thread Information
--------------------------------

Whenever GDB has to report an information about a thread, it uses a
tuple with the following fields:

'id'
     The numeric id assigned to the thread by GDB.  This field is always
     present.

'target-id'
     Target-specific string identifying the thread.  This field is
     always present.

'details'
     Additional information about the thread provided by the target.  It
     is supposed to be human-readable and not interpreted by the
     frontend.  This field is optional.

'state'
     Either 'stopped' or 'running', depending on whether the thread is
     presently running.  This field is always present.

'core'
     The value of this field is an integer number of the processor core
     the thread was last seen on.  This field is optional.

27.5.7 GDB/MI Ada Exception Information
---------------------------------------

Whenever a '*stopped' record is emitted because the program stopped
after hitting an exception catchpoint (*note Set Catchpoints::), GDB
provides the name of the exception that was raised via the
'exception-name' field.

27.6 Simple Examples of GDB/MI Interaction
==========================================

This subsection presents several simple examples of interaction using
the GDB/MI interface.  In these examples, '->' means that the following
line is passed to GDB/MI as input, while '<-' means the output received
from GDB/MI.

   Note the line breaks shown in the examples are here only for
readability, they don't appear in the real output.

Setting a Breakpoint
--------------------

Setting a breakpoint generates synchronous output which contains
detailed information of the breakpoint.

     -> -break-insert main
     <- ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
         enabled="y",addr="0x08048564",func="main",file="myprog.c",
         fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68",thread-groups=["i1"],
         times="0"}
     <- (gdb)

Program Execution
-----------------

Program execution generates asynchronous records and MI gives the reason
that execution stopped.

     -> -exec-run
     <- ^running
     <- (gdb)
     <- *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",thread-id="0",
        frame={addr="0x08048564",func="main",
        args=[{name="argc",value="1"},{name="argv",value="0xbfc4d4d4"}],
        file="myprog.c",fullname="/home/nickrob/myprog.c",line="68"}
     <- (gdb)
     -> -exec-continue
     <- ^running
     <- (gdb)
     <- *stopped,reason="exited-normally"
     <- (gdb)

Quitting GDB
------------

Quitting GDB just prints the result class '^exit'.

     -> (gdb)
     <- -gdb-exit
     <- ^exit

   Please note that '^exit' is printed immediately, but it might take
some time for GDB to actually exit.  During that time, GDB performs
necessary cleanups, including killing programs being debugged or
disconnecting from debug hardware, so the frontend should wait till GDB
exits and should only forcibly kill GDB if it fails to exit in
reasonable time.

A Bad Command
-------------

Here's what happens if you pass a non-existent command:

     -> -rubbish
     <- ^error,msg="Undefined MI command: rubbish"
     <- (gdb)

27.8 GDB/MI Breakpoint Commands
===============================

This section documents GDB/MI commands for manipulating breakpoints.

The '-break-after' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-after NUMBER COUNT

   The breakpoint number NUMBER is not in effect until it has been hit
COUNT times.  To see how this is reflected in the output of the
'-break-list' command, see the description of the '-break-list' command
below.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'ignore'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
     enabled="y",addr="0x000100d0",func="main",file="hello.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/hello.c",line="5",thread-groups=["i1"],
     times="0"}
     (gdb)
     -break-after 1 3
     ~
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="6",
     hdr=[{width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="number",colhdr="Num"},
     {width="14",alignment="-1",col_name="type",colhdr="Type"},
     {width="4",alignment="-1",col_name="disp",colhdr="Disp"},
     {width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="enabled",colhdr="Enb"},
     {width="10",alignment="-1",col_name="addr",colhdr="Address"},
     {width="40",alignment="2",col_name="what",colhdr="What"}],

     addr="0x000100d0",func="main",file="hello.c",fullname="/home/foo/hello.c",
     line="5",thread-groups=["i1"],times="0",ignore="3"}]}
     (gdb)

The '-break-commands' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-commands NUMBER [ COMMAND1 ... COMMANDN ]

   Specifies the CLI commands that should be executed when breakpoint
NUMBER is hit.  The parameters COMMAND1 to COMMANDN are the commands.
If no command is specified, any previously-set commands are cleared.
*Note Break Commands::.  Typical use of this functionality is tracing a
program, that is, printing of values of some variables whenever
breakpoint is hit and then continuing.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'commands'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
     enabled="y",addr="0x000100d0",func="main",file="hello.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/hello.c",line="5",thread-groups=["i1"],
     times="0"}
     (gdb)
     -break-commands 1 "print v" "continue"
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-break-condition' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-condition NUMBER EXPR

   Breakpoint NUMBER will stop the program only if the condition in EXPR
is true.  The condition becomes part of the '-break-list' output (see
the description of the '-break-list' command below).

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'condition'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-condition 1 1
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="6",

     addr="0x000100d0",func="main",file="hello.c",fullname="/home/foo/hello.c",
     line="5",cond="1",thread-groups=["i1"],times="0",ignore="3"}]}
     (gdb)

The '-break-delete' Command
---------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-delete ( BREAKPOINT )+

   Delete the breakpoint(s) whose number(s) are specified in the
argument list.  This is obviously reflected in the breakpoint list.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'delete'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-delete 1
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="0",nr_cols="6",
     hdr=[{width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="number",colhdr="Num"},
     {width="14",alignment="-1",col_name="type",colhdr="Type"},
     {width="4",alignment="-1",col_name="disp",colhdr="Disp"},
     {width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="enabled",colhdr="Enb"},
     {width="10",alignment="-1",col_name="addr",colhdr="Address"},
     {width="40",alignment="2",col_name="what",colhdr="What"}],
     body=[]}
     (gdb)

The '-break-disable' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-disable ( BREAKPOINT )+

   Disable the named BREAKPOINT(s).  The field 'enabled' in the break
list is now set to 'n' for the named BREAKPOINT(s).

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'disable'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -break-disable 2
     ^done
     (gdb)
     -break-list
     ^done,BreakpointTable={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="6",
     hdr=[{width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="number",colhdr="Num"},
     {width="14",alignment="-1",col_name="type",colhdr="Type"},
     {width="4",alignment="-1",col_name="disp",colhdr="Disp"},
     {width="3",alignment="-1",col_name="enabled",colhdr="Enb"},
     {width="10",alignment="-1",col_name="addr",colhdr="Address"},

The '-break-passcount' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-passcount TRACEPOINT-NUMBER PASSCOUNT

   Set the passcount for tracepoint TRACEPOINT-NUMBER to PASSCOUNT.  If
the breakpoint referred to by TRACEPOINT-NUMBER is not a tracepoint,
error is emitted.  This corresponds to CLI command 'passcount'.

The '-break-watch' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -break-watch [ -a | -r ]

   Create a watchpoint.  With the '-a' option it will create an "access"
watchpoint, i.e., a watchpoint that triggers either on a read from or on
a write to the memory location.  With the '-r' option, the watchpoint
created is a "read" watchpoint, i.e., it will trigger only when the
memory location is accessed for reading.  Without either of the options,
the watchpoint created is a regular watchpoint, i.e., it will trigger
when the memory location is accessed for writing.  *Note Setting
Watchpoints: Set Watchpoints.

   Note that '-break-list' will report a single list of watchpoints and
breakpoints inserted.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'watch', 'awatch', and 'rwatch'.

Example
.......

Setting a watchpoint on a variable in the 'main' function:

     (gdb)
     -break-watch x
     ^done,wpt={number="2",exp="x"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-continue
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="watchpoint-trigger",wpt={number="2",exp="x"},
     value={old="-268439212",new="55"},
     frame={func="main",args=[],file="recursive2.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="5"}
     (gdb)

   Setting a watchpoint on a variable local to a function.  GDB will
stop the program execution twice: first for the variable changing value,
then for the watchpoint going out of scope.

     (gdb)
     -break-watch C
     ^done,wpt={number="5",exp="C"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-continue

     (gdb)

   Listing breakpoints and watchpoints, at different points in the
program execution.  Note that once the watchpoint goes out of scope, it
is deleted.

27.9.2 Ada Exception GDB/MI Catchpoints
---------------------------------------

The following GDB/MI commands can be used to create catchpoints that
stop the execution when Ada exceptions are being raised.

The '-catch-assert' Command
---------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -catch-assert [ -c CONDITION] [ -d ] [ -t ]

   Add a catchpoint for failed Ada assertions.

   The possible optional parameters for this command are:

'-c CONDITION'
     Make the catchpoint conditional on CONDITION.
'-d'
     Create a disabled catchpoint.
'-t'
     Create a temporary catchpoint.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'catch assert'.

Example
.......

     -catch-assert
     ^done,bkptno="5",bkpt={number="5",type="breakpoint",disp="keep",
     enabled="y",addr="0x0000000000404888",what="failed Ada assertions",
     thread-groups=["i1"],times="0",
     original-location="__gnat_debug_raise_assert_failure"}
     (gdb)

The '-catch-exception' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -catch-exception [ -c CONDITION] [ -d ] [ -e EXCEPTION-NAME ]
         [ -t ] [ -u ]

   Add a catchpoint stopping when Ada exceptions are raised.  By
default, the command stops the program when any Ada exception gets
raised.  But it is also possible, by using some of the optional
parameters described below, to create more selective catchpoints.

   The possible optional parameters for this command are:

'-c CONDITION'
     Make the catchpoint conditional on CONDITION.
'-d'
     Create a disabled catchpoint.
'-e EXCEPTION-NAME'
     Only stop when EXCEPTION-NAME is raised.  This option cannot be
     used combined with '-u'.
'-t'
     Create a temporary catchpoint.
'-u'
     Stop only when an unhandled exception gets raised.  This option
     cannot be used combined with '-e'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'catch exception' and 'catch
exception unhandled'.

Example
.......

      -exec-arguments ARGS

   Set the inferior program arguments, to be used in the next
'-exec-run'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'set args'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-arguments -v word
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-environment-cd' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis

The '-environment-directory' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -environment-directory [ -r ] [ PATHDIR ]+

   Add directories PATHDIR to beginning of search path for source files.
If the '-r' option is used, the search path is reset to the default
search path.  If directories PATHDIR are supplied in addition to the
'-r' option, the search path is first reset and then addition occurs as
normal.  Multiple directories may be specified, separated by blanks.
Specifying multiple directories in a single command results in the
directories added to the beginning of the search path in the same order
they were presented in the command.  If blanks are needed as part of a
directory name, double-quotes should be used around the name.  In the
command output, the path will show up separated by the system
directory-separator character.  The directory-separator character must
not be used in any directory name.  If no directories are specified, the
current search path is displayed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'dir'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -environment-directory /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/devo/gdb

      -environment-path [ -r ] [ PATHDIR ]+

   Add directories PATHDIR to beginning of search path for object files.
If the '-r' option is used, the search path is reset to the original
search path that existed at gdb start-up.  If directories PATHDIR are
supplied in addition to the '-r' option, the search path is first reset
and then addition occurs as normal.  Multiple directories may be
specified, separated by blanks.  Specifying multiple directories in a
single command results in the directories added to the beginning of the
search path in the same order they were presented in the command.  If
blanks are needed as part of a directory name, double-quotes should be
used around the name.  In the command output, the path will show up
separated by the system directory-separator character.  The
directory-separator character must not be used in any directory name.
If no directories are specified, the current path is displayed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'path'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -environment-path
     ^done,path="/usr/bin"
     (gdb)
     -environment-path /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/ppc-eabi/gdb /bin
     ^done,path="/kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/flathead-dev/ppc-eabi/gdb:/bin:/usr/bin"
     (gdb)
     -environment-path -r /usr/local/bin
     ^done,path="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin"
     (gdb)

The '-environment-pwd' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -environment-pwd

   Show the current working directory.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'pwd'.

Example

27.11 GDB/MI Thread Commands
============================

The '-thread-info' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -thread-info [ THREAD-ID ]

   Reports information about either a specific thread, if the THREAD-ID
parameter is present, or about all threads.  When printing information
about all threads, also reports the current thread.

GDB Command
...........

The 'info thread' command prints the same information about all threads.

Result
......

The result is a list of threads.  The following attributes are defined
for a given thread:

'current'
     This field exists only for the current thread.  It has the value
     '*'.

'id'
     The identifier that GDB uses to refer to the thread.

'target-id'
     The identifier that the target uses to refer to the thread.

'details'
     Extra information about the thread, in a target-specific format.
     This field is optional.

'name'
     The name of the thread.  If the user specified a name using the
     'thread name' command, then this name is given.  Otherwise, if GDB
     can extract the thread name from the target, then that name is
     given.  If GDB cannot find the thread name, then this field is
     omitted.

'frame'
     The stack frame currently executing in the thread.

'state'
     The thread's state.  The 'state' field may have the following
     values:

     'stopped'
          The thread is stopped.  Frame information is available for
          stopped threads.

     'running'
          The thread is running.  There's no frame information for
          running threads.

'core'
     If GDB can find the CPU core on which this thread is running, then
     this field is the core identifier.  This field is optional.

Example
.......

     -thread-info
     ^done,threads=[
     {id="2",target-id="Thread 0xb7e14b90 (LWP 21257)",
        frame={level="0",addr="0xffffe410",func="__kernel_vsyscall",
                args=[]},state="running"},
     {id="1",target-id="Thread 0xb7e156b0 (LWP 21254)",
        frame={level="0",addr="0x0804891f",func="foo",
                args=[{name="i",value="10"}],
                file="/tmp/a.c",fullname="/tmp/a.c",line="158"},
                state="running"}],
     current-thread-id="1"
     (gdb)

The '-thread-list-ids' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -thread-list-ids

   Produces a list of the currently known GDB thread ids.  At the end of
the list it also prints the total number of such threads.

   This command is retained for historical reasons, the '-thread-info'
command should be used instead.

GDB Command
...........

Part of 'info threads' supplies the same information.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -thread-list-ids
     ^done,thread-ids={thread-id="3",thread-id="2",thread-id="1"},
     current-thread-id="1",number-of-threads="3"
     (gdb)

The '-thread-select' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -thread-select THREADNUM

   Make THREADNUM the current thread.  It prints the number of the new
current thread, and the topmost frame for that thread.

   This command is deprecated in favor of explicitly using the
'--thread' option to each command.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'thread'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-next
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",thread-id="2",line="187",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.threads/linux-dp.c"
     (gdb)
     -thread-list-ids
     ^done,
     thread-ids={thread-id="3",thread-id="2",thread-id="1"},
     number-of-threads="3"
     (gdb)
     -thread-select 3
     ^done,new-thread-id="3",
     frame={level="0",func="vprintf",
     args=[{name="format",value="0x8048e9c \"%*s%c %d %c\\n\""},
     {name="arg",value="0x2"}],file="vprintf.c",line="31"}

27.12 GDB/MI Ada Tasking Commands
=================================

The '-ada-task-info' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -ada-task-info [ TASK-ID ]

   Reports information about either a specific Ada task, if the TASK-ID
parameter is present, or about all Ada tasks.

GDB Command
...........

The 'info tasks' command prints the same information about all Ada tasks
(*note Ada Tasks::).

Result
......

The result is a table of Ada tasks.  The following columns are defined
for each Ada task:

'current'
     This field exists only for the current thread.  It has the value
     '*'.

'id'
     The identifier that GDB uses to refer to the Ada task.

'task-id'
     The identifier that the target uses to refer to the Ada task.

'thread-id'
     The identifier of the thread corresponding to the Ada task.

     This field should always exist, as Ada tasks are always implemented
     on top of a thread.  But if GDB cannot find this corresponding
     thread for any reason, the field is omitted.

'parent-id'
     This field exists only when the task was created by another task.
     In this case, it provides the ID of the parent task.

'priority'
     The base priority of the task.

'state'
     The current state of the task.  For a detailed description of the
     possible states, see *note Ada Tasks::.

'name'
     The name of the task.

Example
.......

     -ada-task-info
     ^done,tasks={nr_rows="3",nr_cols="8",
     hdr=[{width="1",alignment="-1",col_name="current",colhdr=""},
     {width="3",alignment="1",col_name="id",colhdr="ID"},
     {width="9",alignment="1",col_name="task-id",colhdr="TID"},
     {width="4",alignment="1",col_name="thread-id",colhdr=""},
     {width="4",alignment="1",col_name="parent-id",colhdr="P-ID"},
     {width="3",alignment="1",col_name="priority",colhdr="Pri"},
     {width="22",alignment="-1",col_name="state",colhdr="State"},
     {width="1",alignment="2",col_name="name",colhdr="Name"}],
     body=[{current="*",id="1",task-id="   644010",thread-id="1",priority="48",
     state="Child Termination Wait",name="main_task"}]}

27.13 GDB/MI Program Execution
==============================

These are the asynchronous commands which generate the out-of-band
record '*stopped'.  Currently GDB only really executes asynchronously
with remote targets and this interaction is mimicked in other cases.

The '-exec-continue' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-continue [--reverse] [--all|--thread-group N]

   Resumes the execution of the inferior program, which will continue to
execute until it reaches a debugger stop event.  If the '--reverse'
option is specified, execution resumes in reverse until it reaches a
stop event.  Stop events may include
   * breakpoints or watchpoints
   * signals or exceptions
   * the end of the process (or its beginning under '--reverse')
   * the end or beginning of a replay log if one is being used.
   In all-stop mode (*note All-Stop Mode::), may resume only one thread,
or all threads, depending on the value of the 'scheduler-locking'
variable.  If '--all' is specified, all threads (in all inferiors) will
be resumed.  The '--all' option is ignored in all-stop mode.  If the
'--thread-group' options is specified, then all threads in that thread
group are resumed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB corresponding is 'continue'.

Example
.......

     -exec-continue
     ^running
     (gdb)
     @Hello world
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="2",frame={
     func="foo",args=[],file="hello.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/hello.c",
     line="13"}
     (gdb)

The '-exec-finish' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-finish [--reverse]

   Resumes the execution of the inferior program until the current
function is exited.  Displays the results returned by the function.  If
the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes the reverse execution of
the inferior program until the point where current function was called.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'finish'.

Example
.......

Function returning 'void'.

     -exec-finish
     ^running
     (gdb)
     @hello from foo
     *stopped,reason="function-finished",frame={func="main",args=[],
     file="hello.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/hello.c",line="7"}
     (gdb)

   Function returning other than 'void'.  The name of the internal GDB
variable storing the result is printed, together with the value itself.

     -exec-finish
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="function-finished",frame={addr="0x000107b0",func="foo",
     args=[{name="a",value="1"],{name="b",value="9"}},
     file="recursive2.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="14"},
     gdb-result-var="$1",return-value="0"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-interrupt' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-interrupt [--all|--thread-group N]

   Interrupts the background execution of the target.  Note how the
token associated with the stop message is the one for the execution
command that has been interrupted.  The token for the interrupt itself
only appears in the '^done' output.  If the user is trying to interrupt
a non-running program, an error message will be printed.

   Note that when asynchronous execution is enabled, this command is
asynchronous just like other execution commands.  That is, first the
'^done' response will be printed, and the target stop will be reported
after that using the '*stopped' notification.

   In non-stop mode, only the context thread is interrupted by default.
All threads (in all inferiors) will be interrupted if the '--all' option
is specified.  If the '--thread-group' option is specified, all threads
in that group will be interrupted.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'interrupt'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     111-exec-continue
     111^running

     (gdb)
     222-exec-interrupt
     222^done
     (gdb)
     111*stopped,signal-name="SIGINT",signal-meaning="Interrupt",
     frame={addr="0x00010140",func="foo",args=[],file="try.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",line="13"}
     (gdb)

     (gdb)
     -exec-interrupt
     ^error,msg="mi_cmd_exec_interrupt: Inferior not executing."
     (gdb)

The '-exec-jump' Command
------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-jump LOCATION

   Resumes execution of the inferior program at the location specified
by parameter.  *Note Specify Location::, for a description of the
different forms of LOCATION.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'jump'.

Example
.......

     -exec-jump foo.c:10
     *running,thread-id="all"
     ^running

The '-exec-next' Command
------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-next [--reverse]

   Resumes execution of the inferior program, stopping when the
beginning of the next source line is reached.

   If the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes reverse execution of
the inferior program, stopping at the beginning of the previous source
line.  If you issue this command on the first line of a function, it
will take you back to the caller of that function, to the source line
where the function was called.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'next'.

Example
.......

     -exec-next
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",line="8",file="hello.c"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-next-instruction' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-next-instruction [--reverse]

   Executes one machine instruction.  If the instruction is a function
call, continues until the function returns.  If the program stops at an
instruction in the middle of a source line, the address will be printed
as well.

   If the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes reverse execution of
the inferior program, stopping at the previous instruction.  If the
previously executed instruction was a return from another function, it
will continue to execute in reverse until the call to that function
(from the current stack frame) is reached.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'nexti'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-next-instruction
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     addr="0x000100d4",line="5",file="hello.c"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-return' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-return

   Makes current function return immediately.  Doesn't execute the
inferior.  Displays the new current frame.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'return'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     200-break-insert callee4
     200^done,bkpt={number="1",addr="0x00010734",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="8"}
     (gdb)
     000-exec-run

     (gdb)
     000*stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",
     frame={func="callee4",args=[],
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="8"}
     (gdb)
     205-break-delete
     205^done
     (gdb)
     111-exec-return
     111^done,frame={level="0",func="callee3",
     args=[{name="strarg",
     value="0x11940 \"A string argument.\""}],
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="18"}
     (gdb)

The '-exec-run' Command
-----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-run [ --all | --thread-group N ] [ --start ]

   Starts execution of the inferior from the beginning.  The inferior
executes until either a breakpoint is encountered or the program exits.
In the latter case the output will include an exit code, if the program
has exited exceptionally.

   When neither the '--all' nor the '--thread-group' option is
specified, the current inferior is started.  If the '--thread-group'
option is specified, it should refer to a thread group of type
'process', and that thread group will be started.  If the '--all' option
is specified, then all inferiors will be started.

   Using the '--start' option instructs the debugger to stop the
execution at the start of the inferior's main subprogram, following the
same behavior as the 'start' command (*note Starting::).

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'run'.

Examples
........

     (gdb)
     -break-insert main
     ^done,bkpt={number="1",addr="0x0001072c",file="recursive2.c",line="4"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",
     frame={func="main",args=[],file="recursive2.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="4"}
     (gdb)

Program exited normally:

     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     x = 55
     *stopped,reason="exited-normally"
     (gdb)

Program exited exceptionally:

     (gdb)
     -exec-run
     ^running
     (gdb)
     x = 55
     *stopped,reason="exited",exit-code="01"
     (gdb)

   Another way the program can terminate is if it receives a signal such
as 'SIGINT'.  In this case, GDB/MI displays this:

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="exited-signalled",signal-name="SIGINT",
     signal-meaning="Interrupt"

The '-exec-step' Command
------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-step [--reverse]

   Resumes execution of the inferior program, stopping when the
beginning of the next source line is reached, if the next source line is
not a function call.  If it is, stop at the first instruction of the
called function.  If the '--reverse' option is specified, resumes
reverse execution of the inferior program, stopping at the beginning of
the previously executed source line.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'step'.

Example
.......

Stepping into a function:

     -exec-step
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     frame={func="foo",args=[{name="a",value="10"},
     {name="b",value="0"}],file="recursive2.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/recursive2.c",line="11"}
     (gdb)

   Regular stepping:

     -exec-step
     ^running
     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",line="14",file="recursive2.c"
     (gdb)

The '-exec-step-instruction' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-step-instruction [--reverse]

   Resumes the inferior which executes one machine instruction.  If the
'--reverse' option is specified, resumes reverse execution of the
inferior program, stopping at the previously executed instruction.  The
output, once GDB has stopped, will vary depending on whether we have
stopped in the middle of a source line or not.  In the former case, the
address at which the program stopped will be printed as well.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'stepi'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-step-instruction
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     frame={func="foo",args=[],file="try.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",line="10"}
     (gdb)
     -exec-step-instruction
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="end-stepping-range",
     frame={addr="0x000100f4",func="foo",args=[],file="try.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",line="10"}
     (gdb)

The '-exec-until' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -exec-until [ LOCATION ]

   Executes the inferior until the LOCATION specified in the argument is
reached.  If there is no argument, the inferior executes until a source
line greater than the current one is reached.  The reason for stopping
in this case will be 'location-reached'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'until'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -exec-until recursive2.c:6
     ^running
     (gdb)
     x = 55
     *stopped,reason="location-reached",frame={func="main",args=[],

27.14 GDB/MI Stack Manipulation Commands
========================================

The '-enable-frame-filters' Command
-----------------------------------

     -enable-frame-filters

   GDB allows Python-based frame filters to affect the output of the MI
commands relating to stack traces.  As there is no way to implement this
in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must request that this
functionality be enabled.

   Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

   Note that if Python support has not been compiled into GDB, this
command will still succeed (and do nothing).

The '-stack-info-frame' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-info-frame

   Get info on the selected frame.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'info frame' or 'frame' (without
arguments).

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -stack-info-frame
     ^done,frame={level="1",addr="0x0001076c",func="callee3",
     file="../../../devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/home/foo/bar/devo/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",line="17"}
     (gdb)

The '-stack-info-depth' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-info-depth [ MAX-DEPTH ]

   Return the depth of the stack.  If the integer argument MAX-DEPTH is
specified, do not count beyond MAX-DEPTH frames.

GDB Command
...........

There's no equivalent GDB command.

Example
.......

For a stack with frame levels 0 through 11:

     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 4
     ^done,depth="4"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 12
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 11
     ^done,depth="11"
     (gdb)
     -stack-info-depth 13
     ^done,depth="12"
     (gdb)

The '-stack-list-arguments' Command
-----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-arguments [ --no-frame-filters ] [ --skip-unavailable ] PRINT-VALUES
         [ LOW-FRAME HIGH-FRAME ]

   Display a list of the arguments for the frames between LOW-FRAME and
HIGH-FRAME (inclusive).  If LOW-FRAME and HIGH-FRAME are not provided,
list the arguments for the whole call stack.  If the two arguments are
equal, show the single frame at the corresponding level.  It is an error
if LOW-FRAME is larger than the actual number of frames.  On the other
hand, HIGH-FRAME may be larger than the actual number of frames, in
which case only existing frames will be returned.

   If PRINT-VALUES is 0 or '--no-values', print only the names of the
variables; if it is 1 or '--all-values', print also their values; and if
it is 2 or '--simple-values', print the name, type and value for simple
data types, and the name and type for arrays, structures and unions.  If
the option '--no-frame-filters' is supplied, then Python frame filters
will not be executed.

   If the '--skip-unavailable' option is specified, arguments that are
not available are not listed.  Partially available arguments are still
displayed, however.

   Use of this command to obtain arguments in a single frame is
deprecated in favor of the '-stack-list-variables' command.

GDB Command
...........

GDB does not have an equivalent command.  'gdbtk' has a 'gdb_get_args'
command which partially overlaps with the functionality of
'-stack-list-arguments'.

The '-stack-list-frames' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-frames [ --no-frame-filters LOW-FRAME HIGH-FRAME ]

   List the frames currently on the stack.  For each frame it displays
the following info:

'LEVEL'
     The frame number, 0 being the topmost frame, i.e., the innermost
     function.
'ADDR'
     The '$pc' value for that frame.
'FUNC'
     Function name.
'FILE'
     File name of the source file where the function lives.
'FULLNAME'
     The full file name of the source file where the function lives.
'LINE'
     Line number corresponding to the '$pc'.
'FROM'
     The shared library where this function is defined.  This is only
     given if the frame's function is not known.

   If invoked without arguments, this command prints a backtrace for the
whole stack.  If given two integer arguments, it shows the frames whose
levels are between the two arguments (inclusive).  If the two arguments
are equal, it shows the single frame at the corresponding level.  It is
an error if LOW-FRAME is larger than the actual number of frames.  On
the other hand, HIGH-FRAME may be larger than the actual number of
frames, in which case only existing frames will be returned.  If the
option '--no-frame-filters' is supplied, then Python frame filters will
not be executed.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'backtrace' and 'where'.

The '-stack-list-locals' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -stack-list-locals [ --no-frame-filters ] [ --skip-unavailable ] PRINT-VALUES

   Display the local variable names for the selected frame.  If
PRINT-VALUES is 0 or '--no-values', print only the names of the
variables; if it is 1 or '--all-values', print also their values; and if
it is 2 or '--simple-values', print the name, type and value for simple
data types, and the name and type for arrays, structures and unions.  In
this last case, a frontend can immediately display the value of simple
data types and create variable objects for other data types when the
user wishes to explore their values in more detail.  If the option
'--no-frame-filters' is supplied, then Python frame filters will not be
executed.

   If the '--skip-unavailable' option is specified, local variables that
are not available are not listed.  Partially available local variables
are still displayed, however.

27.15 GDB/MI Variable Objects
=============================

Introduction to Variable Objects
--------------------------------

Variable objects are "object-oriented" MI interface for examining and
changing values of expressions.  Unlike some other MI interfaces that
work with expressions, variable objects are specifically designed for
simple and efficient presentation in the frontend.  A variable object is
identified by string name.  When a variable object is created, the
frontend specifies the expression for that variable object.  The
expression can be a simple variable, or it can be an arbitrary complex
expression, and can even involve CPU registers.  After creating a
variable object, the frontend can invoke other variable object
operations--for example to obtain or change the value of a variable
object, or to change display format.

   Variable objects have hierarchical tree structure.  Any variable
object that corresponds to a composite type, such as structure in C, has
a number of child variable objects, for example corresponding to each
element of a structure.  A child variable object can itself have
children, recursively.  Recursion ends when we reach leaf variable
objects, which always have built-in types.  Child variable objects are
created only by explicit request, so if a frontend is not interested in
the children of a particular variable object, no child will be created.

   For a leaf variable object it is possible to obtain its value as a
string, or set the value from a string.  String value can be also
obtained for a non-leaf variable object, but it's generally a string
that only indicates the type of the object, and does not list its
contents.  Assignment to a non-leaf variable object is not allowed.

   A frontend does not need to read the values of all variable objects
each time the program stops.  Instead, MI provides an update command
that lists all variable objects whose values has changed since the last
update operation.  This considerably reduces the amount of data that
must be transferred to the frontend.  As noted above, children variable
objects are created on demand, and only leaf variable objects have a
real value.  As result, gdb will read target memory only for leaf
variables that frontend has created.

   The automatic update is not always desirable.  For example, a
frontend might want to keep a value of some expression for future
reference, and never update it.  For another example, fetching memory is
relatively slow for embedded targets, so a frontend might want to
disable automatic update for the variables that are either not visible
on the screen, or "closed".  This is possible using so called "frozen
variable objects".  Such variable objects are never implicitly updated.

   Variable objects can be either "fixed" or "floating".  For the fixed
variable object, the expression is parsed when the variable object is
created, including associating identifiers to specific variables.  The
meaning of expression never changes.  For a floating variable object the
values of variables whose names appear in the expressions are
re-evaluated every time in the context of the current frame.  Consider
this example:

     void do_work(...)
     {
             struct work_state state;

             if (...)
                do_work(...);
     }

   If a fixed variable object for the 'state' variable is created in
this function, and we enter the recursive call, the variable object will
report the value of 'state' in the top-level 'do_work' invocation.  On
the other hand, a floating variable object will report the value of
'state' in the current frame.

   If an expression specified when creating a fixed variable object
refers to a local variable, the variable object becomes bound to the
thread and frame in which the variable object is created.  When such
variable object is updated, GDB makes sure that the thread/frame
combination the variable object is bound to still exists, and
re-evaluates the variable object in context of that thread/frame.

   The following is the complete set of GDB/MI operations defined to
access this functionality:

*Operation*                   *Description*
                              
'-enable-pretty-printing'     enable Python-based pretty-printing
'-var-create'                 create a variable object
'-var-delete'                 delete the variable object and/or its
                              children
'-var-set-format'             set the display format of this variable
'-var-show-format'            show the display format of this variable
'-var-info-num-children'      tells how many children this object has
'-var-list-children'          return a list of the object's children
'-var-info-type'              show the type of this variable object
'-var-info-expression'        print parent-relative expression that
                              this variable object represents
'-var-info-path-expression'   print full expression that this variable
                              object represents
'-var-show-attributes'        is this variable editable?  does it exist
                              here?
'-var-evaluate-expression'    get the value of this variable
'-var-assign'                 set the value of this variable
'-var-update'                 update the variable and its children
'-var-set-frozen'             set frozeness attribute
'-var-set-update-range'       set range of children to display on
                              update

   In the next subsection we describe each operation in detail and
suggest how it can be used.

Description And Use of Operations on Variable Objects
-----------------------------------------------------

The '-enable-pretty-printing' Command
-------------------------------------

     -enable-pretty-printing

   GDB allows Python-based visualizers to affect the output of the MI
variable object commands.  However, because there was no way to
implement this in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must
request that this functionality be enabled.

   Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.

   Note that if Python support has not been compiled into GDB, this
command will still succeed (and do nothing).

   This feature is currently (as of GDB 7.0) experimental, and may work
differently in future versions of GDB.

The '-var-create' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-create {NAME | "-"}
         {FRAME-ADDR | "*" | "@"} EXPRESSION

   This operation creates a variable object, which allows the monitoring
of a variable, the result of an expression, a memory cell or a CPU
register.

   The NAME parameter is the string by which the object can be
referenced.  It must be unique.  If '-' is specified, the varobj system
will generate a string "varNNNNNN" automatically.  It will be unique
provided that one does not specify NAME of that format.  The command
fails if a duplicate name is found.

   The frame under which the expression should be evaluated can be
specified by FRAME-ADDR.  A '*' indicates that the current frame should
be used.  A '@' indicates that a floating variable object must be
created.

   EXPRESSION is any expression valid on the current language set (must
not begin with a '*'), or one of the following:

   * '*ADDR', where ADDR is the address of a memory cell

   * '*ADDR-ADDR' -- a memory address range (TBD)

   * '$REGNAME' -- a CPU register name

   A varobj's contents may be provided by a Python-based pretty-printer.
In this case the varobj is known as a "dynamic varobj".  Dynamic varobjs
have slightly different semantics in some cases.  If the
'-enable-pretty-printing' command is not sent, then GDB will never
create a dynamic varobj.  This ensures backward compatibility for
existing clients.

Result
......

This operation returns attributes of the newly-created varobj.  These
are:

'name'
     The name of the varobj.

'numchild'
     The number of children of the varobj.  This number is not
     necessarily reliable for a dynamic varobj.  Instead, you must
     examine the 'has_more' attribute.

'value'
     The varobj's scalar value.  For a varobj whose type is some sort of
     aggregate (e.g., a 'struct'), or for a dynamic varobj, this value
     will not be interesting.

'type'
     The varobj's type.  This is a string representation of the type, as
     would be printed by the GDB CLI. If 'print object' (*note set print
     object: Print Settings.) is set to 'on', the _actual_ (derived)
     type of the object is shown rather than the _declared_ one.

'thread-id'
     If a variable object is bound to a specific thread, then this is
     the thread's identifier.

'has_more'
     For a dynamic varobj, this indicates whether there appear to be any
     children available.  For a non-dynamic varobj, this will be 0.

'dynamic'
     This attribute will be present and have the value '1' if the varobj
     is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj, then
     this attribute will not be present.

'displayhint'
     A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
     value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
     'display_hint' method.  *Note Pretty Printing API::.

   Typical output will look like this:

      name="NAME",numchild="N",type="TYPE",thread-id="M",
       has_more="HAS_MORE"

The '-var-delete' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-delete [ -c ] NAME

   Deletes a previously created variable object and all of its children.
With the '-c' option, just deletes the children.

   Returns an error if the object NAME is not found.

The '-var-set-format' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-format NAME FORMAT-SPEC

   Sets the output format for the value of the object NAME to be
FORMAT-SPEC.

   The syntax for the FORMAT-SPEC is as follows:

      FORMAT-SPEC ==>
      {binary | decimal | hexadecimal | octal | natural}

   The natural format is the default format choosen automatically based
on the variable type (like decimal for an 'int', hex for pointers,
etc.).

   For a variable with children, the format is set only on the variable
itself, and the children are not affected.

The '-var-show-format' Command
------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-show-format NAME

   Returns the format used to display the value of the object NAME.

      FORMAT ==>
      FORMAT-SPEC

The '-var-info-num-children' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-num-children NAME

   Returns the number of children of a variable object NAME:

      numchild=N

   Note that this number is not completely reliable for a dynamic
varobj.  It will return the current number of children, but more
children may be available.

The '-var-list-children' Command
--------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-list-children [PRINT-VALUES] NAME [FROM TO]

   Return a list of the children of the specified variable object and
create variable objects for them, if they do not already exist.  With a
single argument or if PRINT-VALUES has a value of 0 or '--no-values',
print only the names of the variables; if PRINT-VALUES is 1 or
'--all-values', also print their values; and if it is 2 or
'--simple-values' print the name and value for simple data types and
just the name for arrays, structures and unions.

   FROM and TO, if specified, indicate the range of children to report.
If FROM or TO is less than zero, the range is reset and all children
will be reported.  Otherwise, children starting at FROM (zero-based) and
up to and excluding TO will be reported.

   If a child range is requested, it will only affect the current call
to '-var-list-children', but not future calls to '-var-update'.  For
this, you must instead use '-var-set-update-range'.  The intent of this
approach is to enable a front end to implement any update approach it
likes; for example, scrolling a view may cause the front end to request
more children with '-var-list-children', and then the front end could
call '-var-set-update-range' with a different range to ensure that
future updates are restricted to just the visible items.

   For each child the following results are returned:

NAME
     Name of the variable object created for this child.

EXP
     The expression to be shown to the user by the front end to
     designate this child.  For example this may be the name of a
     structure member.

     For a dynamic varobj, this value cannot be used to form an
     expression.  There is no way to do this at all with a dynamic
     varobj.

     For C/C++ structures there are several pseudo children returned to
     designate access qualifiers.  For these pseudo children EXP is
     'public', 'private', or 'protected'.  In this case the type and
     value are not present.

     A dynamic varobj will not report the access qualifying
     pseudo-children, regardless of the language.  This information is
     not available at all with a dynamic varobj.

NUMCHILD
     Number of children this child has.  For a dynamic varobj, this will
     be 0.

TYPE
     The type of the child.  If 'print object' (*note set print object:
     Print Settings.) is set to 'on', the _actual_ (derived) type of the
     object is shown rather than the _declared_ one.

VALUE
     If values were requested, this is the value.

THREAD-ID
     If this variable object is associated with a thread, this is the
     thread id.  Otherwise this result is not present.

FROZEN
     If the variable object is frozen, this variable will be present
     with a value of 1.

DISPLAYHINT
     A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
     value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
     'display_hint' method.  *Note Pretty Printing API::.

DYNAMIC
     This attribute will be present and have the value '1' if the varobj
     is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj, then
     this attribute will not be present.

   The result may have its own attributes:

'displayhint'
     A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
     value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object's
     'display_hint' method.  *Note Pretty Printing API::.

'has_more'
     This is an integer attribute which is nonzero if there are children
     remaining after the end of the selected range.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
      -var-list-children n
      ^done,numchild=N,children=[child={name=NAME,exp=EXP,
      numchild=N,type=TYPE},(repeats N times)]
     (gdb)
      -var-list-children --all-values n
      ^done,numchild=N,children=[child={name=NAME,exp=EXP,
      numchild=N,value=VALUE,type=TYPE},(repeats N times)]

The '-var-info-type' Command
----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-type NAME

   Returns the type of the specified variable NAME.  The type is
returned as a string in the same format as it is output by the GDB CLI:

      type=TYPENAME

The '-var-info-expression' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-expression NAME

   Returns a string that is suitable for presenting this variable object
in user interface.  The string is generally not valid expression in the
current language, and cannot be evaluated.

   For example, if 'a' is an array, and variable object 'A' was created
for 'a', then we'll get this output:

     (gdb) -var-info-expression A.1
     ^done,lang="C",exp="1"

Here, the value of 'lang' is the language name, which can be found in
*note Supported Languages::.

   Note that the output of the '-var-list-children' command also
includes those expressions, so the '-var-info-expression' command is of
limited use.

The '-var-info-path-expression' Command
---------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-info-path-expression NAME

   Returns an expression that can be evaluated in the current context
and will yield the same value that a variable object has.  Compare this
with the '-var-info-expression' command, which result can be used only
for UI presentation.  Typical use of the '-var-info-path-expression'
command is creating a watchpoint from a variable object.

   This command is currently not valid for children of a dynamic varobj,
and will give an error when invoked on one.

   For example, suppose 'C' is a C++ class, derived from class 'Base',
and that the 'Base' class has a member called 'm_size'.  Assume a
variable 'c' is has the type of 'C' and a variable object 'C' was
created for variable 'c'.  Then, we'll get this output:
     (gdb) -var-info-path-expression C.Base.public.m_size
     ^done,path_expr=((Base)c).m_size)

The '-var-show-attributes' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-show-attributes NAME

   List attributes of the specified variable object NAME:

      status=ATTR [ ( ,ATTR )* ]

where ATTR is '{ { editable | noneditable } | TBD }'.

The '-var-evaluate-expression' Command
--------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-evaluate-expression [-f FORMAT-SPEC] NAME

   Evaluates the expression that is represented by the specified
variable object and returns its value as a string.  The format of the
string can be specified with the '-f' option.  The possible values of
this option are the same as for '-var-set-format' (*note
-var-set-format::).  If the '-f' option is not specified, the current
display format will be used.  The current display format can be changed
using the '-var-set-format' command.

      value=VALUE

   Note that one must invoke '-var-list-children' for a variable before
the value of a child variable can be evaluated.

The '-var-assign' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-assign NAME EXPRESSION

   Assigns the value of EXPRESSION to the variable object specified by
NAME.  The object must be 'editable'.  If the variable's value is
altered by the assign, the variable will show up in any subsequent
'-var-update' list.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-assign var1 3
     ^done,value="3"
     (gdb)
     -var-update *
     ^done,changelist=[{name="var1",in_scope="true",type_changed="false"}]
     (gdb)

The '-var-update' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-update [PRINT-VALUES] {NAME | "*"}

   Reevaluate the expressions corresponding to the variable object NAME
and all its direct and indirect children, and return the list of
variable objects whose values have changed; NAME must be a root variable
object.  Here, "changed" means that the result of
'-var-evaluate-expression' before and after the '-var-update' is
different.  If '*' is used as the variable object names, all existing
variable objects are updated, except for frozen ones (*note
-var-set-frozen::).  The option PRINT-VALUES determines whether both
names and values, or just names are printed.  The possible values of
this option are the same as for '-var-list-children' (*note
-var-list-children::).  It is recommended to use the '--all-values'
option, to reduce the number of MI commands needed on each program stop.

   With the '*' parameter, if a variable object is bound to a currently
running thread, it will not be updated, without any diagnostic.

   If '-var-set-update-range' was previously used on a varobj, then only
the selected range of children will be reported.

   '-var-update' reports all the changed varobjs in a tuple named
'changelist'.

   Each item in the change list is itself a tuple holding:

'name'
     The name of the varobj.

'value'
     If values were requested for this update, then this field will be
     present and will hold the value of the varobj.

'in_scope'
     This field is a string which may take one of three values:

     '"true"'
          The variable object's current value is valid.

     '"false"'
          The variable object does not currently hold a valid value but
          it may hold one in the future if its associated expression
          comes back into scope.

     '"invalid"'
          The variable object no longer holds a valid value.  This can
          occur when the executable file being debugged has changed,
          either through recompilation or by using the GDB 'file'
          command.  The front end should normally choose to delete these
          variable objects.

     In the future new values may be added to this list so the front
     should be prepared for this possibility.  *Note GDB/MI Development
     and Front Ends: GDB/MI Development and Front Ends.

'type_changed'
     This is only present if the varobj is still valid.  If the type
     changed, then this will be the string 'true'; otherwise it will be
     'false'.

     When a varobj's type changes, its children are also likely to have
     become incorrect.  Therefore, the varobj's children are
     automatically deleted when this attribute is 'true'.  Also, the
     varobj's update range, when set using the '-var-set-update-range'
     command, is unset.

'new_type'
     If the varobj's type changed, then this field will be present and
     will hold the new type.

'new_num_children'
     For a dynamic varobj, if the number of children changed, or if the
     type changed, this will be the new number of children.

     The 'numchild' field in other varobj responses is generally not
     valid for a dynamic varobj - it will show the number of children
     that GDB knows about, but because dynamic varobjs lazily
     instantiate their children, this will not reflect the number of
     children which may be available.

     The 'new_num_children' attribute only reports changes to the number
     of children known by GDB.  This is the only way to detect whether
     an update has removed children (which necessarily can only happen
     at the end of the update range).

'displayhint'
     The display hint, if any.

'has_more'
     This is an integer value, which will be 1 if there are more
     children available outside the varobj's update range.

'dynamic'
     This attribute will be present and have the value '1' if the varobj
     is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj, then
     this attribute will not be present.

'new_children'
     If new children were added to a dynamic varobj within the selected
     update range (as set by '-var-set-update-range'), then they will be
     listed in this attribute.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-assign var1 3
     ^done,value="3"
     (gdb)
     -var-update --all-values var1
     ^done,changelist=[{name="var1",value="3",in_scope="true",
     type_changed="false"}]
     (gdb)

The '-var-set-frozen' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-frozen NAME FLAG

   Set the frozenness flag on the variable object NAME.  The FLAG
parameter should be either '1' to make the variable frozen or '0' to
make it unfrozen.  If a variable object is frozen, then neither itself,
nor any of its children, are implicitly updated by '-var-update' of a
parent variable or by '-var-update *'.  Only '-var-update' of the
variable itself will update its value and values of its children.  After
a variable object is unfrozen, it is implicitly updated by all
subsequent '-var-update' operations.  Unfreezing a variable does not
update it, only subsequent '-var-update' does.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-set-frozen V 1
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-var-set-update-range' command
-----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-update-range NAME FROM TO

   Set the range of children to be returned by future invocations of
'-var-update'.

   FROM and TO indicate the range of children to report.  If FROM or TO
is less than zero, the range is reset and all children will be reported.
Otherwise, children starting at FROM (zero-based) and up to and
excluding TO will be reported.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -var-set-update-range V 1 2
     ^done

The '-var-set-visualizer' command
---------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -var-set-visualizer NAME VISUALIZER

   Set a visualizer for the variable object NAME.

   VISUALIZER is the visualizer to use.  The special value 'None' means
to disable any visualizer in use.

   If not 'None', VISUALIZER must be a Python expression.  This
expression must evaluate to a callable object which accepts a single
argument.  GDB will call this object with the value of the varobj NAME
as an argument (this is done so that the same Python pretty-printing
code can be used for both the CLI and MI). When called, this object must
return an object which conforms to the pretty-printing interface (*note
Pretty Printing API::).

   The pre-defined function 'gdb.default_visualizer' may be used to
select a visualizer by following the built-in process (*note Selecting
Pretty-Printers::).  This is done automatically when a varobj is
created, and so ordinarily is not needed.

   This feature is only available if Python support is enabled.  The MI
command '-list-features' (*note GDB/MI Support Commands::) can be used
to check this.

Example
.......

Resetting the visualizer:

     (gdb)
     -var-set-visualizer V None
     ^done

   Reselecting the default (type-based) visualizer:

     (gdb)
     -var-set-visualizer V gdb.default_visualizer
     ^done

   Suppose 'SomeClass' is a visualizer class.  A lambda expression can
be used to instantiate this class for a varobj:

     (gdb)
     -var-set-visualizer V "lambda val: SomeClass()"
     ^done

27.16 GDB/MI Data Manipulation
==============================

This section describes the GDB/MI commands that manipulate data: examine
memory and registers, evaluate expressions, etc.

The '-data-disassemble' Command
-------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-disassemble
         [ -s START-ADDR -e END-ADDR ]
       | [ -f FILENAME -l LINENUM [ -n LINES ] ]
       -- MODE

Where:

'START-ADDR'
     is the beginning address (or '$pc')
'END-ADDR'
     is the end address
'FILENAME'
     is the name of the file to disassemble
'LINENUM'
     is the line number to disassemble around
'LINES'
     is the number of disassembly lines to be produced.  If it is -1,
     the whole function will be disassembled, in case no END-ADDR is
     specified.  If END-ADDR is specified as a non-zero value, and LINES
     is lower than the number of disassembly lines between START-ADDR
     and END-ADDR, only LINES lines are displayed; if LINES is higher
     than the number of lines between START-ADDR and END-ADDR, only the
     lines up to END-ADDR are displayed.
'MODE'
     is either 0 (meaning only disassembly), 1 (meaning mixed source and
     disassembly), 2 (meaning disassembly with raw opcodes), or 3
     (meaning mixed source and disassembly with raw opcodes).

Result
......

The result of the '-data-disassemble' command will be a list named
'asm_insns', the contents of this list depend on the MODE used with the
'-data-disassemble' command.

   For modes 0 and 2 the 'asm_insns' list contains tuples with the
following fields:

'address'
     The address at which this instruction was disassembled.

'func-name'
     The name of the function this instruction is within.

'offset'
     The decimal offset in bytes from the start of 'func-name'.

'inst'
     The text disassembly for this 'address'.

'opcodes'
     This field is only present for mode 2.  This contains the raw
     opcode bytes for the 'inst' field.

   For modes 1 and 3 the 'asm_insns' list contains tuples named
'src_and_asm_line', each of which has the following fields:

'line'
     The line number within 'file'.

'file'
     The file name from the compilation unit.  This might be an absolute
     file name or a relative file name depending on the compile command
     used.

'fullname'
     Absolute file name of 'file'.  It is converted to a canonical form
     using the source file search path (*note Specifying Source
     Directories: Source Path.) and after resolving all the symbolic
     links.

     If the source file is not found this field will contain the path as
     present in the debug information.

'line_asm_insn'
     This is a list of tuples containing the disassembly for 'line' in
     'file'.  The fields of each tuple are the same as for
     '-data-disassemble' in MODE 0 and 2, so 'address', 'func-name',
     'offset', 'inst', and optionally 'opcodes'.

   Note that whatever included in the 'inst' field, is not manipulated
directly by GDB/MI, i.e., it is not possible to adjust its format.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'disassemble'.

Example
.......

Disassemble from the current value of '$pc' to '$pc + 20':

     (gdb)
     -data-disassemble -s $pc -e "$pc + 20" -- 0
     ^done,
     asm_insns=[
     {address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
     inst="mov  2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
     {address="0x000107c8",func-name="main",offset="12",
     inst="or  %o2, 0x140, %o1\t! 0x11940 <_lib_version+8>"},
     {address="0x000107cc",func-name="main",offset="16",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
     {address="0x000107d0",func-name="main",offset="20",
     inst="or  %o2, 0x168, %o4\t! 0x11968 <_lib_version+48>"}]
     (gdb)

   Disassemble the whole 'main' function.  Line 32 is part of 'main'.

     -data-disassemble -f basics.c -l 32 -- 0
     ^done,asm_insns=[
     {address="0x000107bc",func-name="main",offset="0",
     inst="save  %sp, -112, %sp"},
     {address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
     inst="mov   2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi %hi(0x11800), %o2"},
     [...]
     {address="0x0001081c",func-name="main",offset="96",inst="ret "},
     {address="0x00010820",func-name="main",offset="100",inst="restore "}]
     (gdb)

   Disassemble 3 instructions from the start of 'main':

     (gdb)
     -data-disassemble -f basics.c -l 32 -n 3 -- 0
     ^done,asm_insns=[
     {address="0x000107bc",func-name="main",offset="0",
     inst="save  %sp, -112, %sp"},
     {address="0x000107c0",func-name="main",offset="4",
     inst="mov  2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"}]
     (gdb)

   Disassemble 3 instructions from the start of 'main' in mixed mode:

     (gdb)
     -data-disassemble -f basics.c -l 32 -n 3 -- 1
     ^done,asm_insns=[
     src_and_asm_line={line="31",
     file="../../../src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/absolute/path/to/src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     line_asm_insn=[{address="0x000107bc",
     func-name="main",offset="0",inst="save  %sp, -112, %sp"}]},
     src_and_asm_line={line="32",
     file="../../../src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     fullname="/absolute/path/to/src/gdb/testsuite/gdb.mi/basics.c",
     line_asm_insn=[{address="0x000107c0",
     func-name="main",offset="4",inst="mov  2, %o0"},
     {address="0x000107c4",func-name="main",offset="8",
     inst="sethi  %hi(0x11800), %o2"}]}]
     (gdb)

The '-data-evaluate-expression' Command
---------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-evaluate-expression EXPR

   Evaluate EXPR as an expression.  The expression could contain an
inferior function call.  The function call will execute synchronously.
If the expression contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'print', 'output', and 'call'.  In
'gdbtk' only, there's a corresponding 'gdb_eval' command.

Example
.......

In the following example, the numbers that precede the commands are the
"tokens" described in *note GDB/MI Command Syntax: GDB/MI Command
Syntax.  Notice how GDB/MI returns the same tokens in its output.

     211-data-evaluate-expression A
     211^done,value="1"
     (gdb)
     311-data-evaluate-expression &A
     311^done,value="0xefffeb7c"
     (gdb)
     411-data-evaluate-expression A+3
     411^done,value="4"
     (gdb)
     511-data-evaluate-expression "A + 3"
     511^done,value="4"
     (gdb)

The '-data-list-changed-registers' Command
------------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-list-changed-registers

   Display a list of the registers that have changed.

GDB Command
...........

GDB doesn't have a direct analog for this command; 'gdbtk' has the
corresponding command 'gdb_changed_register_list'.

Example
.......

On a PPC MBX board:

     (gdb)
     -exec-continue
     ^running

     (gdb)
     *stopped,reason="breakpoint-hit",disp="keep",bkptno="1",frame={
     func="main",args=[],file="try.c",fullname="/home/foo/bar/try.c",
     line="5"}
     (gdb)
     -data-list-changed-registers
     ^done,changed-registers=["0","1","2","4","5","6","7","8","9",
     "10","11","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23",
     "24","25","26","27","28","30","31","64","65","66","67","69"]
     (gdb)

The '-data-list-register-names' Command
---------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-list-register-names [ ( REGNO )+ ]

   Show a list of register names for the current target.  If no
arguments are given, it shows a list of the names of all the registers.
If integer numbers are given as arguments, it will print a list of the
names of the registers corresponding to the arguments.  To ensure
consistency between a register name and its number, the output list may
include empty register names.

GDB Command
...........

GDB does not have a command which corresponds to
'-data-list-register-names'.  In 'gdbtk' there is a corresponding
command 'gdb_regnames'.

Example
.......

For the PPC MBX board:
     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-names
     ^done,register-names=["r0","r1","r2","r3","r4","r5","r6","r7",
     "r8","r9","r10","r11","r12","r13","r14","r15","r16","r17","r18",
     "r19","r20","r21","r22","r23","r24","r25","r26","r27","r28","r29",
     "r30","r31","f0","f1","f2","f3","f4","f5","f6","f7","f8","f9",
     "f10","f11","f12","f13","f14","f15","f16","f17","f18","f19","f20",
     "f21","f22","f23","f24","f25","f26","f27","f28","f29","f30","f31",
     "", "pc","ps","cr","lr","ctr","xer"]
     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-names 1 2 3
     ^done,register-names=["r1","r2","r3"]
     (gdb)

The '-data-list-register-values' Command
----------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-list-register-values
         [ --skip-unavailable ] FMT [ ( REGNO )*]

   Display the registers' contents.  The format according to which the
registers' contents are to be returned is given by FMT, followed by an
optional list of numbers specifying the registers to display.  A missing
list of numbers indicates that the contents of all the registers must be
returned.  The '--skip-unavailable' option indicates that only the
available registers are to be returned.

   Allowed formats for FMT are:

'x'
     Hexadecimal
'o'
     Octal
't'
     Binary
'd'
     Decimal
'r'
     Raw
'N'
     Natural

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB commands are 'info reg', 'info all-reg', and (in
'gdbtk') 'gdb_fetch_registers'.

Example
.......

For a PPC MBX board (note: line breaks are for readability only, they
don't appear in the actual output):

     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-values r 64 65
     ^done,register-values=[{number="64",value="0xfe00a300"},
     {number="65",value="0x00029002"}]
     (gdb)
     -data-list-register-values x
     ^done,register-values=[{number="0",value="0xfe0043c8"},
     {number="1",value="0x3fff88"},{number="2",value="0xfffffffe"},
     {number="3",value="0x0"},{number="4",value="0xa"},

The '-data-read-memory' Command
-------------------------------

This command is deprecated, use '-data-read-memory-bytes' instead.

Synopsis
........

      -data-read-memory [ -o BYTE-OFFSET ]
        ADDRESS WORD-FORMAT WORD-SIZE
        NR-ROWS NR-COLS [ ASCHAR ]

where:

'ADDRESS'
     An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be
     read.  Complex expressions containing embedded white space should
     be quoted using the C convention.

'WORD-FORMAT'
     The format to be used to print the memory words.  The notation is
     the same as for GDB's 'print' command (*note Output Formats: Output
     Formats.).

'WORD-SIZE'
     The size of each memory word in bytes.

'NR-ROWS'
     The number of rows in the output table.

'NR-COLS'
     The number of columns in the output table.

'ASCHAR'
     If present, indicates that each row should include an ASCII dump.
     The value of ASCHAR is used as a padding character when a byte is
     not a member of the printable ASCII character set (printable ASCII
     characters are those whose code is between 32 and 126,
     inclusively).

'BYTE-OFFSET'
     An offset to add to the ADDRESS before fetching memory.

   This command displays memory contents as a table of NR-ROWS by
NR-COLS words, each word being WORD-SIZE bytes.  In total, 'NR-ROWS *
NR-COLS * WORD-SIZE' bytes are read (returned as 'total-bytes').  Should
less than the requested number of bytes be returned by the target, the
missing words are identified using 'N/A'.  The number of bytes read from
the target is returned in 'nr-bytes' and the starting address used to
read memory in 'addr'.

   The address of the next/previous row or page is available in
'next-row' and 'prev-row', 'next-page' and 'prev-page'.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'x'.  'gdbtk' has 'gdb_get_mem' memory
read command.

Example
.......

Read six bytes of memory starting at 'bytes+6' but then offset by '-6'
bytes.  Format as three rows of two columns.  One byte per word.

The '-data-read-memory-bytes' Command
-------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-read-memory-bytes [ -o BYTE-OFFSET ]
        ADDRESS COUNT

where:

'ADDRESS'
     An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be
     read.  Complex expressions containing embedded white space should
     be quoted using the C convention.

'COUNT'
     The number of bytes to read.  This should be an integer literal.

'BYTE-OFFSET'
     The offsets in bytes relative to ADDRESS at which to start reading.
     This should be an integer literal.  This option is provided so that
     a frontend is not required to first evaluate address and then
     perform address arithmetics itself.

   This command attempts to read all accessible memory regions in the
specified range.  First, all regions marked as unreadable in the memory
map (if one is defined) will be skipped.  *Note Memory Region
Attributes::.  Second, GDB will attempt to read the remaining regions.
For each one, if reading full region results in an errors, GDB will try
to read a subset of the region.

   In general, every single byte in the region may be readable or not,
and the only way to read every readable byte is to try a read at every
address, which is not practical.  Therefore, GDB will attempt to read
all accessible bytes at either beginning or the end of the region, using
a binary division scheme.  This heuristic works well for reading accross
a memory map boundary.  Note that if a region has a readable range that
is neither at the beginning or the end, GDB will not read it.

   The result record (*note GDB/MI Result Records::) that is output of
the command includes a field named 'memory' whose content is a list of
tuples.  Each tuple represent a successfully read memory block and has
the following fields:

'begin'
     The start address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

'end'
     The end address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.

'offset'
     The offset of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal, relative to
     the start address passed to '-data-read-memory-bytes'.

'contents'
     The contents of the memory block, in hex.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'x'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -data-read-memory-bytes &a 10
     ^done,memory=[{begin="0xbffff154",offset="0x00000000",
                   end="0xbffff15e",
                   contents="01000000020000000300"}]
     (gdb)

The '-data-write-memory-bytes' Command
--------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -data-write-memory-bytes ADDRESS CONTENTS
      -data-write-memory-bytes ADDRESS CONTENTS [COUNT]

where:

'ADDRESS'
     An expression specifying the address of the first memory word to be
     read.  Complex expressions containing embedded white space should
     be quoted using the C convention.

'CONTENTS'
     The hex-encoded bytes to write.

'COUNT'
     Optional argument indicating the number of bytes to be written.  If
     COUNT is greater than CONTENTS' length, GDB will repeatedly write
     CONTENTS until it fills COUNT bytes.

GDB Command
...........

There's no corresponding GDB command.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -data-write-memory-bytes &a "aabbccdd"

27.17 GDB/MI Tracepoint Commands
================================

The commands defined in this section implement MI support for
tracepoints.  For detailed introduction, see *note Tracepoints::.

The '-trace-find' Command
-------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-find MODE [PARAMETERS...]

   Find a trace frame using criteria defined by MODE and PARAMETERS.
The following table lists permissible modes and their parameters.  For
details of operation, see *note tfind::.

'none'
     No parameters are required.  Stops examining trace frames.

'frame-number'
     An integer is required as parameter.  Selects tracepoint frame with
     that index.

'tracepoint-number'
     An integer is required as parameter.  Finds next trace frame that
     corresponds to tracepoint with the specified number.

'pc'
     An address is required as parameter.  Finds next trace frame that
     corresponds to any tracepoint at the specified address.

'pc-inside-range'
     Two addresses are required as parameters.  Finds next trace frame
     that corresponds to a tracepoint at an address inside the specified
     range.  Both bounds are considered to be inside the range.

'pc-outside-range'
     Two addresses are required as parameters.  Finds next trace frame
     that corresponds to a tracepoint at an address outside the
     specified range.  Both bounds are considered to be inside the
     range.

'line'
     Line specification is required as parameter.  *Note Specify
     Location::.  Finds next trace frame that corresponds to a
     tracepoint at the specified location.

   If 'none' was passed as MODE, the response does not have fields.
Otherwise, the response may have the following fields:

'found'
     This field has either '0' or '1' as the value, depending on whether
     a matching tracepoint was found.

'traceframe'
     The index of the found traceframe.  This field is present iff the
     'found' field has value of '1'.

'tracepoint'
     The index of the found tracepoint.  This field is present iff the
     'found' field has value of '1'.

'frame'
     The information about the frame corresponding to the found trace
     frame.  This field is present only if a trace frame was found.
     *Note GDB/MI Frame Information::, for description of this field.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tfind'.

-trace-define-variable
----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-define-variable NAME [ VALUE ]

   Create trace variable NAME if it does not exist.  If VALUE is
specified, sets the initial value of the specified trace variable to
that value.  Note that the NAME should start with the '$' character.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tvariable'.

The '-trace-frame-collected' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-frame-collected
         [--var-print-values VAR_PVAL]
         [--comp-print-values COMP_PVAL]
         [--registers-format REGFORMAT]
         [--memory-contents]

   This command returns the set of collected objects, register names,
trace state variable names, memory ranges and computed expressions that
have been collected at a particular trace frame.  The optional
parameters to the command affect the output format in different ways.
See the output description table below for more details.

   The reported names can be used in the normal manner to create varobjs
and inspect the objects themselves.  The items returned by this command
are categorized so that it is clear which is a variable, which is a
register, which is a trace state variable, which is a memory range and
which is a computed expression.

   For instance, if the actions were
     collect myVar, myArray[myIndex], myObj.field, myPtr->field, myCount + 2
     collect *(int*)0xaf02bef0@40

the object collected in its entirety would be 'myVar'.  The object
'myArray' would be partially collected, because only the element at
index 'myIndex' would be collected.  The remaining objects would be
computed expressions.

   An example output would be:

     (gdb)
     -trace-frame-collected
     ^done,
       explicit-variables=[{name="myVar",value="1"}],
       computed-expressions=[{name="myArray[myIndex]",value="0"},
                             {name="myObj.field",value="0"},
                             {name="myPtr->field",value="1"},
                             {name="myCount + 2",value="3"},
                             {name="$tvar1 + 1",value="43970027"}],
       registers=[{number="0",value="0x7fe2c6e79ec8"},
                  {number="1",value="0x0"},
                  {number="2",value="0x4"},
                  ...
                  {number="125",value="0x0"}],
       tvars=[{name="$tvar1",current="43970026"}],
       memory=[{address="0x0000000000602264",length="4"},
               {address="0x0000000000615bc0",length="4"}]
     (gdb)

   Where:

'explicit-variables'
     The set of objects that have been collected in their entirety (as
     opposed to collecting just a few elements of an array or a few
     struct members).  For each object, its name and value are printed.
     The '--var-print-values' option affects how or whether the value
     field is output.  If VAR_PVAL is 0, then print only the names; if
     it is 1, print also their values; and if it is 2, print the name,
     type and value for simple data types, and the name and type for
     arrays, structures and unions.

'computed-expressions'
     The set of computed expressions that have been collected at the
     current trace frame.  The '--comp-print-values' option affects this
     set like the '--var-print-values' option affects the
     'explicit-variables' set.  See above.

'registers'
     The registers that have been collected at the current trace frame.
     For each register collected, the name and current value are
     returned.  The value is formatted according to the
     '--registers-format' option.  See the '-data-list-register-values'
     command for a list of the allowed formats.  The default is 'x'.

'tvars'
     The trace state variables that have been collected at the current
     trace frame.  For each trace state variable collected, the name and
     current value are returned.

'memory'
     The set of memory ranges that have been collected at the current
     trace frame.  Its content is a list of tuples.  Each tuple
     represents a collected memory range and has the following fields:

     'address'
          The start address of the memory range, as hexadecimal literal.

     'length'
          The length of the memory range, as decimal literal.

     'contents'
          The contents of the memory block, in hex.  This field is only
          present if the '--memory-contents' option is specified.

GDB Command
...........

There is no corresponding GDB command.

Example
.......

-trace-list-variables
---------------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-list-variables

   Return a table of all defined trace variables.  Each element of the
table has the following fields:

'name'
     The name of the trace variable.  This field is always present.

'initial'
     The initial value.  This is a 64-bit signed integer.  This field is
     always present.

'current'
     The value the trace variable has at the moment.  This is a 64-bit
     signed integer.  This field is absent iff current value is not
     defined, for example if the trace was never run, or is presently
     running.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tvariables'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -trace-list-variables
     ^done,trace-variables={nr_rows="1",nr_cols="3",
     hdr=[{width="15",alignment="-1",col_name="name",colhdr="Name"},
          {width="11",alignment="-1",col_name="initial",colhdr="Initial"},
          {width="11",alignment="-1",col_name="current",colhdr="Current"}],
     body=[variable={name="$trace_timestamp",initial="0"}
           variable={name="$foo",initial="10",current="15"}]}
     (gdb)

-trace-save
-----------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-save [-r ] FILENAME

   Saves the collected trace data to FILENAME.  Without the '-r' option,
the data is downloaded from the target and saved in a local file.  With
the '-r' option the target is asked to perform the save.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tsave'.

-trace-start
------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-start

   Starts a tracing experiments.  The result of this command does not
have any fields.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tstart'.

-trace-status
-------------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-status

   Obtains the status of a tracing experiment.  The result may include
the following fields:

'supported'
     May have a value of either '0', when no tracing operations are
     supported, '1', when all tracing operations are supported, or
     'file' when examining trace file.  In the latter case, examining of
     trace frame is possible but new tracing experiement cannot be
     started.  This field is always present.

'running'
     May have a value of either '0' or '1' depending on whether tracing
     experiement is in progress on target.  This field is present if
     'supported' field is not '0'.

'stop-reason'
     Report the reason why the tracing was stopped last time.  This
     field may be absent iff tracing was never stopped on target yet.
     The value of 'request' means the tracing was stopped as result of
     the '-trace-stop' command.  The value of 'overflow' means the
     tracing buffer is full.  The value of 'disconnection' means tracing
     was automatically stopped when GDB has disconnected.  The value of
     'passcount' means tracing was stopped when a tracepoint was passed
     a maximal number of times for that tracepoint.  This field is
     present if 'supported' field is not '0'.

'stopping-tracepoint'
     The number of tracepoint whose passcount as exceeded.  This field
     is present iff the 'stop-reason' field has the value of
     'passcount'.

'frames'
'frames-created'
     The 'frames' field is a count of the total number of trace frames
     in the trace buffer, while 'frames-created' is the total created
     during the run, including ones that were discarded, such as when a
     circular trace buffer filled up.  Both fields are optional.

'buffer-size'
'buffer-free'
     These fields tell the current size of the tracing buffer and the
     remaining space.  These fields are optional.

'circular'
     The value of the circular trace buffer flag.  '1' means that the
     trace buffer is circular and old trace frames will be discarded if
     necessary to make room, '0' means that the trace buffer is linear
     and may fill up.

'disconnected'
     The value of the disconnected tracing flag.  '1' means that tracing
     will continue after GDB disconnects, '0' means that the trace run
     will stop.

'trace-file'
     The filename of the trace file being examined.  This field is
     optional, and only present when examining a trace file.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tstatus'.

-trace-stop
-----------

Synopsis
........

      -trace-stop

   Stops a tracing experiment.  The result of this command has the same
fields as '-trace-status', except that the 'supported' and 'running'
fields are not output.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'tstop'.

27.19 GDB/MI File Commands
==========================

This section describes the GDB/MI commands to specify executable file
names and to read in and obtain symbol table information.

The '-file-exec-and-symbols' Command
------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-exec-and-symbols FILE

   Specify the executable file to be debugged.  This file is the one
from which the symbol table is also read.  If no file is specified, the
command clears the executable and symbol information.  If breakpoints
are set when using this command with no arguments, GDB will produce
error messages.  Otherwise, no output is produced, except a completion
notification.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'file'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -file-exec-and-symbols /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/TRUNK/mbx/hello.mbx
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-file-exec-file' Command
-----------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-exec-file FILE

   Specify the executable file to be debugged.  Unlike
'-file-exec-and-symbols', the symbol table is _not_ read from this file.
If used without argument, GDB clears the information about the
executable file.  No output is produced, except a completion
notification.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'exec-file'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -file-exec-file /kwikemart/marge/ezannoni/TRUNK/mbx/hello.mbx
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-file-list-exec-source-file' Command
-----------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-list-exec-source-file

   List the line number, the current source file, and the absolute path
to the current source file for the current executable.  The macro
information field has a value of '1' or '0' depending on whether or not
the file includes preprocessor macro information.

GDB Command
...........

The GDB equivalent is 'info source'

Example

The '-file-list-exec-source-files' Command
------------------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -file-list-exec-source-files

   List the source files for the current executable.

   It will always output both the filename and fullname (absolute file
name) of a source file.

GDB Command
...........

The GDB equivalent is 'info sources'.  'gdbtk' has an analogous command
'gdb_listfiles'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -file-list-exec-source-files
     ^done,files=[
     {file=foo.c,fullname=/home/foo.c},

27.23 GDB/MI Support Commands
=============================

Since new commands and features get regularly added to GDB/MI, some
commands are available to help front-ends query the debugger about
support for these capabilities.  Similarly, it is also possible to query
GDB about target support of certain features.

The '-info-gdb-mi-command' Command
----------------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -info-gdb-mi-command CMD_NAME

   Query support for the GDB/MI command named CMD_NAME.

   Note that the dash ('-') starting all GDB/MI commands is technically
not part of the command name (*note GDB/MI Input Syntax::), and thus
should be omitted in CMD_NAME.  However, for ease of use, this command
also accepts the form with the leading dash.

GDB Command
...........

There is no corresponding GDB command.

Result
......

The result is a tuple.  There is currently only one field:

'exists'
     This field is equal to '"true"' if the GDB/MI command exists,
     '"false"' otherwise.

Example
.......

Here is an example where the GDB/MI command does not exist:

     -info-gdb-mi-command unsupported-command
     ^done,command={exists="false"}

And here is an example where the GDB/MI command is known to the
debugger:

     -info-gdb-mi-command symbol-list-lines
     ^done,command={exists="true"}

The '-list-features' Command
----------------------------

Returns a list of particular features of the MI protocol that this
version of gdb implements.  A feature can be a command, or a new field
in an output of some command, or even an important bugfix.  While a
frontend can sometimes detect presence of a feature at runtime, it is
easier to perform detection at debugger startup.

   The command returns a list of strings, with each string naming an
available feature.  Each returned string is just a name, it does not
have any internal structure.  The list of possible feature names is
given below.

   Example output:

     (gdb) -list-features
     ^done,result=["feature1","feature2"]

   The current list of features is:

'frozen-varobjs'
     Indicates support for the '-var-set-frozen' command, as well as
     possible presense of the 'frozen' field in the output of
     '-varobj-create'.
'pending-breakpoints'
     Indicates support for the '-f' option to the '-break-insert'
     command.
'python'
     Indicates Python scripting support, Python-based pretty-printing
     commands, and possible presence of the 'display_hint' field in the
     output of '-var-list-children'
'thread-info'
     Indicates support for the '-thread-info' command.
'data-read-memory-bytes'
     Indicates support for the '-data-read-memory-bytes' and the
     '-data-write-memory-bytes' commands.
'breakpoint-notifications'
     Indicates that changes to breakpoints and breakpoints created via
     the CLI will be announced via async records.
'ada-task-info'
     Indicates support for the '-ada-task-info' command.
'language-option'
     Indicates that all GDB/MI commands accept the '--language' option
     (*note Context management::).
'info-gdb-mi-command'
     Indicates support for the '-info-gdb-mi-command' command.
'undefined-command-error-code'
     Indicates support for the "undefined-command" error code in error
     result records, produced when trying to execute an undefined GDB/MI
     command (*note GDB/MI Result Records::).
'exec-run-start-option'
     Indicates that the '-exec-run' command supports the '--start'
     option (*note GDB/MI Program Execution::).

The '-list-target-features' Command
-----------------------------------

Returns a list of particular features that are supported by the target.
Those features affect the permitted MI commands, but unlike the features
reported by the '-list-features' command, the features depend on which
target GDB is using at the moment.  Whenever a target can change, due to
commands such as '-target-select', '-target-attach' or '-exec-run', the
list of target features may change, and the frontend should obtain it
again.  Example output:

     (gdb) -list-target-features
     ^done,result=["async"]

   The current list of features is:

'async'
     Indicates that the target is capable of asynchronous command
     execution, which means that GDB will accept further commands while
     the target is running.

'reverse'
     Indicates that the target is capable of reverse execution.  *Note
     Reverse Execution::, for more information.

27.24 Miscellaneous GDB/MI Commands
===================================

The '-gdb-exit' Command
-----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-exit

   Exit GDB immediately.

GDB Command
...........

Approximately corresponds to 'quit'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-exit
     ^exit

The '-gdb-set' Command
----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-set

   Set an internal GDB variable.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'set'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-set $foo=3
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-gdb-show' Command
-----------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-show

   Show the current value of a GDB variable.

GDB Command
...........

The corresponding GDB command is 'show'.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-show annotate
     ^done,value="0"
     (gdb)

The '-gdb-version' Command
--------------------------

Synopsis
........

      -gdb-version

   Show version information for GDB.  Used mostly in testing.

GDB Command
...........

The GDB equivalent is 'show version'.  GDB by default shows this
information when you start an interactive session.

Example
.......

     (gdb)
     -gdb-version
     ~GNU gdb 5.2.1
     ~Copyright 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     ~GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and
     ~you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under
     ~ certain conditions.
     ~Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
     ~There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for
     ~ details.
     ~This GDB was configured as
      "--host=sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1 --target=ppc-eabi".
     ^done
     (gdb)

The '-list-thread-groups' Command
---------------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -list-thread-groups [ --available ] [ --recurse 1 ] [ GROUP ... ]

   Lists thread groups (*note Thread groups::).  When a single thread
group is passed as the argument, lists the children of that group.  When
several thread group are passed, lists information about those thread
groups.  Without any parameters, lists information about all top-level
thread groups.

   Normally, thread groups that are being debugged are reported.  With
the '--available' option, GDB reports thread groups available on the
target.

   The output of this command may have either a 'threads' result or a
'groups' result.  The 'thread' result has a list of tuples as value,
with each tuple describing a thread (*note GDB/MI Thread Information::).
The 'groups' result has a list of tuples as value, each tuple describing
a thread group.  If top-level groups are requested (that is, no
parameter is passed), or when several groups are passed, the output
always has a 'groups' result.  The format of the 'group' result is
described below.

   To reduce the number of roundtrips it's possible to list thread
groups together with their children, by passing the '--recurse' option
and the recursion depth.  Presently, only recursion depth of 1 is
permitted.  If this option is present, then every reported thread group
will also include its children, either as 'group' or 'threads' field.

   In general, any combination of option and parameters is permitted,
with the following caveats:

   * When a single thread group is passed, the output will typically be
     the 'threads' result.  Because threads may not contain anything,
     the 'recurse' option will be ignored.

   * When the '--available' option is passed, limited information may be
     available.  In particular, the list of threads of a process might
     be inaccessible.  Further, specifying specific thread groups might
     not give any performance advantage over listing all thread groups.
     The frontend should assume that '-list-thread-groups --available'
     is always an expensive operation and cache the results.

   The 'groups' result is a list of tuples, where each tuple may have
the following fields:

'id'
     Identifier of the thread group.  This field is always present.  The
     identifier is an opaque string; frontends should not try to convert
     it to an integer, even though it might look like one.

'type'
     The type of the thread group.  At present, only 'process' is a
     valid type.

'pid'
     The target-specific process identifier.  This field is only present
     for thread groups of type 'process' and only if the process exists.

'num_children'
     The number of children this thread group has.  This field may be
     absent for an available thread group.

'threads'
     This field has a list of tuples as value, each tuple describing a
     thread.  It may be present if the '--recurse' option is specified,
     and it's actually possible to obtain the threads.

'cores'
     This field is a list of integers, each identifying a core that one
     thread of the group is running on.  This field may be absent if
     such information is not available.

'executable'
     The name of the executable file that corresponds to this thread
     group.  The field is only present for thread groups of type
     'process', and only if there is a corresponding executable file.

Example
-------

     gdb
     -list-thread-groups
     ^done,groups=[{id="17",type="process",pid="yyy",num_children="2"}]
     -list-thread-groups 17
     ^done,threads=[{id="2",target-id="Thread 0xb7e14b90 (LWP 21257)",

                file="/tmp/a.c",fullname="/tmp/a.c",line="158"},state="running"}]]
     -list-thread-groups --available

                             {id="2",target-id="Thread 0xb7e14b90",cores=[2]}]},...]

The '-info-os' Command
----------------------

Synopsis
........

     -info-os [ TYPE ]

   If no argument is supplied, the command returns a table of available
operating-system-specific information types.  If one of these types is
supplied as an argument TYPE, then the command returns a table of data
of that type.

   The types of information available depend on the target operating
system.

   (Note that the MI output here includes a '"Title"' column that does
not appear in command-line 'info os'; this column is useful for MI
clients that want to enumerate the types of data, such as in a popup
menu, but is needless clutter on the command line, and 'info os' omits
it.)

The '-add-inferior' Command
---------------------------

Synopsis
--------

     -add-inferior

   Creates a new inferior (*note Inferiors and Programs::).  The created
inferior is not associated with any executable.  Such association may be
established with the '-file-exec-and-symbols' command (*note GDB/MI File
Commands::).  The command response has a single field, 'inferior', whose
value is the identifier of the thread group corresponding to the new
inferior.

28 GDB Annotations
******************

This chapter describes annotations in GDB.  Annotations were designed to
interface GDB to graphical user interfaces or other similar programs
which want to interact with GDB at a relatively high level.

   The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by GDB/MI (*note
GDB/MI::).

* Menu:

* Annotations Overview::  What annotations are; the general syntax.
* Server Prefix::       Issuing a command without affecting user state.
* Prompting::           Annotations marking GDB's need for input.
* Errors::              Annotations for error messages.
* Invalidation::        Some annotations describe things now invalid.
* Annotations for Running::
                        Whether the program is running, how it stopped, etc.
* Source Annotations::  Annotations describing source code.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Annotations Overview,  Next: Server Prefix,  Up: Annotations

28.1 What is an Annotation?
===========================

Annotations start with a newline character, two 'control-z' characters,
and the name of the annotation.  If there is no additional information
associated with this annotation, the name of the annotation is followed
immediately by a newline.  If there is additional information, the name
of the annotation is followed by a space, the additional information,
and a newline.  The additional information cannot contain newline
characters.

   Any output not beginning with a newline and two 'control-z'
characters denotes literal output from GDB.  Currently there is no need
for GDB to output a newline followed by two 'control-z' characters, but
if there was such a need, the annotations could be extended with an
'escape' annotation which means those three characters as output.

   The annotation LEVEL, which is specified using the '--annotate'
command line option (*note Mode Options::), controls how much
information GDB prints together with its prompt, values of expressions,
source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0 is for no annotations,
level 1 is for use when GDB is run as a subprocess of GNU Emacs, level 3
is the maximum annotation suitable for programs that control GDB, and
level 2 annotations have been made obsolete (*note Limitations of the
Annotation Interface: (annotate)Limitations.).

'set annotate LEVEL'
     The GDB command 'set annotate' sets the level of annotations to the
     specified LEVEL.

'show annotate'
     Show the current annotation level.

   This chapter describes level 3 annotations.

   A simple example of starting up GDB with annotations is:

     $ gdb --annotate=3
     GNU gdb 6.0
     Copyright 2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License,
     and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it
     under certain conditions.
     Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
     There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty"
     for details.
     This GDB was configured as "i386-pc-linux-gnu"

     ^Z^Zpre-prompt
     (gdb)
     ^Z^Zprompt
     quit

     ^Z^Zpost-prompt
     $

   Here 'quit' is input to GDB; the rest is output from GDB.  The three
lines beginning '^Z^Z' (where '^Z' denotes a 'control-z' character) are
annotations; the rest is output from GDB.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Server Prefix,  Next: Prompting,  Prev: Annotations Overview,  Up: Annotations

28.2 The Server Prefix
======================

If you prefix a command with 'server ' then it will not affect the
command history, nor will it affect GDB's notion of which command to
repeat if <RET> is pressed on a line by itself.  This means that
commands can be run behind a user's back by a front-end in a transparent
manner.

   The 'server ' prefix does not affect the recording of values into the
value history; to print a value without recording it into the value
history, use the 'output' command instead of the 'print' command.

   Using this prefix also disables confirmation requests (*note
confirmation requests::).


File: gdb.info,  Node: Prompting,  Next: Errors,  Prev: Server Prefix,  Up: Annotations

28.3 Annotation for GDB Input
=============================

When GDB prompts for input, it annotates this fact so it is possible to
know when to send output, when the output from a given command is over,
etc.

   Different kinds of input each have a different "input type".  Each
input type has three annotations: a 'pre-' annotation, which denotes the
beginning of any prompt which is being output, a plain annotation, which
denotes the end of the prompt, and then a 'post-' annotation which
denotes the end of any echo which may (or may not) be associated with
the input.  For example, the 'prompt' input type features the following
annotations:

     ^Z^Zpre-prompt
     ^Z^Zprompt
     ^Z^Zpost-prompt

   The input types are

'prompt'
     When GDB is prompting for a command (the main GDB prompt).

'commands'
     When GDB prompts for a set of commands, like in the 'commands'
     command.  The annotations are repeated for each command which is
     input.

'overload-choice'
     When GDB wants the user to select between various overloaded
     functions.

'query'
     When GDB wants the user to confirm a potentially dangerous
     operation.

'prompt-for-continue'
     When GDB is asking the user to press return to continue.  Note:
     Don't expect this to work well; instead use 'set height 0' to
     disable prompting.  This is because the counting of lines is buggy
     in the presence of annotations.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Errors,  Next: Invalidation,  Prev: Prompting,  Up: Annotations

28.4 Errors
===========

     ^Z^Zquit

   This annotation occurs right before GDB responds to an interrupt.

     ^Z^Zerror

   This annotation occurs right before GDB responds to an error.

   Quit and error annotations indicate that any annotations which GDB
was in the middle of may end abruptly.  For example, if a
'value-history-begin' annotation is followed by a 'error', one cannot
expect to receive the matching 'value-history-end'.  One cannot expect
not to receive it either, however; an error annotation does not
necessarily mean that GDB is immediately returning all the way to the
top level.

   A quit or error annotation may be preceded by

     ^Z^Zerror-begin

   Any output between that and the quit or error annotation is the error
message.

   Warning messages are not yet annotated.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Invalidation,  Next: Annotations for Running,  Prev: Errors,  Up: Annotations

28.5 Invalidation Notices
=========================

The following annotations say that certain pieces of state may have
changed.

'^Z^Zframes-invalid'

     The frames (for example, output from the 'backtrace' command) may
     have changed.

'^Z^Zbreakpoints-invalid'

     The breakpoints may have changed.  For example, the user just added
     or deleted a breakpoint.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Annotations for Running,  Next: Source Annotations,  Prev: Invalidation,  Up: Annotations

28.6 Running the Program
========================

When the program starts executing due to a GDB command such as 'step' or
'continue',

     ^Z^Zstarting

   is output.  When the program stops,

     ^Z^Zstopped

   is output.  Before the 'stopped' annotation, a variety of annotations
describe how the program stopped.

'^Z^Zexited EXIT-STATUS'
     The program exited, and EXIT-STATUS is the exit status (zero for
     successful exit, otherwise nonzero).

'^Z^Zsignalled'
     The program exited with a signal.  After the '^Z^Zsignalled', the
     annotation continues:

          INTRO-TEXT
          ^Z^Zsignal-name
          NAME
          ^Z^Zsignal-name-end
          MIDDLE-TEXT
          ^Z^Zsignal-string
          STRING
          ^Z^Zsignal-string-end
          END-TEXT

     where NAME is the name of the signal, such as 'SIGILL' or
     'SIGSEGV', and STRING is the explanation of the signal, such as
     'Illegal Instruction' or 'Segmentation fault'.  The arguments
     INTRO-TEXT, MIDDLE-TEXT, and END-TEXT are for the user's benefit
     and have no particular format.

'^Z^Zsignal'
     The syntax of this annotation is just like 'signalled', but GDB is
     just saying that the program received the signal, not that it was
     terminated with it.

'^Z^Zbreakpoint NUMBER'
     The program hit breakpoint number NUMBER.

'^Z^Zwatchpoint NUMBER'
     The program hit watchpoint number NUMBER.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Source Annotations,  Prev: Annotations for Running,  Up: Annotations

28.7 Displaying Source
======================

The following annotation is used instead of displaying source code:

     ^Z^Zsource FILENAME:LINE:CHARACTER:MIDDLE:ADDR

   where FILENAME is an absolute file name indicating which source file,
LINE is the line number within that file (where 1 is the first line in
the file), CHARACTER is the character position within the file (where 0
is the first character in the file) (for most debug formats this will
necessarily point to the beginning of a line), MIDDLE is 'middle' if
ADDR is in the middle of the line, or 'beg' if ADDR is at the beginning
of the line, and ADDR is the address in the target program associated
with the source which is being displayed.  The ADDR is in the form '0x'
followed by one or more lowercase hex digits (note that this does not
depend on the language).

29 JIT Compilation Interface
****************************

This chapter documents GDB's "just-in-time" (JIT) compilation interface.
A JIT compiler is a program or library that generates native executable
code at runtime and executes it, usually in order to achieve good
performance while maintaining platform independence.

   Programs that use JIT compilation are normally difficult to debug
because portions of their code are generated at runtime, instead of
being loaded from object files, which is where GDB normally finds the
program's symbols and debug information.  In order to debug programs
that use JIT compilation, GDB has an interface that allows the program
to register in-memory symbol files with GDB at runtime.

   If you are using GDB to debug a program that uses this interface,
then it should work transparently so long as you have not stripped the
binary.  If you are developing a JIT compiler, then the interface is
documented in the rest of this chapter.  At this time, the only known
client of this interface is the LLVM JIT.

   Broadly speaking, the JIT interface mirrors the dynamic loader
interface.  The JIT compiler communicates with GDB by writing data into
a global variable and calling a fuction at a well-known symbol.  When
GDB attaches, it reads a linked list of symbol files from the global
variable to find existing code, and puts a breakpoint in the function so
that it can find out about additional code.

* Custom Debug Info::           Emit debug information in a custom format


File: gdb.info,  Node: Declarations,  Next: Registering Code,  Up: JIT Interface

29.1 JIT Declarations
=====================

These are the relevant struct declarations that a C program should
include to implement the interface:

     typedef enum
     {
       JIT_NOACTION = 0,
       JIT_REGISTER_FN,
       JIT_UNREGISTER_FN
     } jit_actions_t;

     struct jit_code_entry
     {
       struct jit_code_entry *next_entry;
       struct jit_code_entry *prev_entry;
       const char *symfile_addr;
       uint64_t symfile_size;
     };

     struct jit_descriptor
     {
       uint32_t version;
       /* This type should be jit_actions_t, but we use uint32_t
          to be explicit about the bitwidth.  */
       uint32_t action_flag;
       struct jit_code_entry *relevant_entry;
       struct jit_code_entry *first_entry;
     };

     /* GDB puts a breakpoint in this function.  */
     void __attribute__((noinline)) __jit_debug_register_code() { };

     /* Make sure to specify the version statically, because the
        debugger may check the version before we can set it.  */
     struct jit_descriptor __jit_debug_descriptor = { 1, 0, 0, 0 };

   If the JIT is multi-threaded, then it is important that the JIT
synchronize any modifications to this global data properly, which can
easily be done by putting a global mutex around modifications to these
structures.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Registering Code,  Next: Unregistering Code,  Prev: Declarations,  Up: JIT Interface

29.2 Registering Code
=====================

To register code with GDB, the JIT should follow this protocol:

   * Generate an object file in memory with symbols and other desired
     debug information.  The file must include the virtual addresses of
     the sections.

   * Create a code entry for the file, which gives the start and size of
     the symbol file.

   * Add it to the linked list in the JIT descriptor.

   * Point the relevant_entry field of the descriptor at the entry.

   * Set 'action_flag' to 'JIT_REGISTER' and call
     '__jit_debug_register_code'.

   When GDB is attached and the breakpoint fires, GDB uses the
'relevant_entry' pointer so it doesn't have to walk the list looking for
new code.  However, the linked list must still be maintained in order to
allow GDB to attach to a running process and still find the symbol
files.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Unregistering Code,  Next: Custom Debug Info,  Prev: Registering Code,  Up: JIT Interface

29.3 Unregistering Code
=======================

If code is freed, then the JIT should use the following protocol:

   * Remove the code entry corresponding to the code from the linked
     list.

   * Point the 'relevant_entry' field of the descriptor at the code
     entry.

   * Set 'action_flag' to 'JIT_UNREGISTER' and call
     '__jit_debug_register_code'.

   If the JIT frees or recompiles code without unregistering it, then
GDB and the JIT will leak the memory used for the associated symbol
files.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Custom Debug Info,  Prev: Unregistering Code,  Up: JIT Interface

29.4 Custom Debug Info
======================

Generating debug information in platform-native file formats (like ELF
or COFF) may be an overkill for JIT compilers; especially if all the
debug info is used for is displaying a meaningful backtrace.  The issue
can be resolved by having the JIT writers decide on a debug info format
and also provide a reader that parses the debug info generated by the
JIT compiler.  This section gives a brief overview on writing such a
parser.  More specific details can be found in the source file
'gdb/jit-reader.in', which is also installed as a header at
'INCLUDEDIR/gdb/jit-reader.h' for easy inclusion.

   The reader is implemented as a shared object (so this functionality
is not available on platforms which don't allow loading shared objects
at runtime).  Two GDB commands, 'jit-reader-load' and
'jit-reader-unload' are provided, to be used to load and unload the
readers from a preconfigured directory.  Once loaded, the shared object
is used the parse the debug information emitted by the JIT compiler.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Using JIT Debug Info Readers,  Next: Writing JIT Debug Info Readers,  Up: Custom Debug Info

29.4.1 Using JIT Debug Info Readers
-----------------------------------

Readers can be loaded and unloaded using the 'jit-reader-load' and
'jit-reader-unload' commands.

'jit-reader-load READER'
     Load the JIT reader named READER, which is a shared object
     specified as either an absolute or a relative file name.  In the
     latter case, GDB will try to load the reader from a pre-configured
     directory, usually 'LIBDIR/gdb/' on a UNIX system (here LIBDIR is
     the system library directory, often '/usr/local/lib').

     Only one reader can be active at a time; trying to load a second
     reader when one is already loaded will result in GDB reporting an
     error.  A new JIT reader can be loaded by first unloading the
     current one using 'jit-reader-unload' and then invoking
     'jit-reader-load'.

'jit-reader-unload'
     Unload the currently loaded JIT reader.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Writing JIT Debug Info Readers,  Prev: Using JIT Debug Info Readers,  Up: Custom Debug Info

29.4.2 Writing JIT Debug Info Readers
-------------------------------------

As mentioned, a reader is essentially a shared object conforming to a
certain ABI. This ABI is described in 'jit-reader.h'.

   'jit-reader.h' defines the structures, macros and functions required
to write a reader.  It is installed (along with GDB), in
'INCLUDEDIR/gdb' where INCLUDEDIR is the system include directory.

   Readers need to be released under a GPL compatible license.  A reader
can be declared as released under such a license by placing the macro
'GDB_DECLARE_GPL_COMPATIBLE_READER' in a source file.

   The entry point for readers is the symbol 'gdb_init_reader', which is
expected to be a function with the prototype

     extern struct gdb_reader_funcs *gdb_init_reader (void);

   'struct gdb_reader_funcs' contains a set of pointers to callback
functions.  These functions are executed to read the debug info
generated by the JIT compiler ('read'), to unwind stack frames
('unwind') and to create canonical frame IDs ('get_Frame_id').  It also
has a callback that is called when the reader is being unloaded
('destroy').  The struct looks like this

     struct gdb_reader_funcs
     {
       /* Must be set to GDB_READER_INTERFACE_VERSION.  */
       int reader_version;

       /* For use by the reader.  */
       void *priv_data;

       gdb_read_debug_info *read;
       gdb_unwind_frame *unwind;
       gdb_get_frame_id *get_frame_id;
       gdb_destroy_reader *destroy;
     };

   The callbacks are provided with another set of callbacks by GDB to do
their job.  For 'read', these callbacks are passed in a 'struct
gdb_symbol_callbacks' and for 'unwind' and 'get_frame_id', in a 'struct
gdb_unwind_callbacks'.  'struct gdb_symbol_callbacks' has callbacks to
create new object files and new symbol tables inside those object files.
'struct gdb_unwind_callbacks' has callbacks to read registers off the
current frame and to write out the values of the registers in the
previous frame.  Both have a callback ('target_read') to read bytes off
the target's address space.

30 In-Process Agent
*******************

The traditional debugging model is conceptually low-speed, but works
fine, because most bugs can be reproduced in debugging-mode execution.
However, as multi-core or many-core processors are becoming mainstream,
and multi-threaded programs become more and more popular, there should
be more and more bugs that only manifest themselves at normal-mode
execution, for example, thread races, because debugger's interference
with the program's timing may conceal the bugs.  On the other hand, in
some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt the
program's execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to
be able to observe the program's behavior without interrupting it.

   Therefore, traditional debugging model is too intrusive to reproduce
some bugs.  In order to reduce the interference with the program, we can
reduce the number of operations performed by debugger.  The "In-Process
Agent", a shared library, is running within the same process with
inferior, and is able to perform some debugging operations itself.  As a
result, debugger is only involved when necessary, and performance of
debugging can be improved accordingly.  Note that interference with
program can be reduced but can't be removed completely, because the
in-process agent will still stop or slow down the program.

   The in-process agent can interpret and execute Agent Expressions
(*note Agent Expressions::) during performing debugging operations.  The
agent expressions can be used for different purposes, such as collecting
data in tracepoints, and condition evaluation in breakpoints.

   You can control whether the in-process agent is used as an aid for
debugging with the following commands:

'set agent on'
     Causes the in-process agent to perform some operations on behalf of
     the debugger.  Just which operations requested by the user will be
     done by the in-process agent depends on the its capabilities.  For
     example, if you request to evaluate breakpoint conditions in the
     in-process agent, and the in-process agent has such capability as
     well, then breakpoint conditions will be evaluated in the
     in-process agent.

'set agent off'
     Disables execution of debugging operations by the in-process agent.

30.1 In-Process Agent Protocol
==============================

The in-process agent is able to communicate with both GDB and GDBserver
(*note In-Process Agent::).  This section documents the protocol used
for communications between GDB or GDBserver and the IPA. In general, GDB
or GDBserver sends commands (*note IPA Protocol Commands::) and data to
in-process agent, and then in-process agent replies back with the return
result of the command, or some other information.  The data sent to
in-process agent is composed of primitive data types, such as 4-byte or
8-byte type, and composite types, which are called objects (*note IPA
Protocol Objects::).

* Menu:

* IPA Protocol Objects::
* IPA Protocol Commands::


File: gdb.info,  Node: IPA Protocol Objects,  Next: IPA Protocol Commands,  Up: In-Process Agent Protocol

30.1.1 IPA Protocol Objects
---------------------------

The commands sent to and results received from agent may contain some
complex data types called "objects".

   The in-process agent is running on the same machine with GDB or
GDBserver, so it doesn't have to handle as much differences between two
ends as remote protocol (*note Remote Protocol::) tries to handle.
However, there are still some differences of two ends in two processes:

  1. word size.  On some 64-bit machines, GDB or GDBserver can be
     compiled as a 64-bit executable, while in-process agent is a 32-bit
     one.
  2. ABI. Some machines may have multiple types of ABI, GDB or GDBserver
     is compiled with one, and in-process agent is compiled with the
     other one.

   Here are the IPA Protocol Objects:

  1. agent expression object.  It represents an agent expression (*note
     Agent Expressions::).
  2. tracepoint action object.  It represents a tracepoint action (*note
     Tracepoint Action Lists: Tracepoint Actions.) to collect registers,
     memory, static trace data and to evaluate expression.
  3. tracepoint object.  It represents a tracepoint (*note
     Tracepoints::).

   The following table describes important attributes of each IPA
protocol object:

'FastTrace:TRACEPOINT_OBJECT GDB_JUMP_PAD_HEAD'
     Installs a new fast tracepoint described by TRACEPOINT_OBJECT
     (*note tracepoint object::).  The GDB_JUMP_PAD_HEAD, 8-byte long,
     is the head of "jumppad", which is used to jump to data collection
     routine in IPA finally.

     Replies:
     'OK TARGET_ADDRESS GDB_JUMP_PAD_HEAD FJUMP_SIZE FJUMP'
          TARGET_ADDRESS is address of tracepoint in the inferior.  The
          GDB_JUMP_PAD_HEAD is updated head of jumppad.  Both of
          TARGET_ADDRESS and GDB_JUMP_PAD_HEAD are 8-byte long.  The
          FJUMP contains a sequence of instructions jump to jumppad
          entry.  The FJUMP_SIZE, 4-byte long, is the size of FJUMP.
     'E NN'
          for an error

'close'
     Closes the in-process agent.  This command is sent when GDB or
     GDBserver is about to kill inferiors.

31 Reporting Bugs in GDB
************************

Your bug reports play an essential role in making GDB reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of GDB work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of GDB.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::                Have you found a bug?
* Bug Reporting::               How to report bugs


File: gdb.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: GDB Bugs

31.1 Have You Found a Bug?
==========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the debugger gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a GDB bug.  Reliable debuggers never crash.

   * If GDB produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.
     (Note that if you're cross debugging, the problem may also be
     somewhere in the connection to the target.)

   * If GDB does not produce an error message for invalid input, that is
     a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid input"
     might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for traditional
     practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of debugging tools, your suggestions
     for improvement of GDB are welcome in any case.

31.2 How to Report Bugs
=======================

A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained GDB from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file 'etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you submit bug reports for GDB.
The preferred method is to submit them directly using GDB's Bugs web
page (http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/).  Alternatively, the e-mail
gateway <bug-gdb@gnu.org> can be used.

   *Do not send bug reports to 'info-gdb', or to 'help-gdb', or to any
newsgroups.*  Most users of GDB do not want to receive bug reports.
Those that do have arranged to receive 'bug-gdb'.

   The mailing list 'bug-gdb' has a newsgroup 'gnu.gdb.bug' which serves
as a repeater.  The mailing list and the newsgroup carry exactly the
same messages.  Often people think of posting bug reports to the
newsgroup instead of mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one
problem which can be crucial: a newsgroup posting often lacks a mail
path back to the sender.  Thus, if we need to ask for more information,
we may be unable to reach you.  For this reason, it is better to send
bug reports to the mailing list.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this: *report
all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it
out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not
matter.  Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps
the bug is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the
location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the debugger into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug.  It may be that the bug has been reported previously, but
neither you nor we can know that unless your bug report is complete and
self-contained.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to _refuse
to respond to them_ except to chide the sender to report bugs properly.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of GDB.  GDB announces it if you start with no
     arguments; you can also print it at any time using 'show version'.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of GDB.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * The details of the GDB build-time configuration.  GDB shows these
     details if you invoke it with the '--configuration' command-line
     option, or if you type 'show configuration' at GDB's prompt.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile GDB--e.g.
     "gcc-2.8.1".

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile the program you
     are debugging--e.g. "gcc-2.8.1", or "HP92453-01 A.10.32.03 HP C
     Compiler".  For GCC, you can say 'gcc --version' to get this
     information; for other compilers, see the documentation for those
     compilers.

   * The command arguments you gave the compiler to compile your example
     and observe the bug.  For example, did you use '-O'?  To guarantee
     you will not omit something important, list them all.  A copy of
     the Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input script, and all necessary source files, that will
     reproduce the bug.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that GDB gets a fatal signal, then we will
     certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
     not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not
     give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of GDB is out of synch, or you have encountered
     a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your
     copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a
     crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug
     was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to expect a
     crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
     observations.

     To collect all this information, you can use a session recording
     program such as 'script', which is available on many Unix systems.
     Just run your GDB session inside 'script' and then include the
     'typescript' file with your bug report.

     Another way to record a GDB session is to run GDB inside Emacs and
     then save the entire buffer to a file.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the GDB source, send us context
     diffs.  If you even discuss something in the GDB source, refer to
     it by context, not by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in
     your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information
     to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_ of
     the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with
     your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we might
     not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as GDB it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that
     the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

32.1 Introduction to Line Editing
=================================

The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent
keystrokes.

   The text 'C-k' is read as 'Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the <k> key is pressed while the Control key is depressed.

   The text 'M-k' is read as 'Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <k>
key is pressed.  The Meta key is labeled <ALT> on many keyboards.  On
keyboards with two keys labeled <ALT> (usually to either side of the
space bar), the <ALT> on the left side is generally set to work as a
Meta key.  The <ALT> key on the right may also be configured to work as
a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a
Compose key for typing accented characters.

   If you do not have a Meta or <ALT> key, or another key working as a
Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <ESC>
_first_, and then typing <k>.  Either process is known as "metafying"
the <k> key.

   The text 'M-C-k' is read as 'Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by "metafying" 'C-k'.

   In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically, <DEL>,
<ESC>, <LFD>, <SPC>, <RET>, and <TAB> all stand for themselves when seen
in this text, or in an init file (*note Readline Init File::).  If your
keyboard lacks a <LFD> key, typing <C-j> will produce the desired
character.  The <RET> key may be labeled <Return> or <Enter> on some
keyboards.

32.2 Readline Interaction
=========================

Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <RET>.  You do not have to be at the end of
the line to press <RET>; the entire line is accepted regardless of the
location of the cursor within the line.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline Bare Essentials,  Next: Readline Movement Commands,  Up: Readline Interaction

32.2.1 Readline Bare Essentials
-------------------------------

In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The typed
character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves one
space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use your erase
character to back up and delete the mistyped character.

   Sometimes you may mistype a character, and not notice the error until
you have typed several other characters.  In that case, you can type
'C-b' to move the cursor to the left, and then correct your mistake.
Afterwards, you can move the cursor to the right with 'C-f'.

   When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that
characters to the right of the cursor are 'pushed over' to make room for
the text that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text behind
the cursor, characters to the right of the cursor are 'pulled back' to
fill in the blank space created by the removal of the text.  A list of
the bare essentials for editing the text of an input line follows.

'C-b'
     Move back one character.
'C-f'
     Move forward one character.
<DEL> or <Backspace>
     Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
'C-d'
     Delete the character underneath the cursor.
Printing characters
     Insert the character into the line at the cursor.
'C-_' or 'C-x C-u'
     Undo the last editing command.  You can undo all the way back to an
     empty line.

(Depending on your configuration, the <Backspace> key be set to delete
the character to the left of the cursor and the <DEL> key set to delete
the character underneath the cursor, like 'C-d', rather than the
character to the left of the cursor.)


File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline Movement Commands,  Next: Readline Killing Commands,  Prev: Readline Bare Essentials,  Up: Readline Interaction

32.2.2 Readline Movement Commands
---------------------------------

The above table describes the most basic keystrokes that you need in
order to do editing of the input line.  For your convenience, many other
commands have been added in addition to 'C-b', 'C-f', 'C-d', and <DEL>.
Here are some commands for moving more rapidly about the line.

'C-a'
     Move to the start of the line.
'C-e'
     Move to the end of the line.
'M-f'
     Move forward a word, where a word is composed of letters and
     digits.
'M-b'
     Move backward a word.
'C-l'
     Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.

   Notice how 'C-f' moves forward a character, while 'M-f' moves forward
a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes operate on
characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline Killing Commands,  Next: Readline Arguments,  Prev: Readline Movement Commands,  Up: Readline Interaction

32.2.3 Readline Killing Commands
--------------------------------

"Killing" text means to delete the text from the line, but to save it
away for later use, usually by "yanking" (re-inserting) it back into the
line.  ('Cut' and 'paste' are more recent jargon for 'kill' and 'yank'.)

   If the description for a command says that it 'kills' text, then you
can be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

   When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a "kill-ring".  Any
number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it all.  The kill ring is not line
specific; the text that you killed on a previously typed line is
available to be yanked back later, when you are typing another line.

   Here is the list of commands for killing text.

'C-k'
     Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the
     line.

'M-d'
     Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or, if between
     words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same
     as those used by 'M-f'.

'M-<DEL>'
     Kill from the cursor the start of the current word, or, if between
     words, to the start of the previous word.  Word boundaries are the
     same as those used by 'M-b'.

'C-w'
     Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is different
     than 'M-<DEL>' because the word boundaries differ.

   Here is how to "yank" the text back into the line.  Yanking means to
copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

'C-y'
     Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the
     cursor.

'M-y'
     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this
     if the prior command is 'C-y' or 'M-y'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline Arguments,  Next: Searching,  Prev: Readline Killing Commands,  Up: Readline Interaction

32.2.4 Readline Arguments
-------------------------

You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the sign of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type 'M-- C-k'.

   The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type
meta digits before the command.  If the first 'digit' typed is a minus
sign ('-'), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once you
have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type the
remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give the
'C-d' command an argument of 10, you could type 'M-1 0 C-d', which will
delete the next ten characters on the input line.

32.2.5 Searching for Commands in the History
--------------------------------------------

Readline provides commands for searching through the command history for
lines containing a specified string.  There are two search modes:
"incremental" and "non-incremental".

   Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
search string.  As each character of the search string is typed,
Readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string
typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters as
needed to find the desired history entry.  To search backward in the
history for a particular string, type 'C-r'.  Typing 'C-s' searches
forward through the history.  The characters present in the value of the
'isearch-terminators' variable are used to terminate an incremental
search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value, the <ESC> and
'C-J' characters will terminate an incremental search.  'C-g' will abort
an incremental search and restore the original line.  When the search is
terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the
current line.

   To find other matching entries in the history list, type 'C-r' or
'C-s' as appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in the
history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far.  Any
other key sequence bound to a Readline command will terminate the search
and execute that command.  For instance, a <RET> will terminate the
search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the
history list.  A movement command will terminate the search, make the
last line found the current line, and begin editing.

   Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two 'C-r's
are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search
string, any remembered search string is used.

   Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before
starting to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be
typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

32.3 Readline Init File
=======================

Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like keybindings
installed by default, it is possible to use a different set of
keybindings.  Any user can customize programs that use Readline by
putting commands in an "inputrc" file, conventionally in his home
directory.  The name of this file is taken from the value of the
environment variable 'INPUTRC'.  If that variable is unset, the default
is '~/.inputrc'.  If that file does not exist or cannot be read, the
ultimate default is '/etc/inputrc'.

   When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the init
file is read, and the key bindings are set.

   In addition, the 'C-x C-r' command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline Init File Syntax,  Next: Conditional Init Constructs,  Up: Readline Init File

32.3.1 Readline Init File Syntax
--------------------------------

There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the Readline init file.
Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a '#' are comments.
Lines beginning with a '$' indicate conditional constructs (*note
Conditional Init Constructs::).  Other lines denote variable settings
and key bindings.

Variable Settings
     You can modify the run-time behavior of Readline by altering the
     values of variables in Readline using the 'set' command within the
     init file.  The syntax is simple:

          set VARIABLE VALUE

     Here, for example, is how to change from the default Emacs-like key
     binding to use 'vi' line editing commands:

          set editing-mode vi

     Variable names and values, where appropriate, are recognized
     without regard to case.  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.

     Boolean variables (those that can be set to on or off) are set to
     on if the value is null or empty, ON (case-insensitive), or 1.  Any
     other value results in the variable being set to off.

     A great deal of run-time behavior is changeable with the following
     variables.

     'bell-style'
          Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal
          bell.  If set to 'none', Readline never rings the bell.  If
          set to 'visible', Readline uses a visible bell if one is
          available.  If set to 'audible' (the default), Readline
          attempts to ring the terminal's bell.

     'bind-tty-special-chars'
          If set to 'on', Readline attempts to bind the control
          characters treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver
          to their Readline equivalents.

     'comment-begin'
          The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the
          'insert-comment' command is executed.  The default value is
          '"#"'.

     'completion-display-width'
          The number of screen columns used to display possible matches
          when performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is
          less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A
          value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line.
          The default value is -1.

     'completion-ignore-case'
          If set to 'on', Readline performs filename matching and
          completion in a case-insensitive fashion.  The default value
          is 'off'.

     'completion-map-case'
          If set to 'on', and COMPLETION-IGNORE-CASE is enabled,
          Readline treats hyphens ('-') and underscores ('_') as
          equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching
          and completion.

     'completion-prefix-display-length'
          The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of
          possible completions that is displayed without modification.
          When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer
          than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying
          possible completions.

     'completion-query-items'
          The number of possible completions that determines when the
          user is asked whether the list of possibilities should be
          displayed.  If the number of possible completions is greater
          than this value, Readline will ask the user whether or not he
          wishes to view them; otherwise, they are simply listed.  This
          variable must be set to an integer value greater than or equal
          to 0.  A negative value means Readline should never ask.  The
          default limit is '100'.

     'convert-meta'
          If set to 'on', Readline will convert characters with the
          eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the
          eighth bit and prefixing an <ESC> character, converting them
          to a meta-prefixed key sequence.  The default value is 'on'.

     'disable-completion'
          If set to 'On', Readline will inhibit word completion.
          Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if
          they had been mapped to 'self-insert'.  The default is 'off'.

     'editing-mode'
          The 'editing-mode' variable controls which default set of key
          bindings is used.  By default, Readline starts up in Emacs
          editing mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.
          This variable can be set to either 'emacs' or 'vi'.

     'echo-control-characters'
          When set to 'on', on operating systems that indicate they
          support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a
          signal generated from the keyboard.  The default is 'on'.

     'enable-keypad'
          When set to 'on', Readline will try to enable the application
          keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable
          the arrow keys.  The default is 'off'.

     'enable-meta-key'
          When set to 'on', Readline will try to enable any meta
          modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called.
          On many terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit
          characters.  The default is 'on'.

     'expand-tilde'
          If set to 'on', tilde expansion is performed when Readline
          attempts word completion.  The default is 'off'.

     'history-preserve-point'
          If set to 'on', the history code attempts to place the point
          (the current cursor position) at the same location on each
          history line retrieved with 'previous-history' or
          'next-history'.  The default is 'off'.

     'history-size'
          Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history
          list.  If set to zero, the number of entries in the history
          list is not limited.

     'horizontal-scroll-mode'
          This variable can be set to either 'on' or 'off'.  Setting it
          to 'on' means that the text of the lines being edited will
          scroll horizontally on a single screen line when they are
          longer than the width of the screen, instead of wrapping onto
          a new screen line.  By default, this variable is set to 'off'.

     'input-meta'
          If set to 'on', Readline will enable eight-bit input (it will
          not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads),
          regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The
          default value is 'off'.  The name 'meta-flag' is a synonym for
          this variable.

     'isearch-terminators'
          The string of characters that should terminate an incremental
          search without subsequently executing the character as a
          command (*note Searching::).  If this variable has not been
          given a value, the characters <ESC> and 'C-J' will terminate
          an incremental search.

     'keymap'
          Sets Readline's idea of the current keymap for key binding
          commands.  Acceptable 'keymap' names are 'emacs',
          'emacs-standard', 'emacs-meta', 'emacs-ctlx', 'vi', 'vi-move',
          'vi-command', and 'vi-insert'.  'vi' is equivalent to
          'vi-command'; 'emacs' is equivalent to 'emacs-standard'.  The
          default value is 'emacs'.  The value of the 'editing-mode'
          variable also affects the default keymap.

     'mark-directories'
          If set to 'on', completed directory names have a slash
          appended.  The default is 'on'.

     'mark-modified-lines'
          This variable, when set to 'on', causes Readline to display an
          asterisk ('*') at the start of history lines which have been
          modified.  This variable is 'off' by default.

     'mark-symlinked-directories'
          If set to 'on', completed names which are symbolic links to
          directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of
          'mark-directories').  The default is 'off'.

     'match-hidden-files'
          This variable, when set to 'on', causes Readline to match
          files whose names begin with a '.' (hidden files) when
          performing filename completion.  If set to 'off', the leading
          '.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to be
          completed.  This variable is 'on' by default.

     'menu-complete-display-prefix'
          If set to 'on', menu completion displays the common prefix of
          the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before
          cycling through the list.  The default is 'off'.

     'output-meta'
          If set to 'on', Readline will display characters with the
          eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
          sequence.  The default is 'off'.

     'page-completions'
          If set to 'on', Readline uses an internal 'more'-like pager to
          display a screenful of possible completions at a time.  This
          variable is 'on' by default.

     'print-completions-horizontally'
          If set to 'on', Readline will display completions with matches
          sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down
          the screen.  The default is 'off'.

     'revert-all-at-newline'
          If set to 'on', Readline will undo all changes to history
          lines before returning when 'accept-line' is executed.  By
          default, history lines may be modified and retain individual
          undo lists across calls to 'readline'.  The default is 'off'.

     'show-all-if-ambiguous'
          This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.
          If set to 'on', words which have more than one possible
          completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead
          of ringing the bell.  The default value is 'off'.

     'show-all-if-unmodified'
          This alters the default behavior of the completion functions
          in a fashion similar to SHOW-ALL-IF-AMBIGUOUS.  If set to
          'on', words which have more than one possible completion
          without any possible partial completion (the possible
          completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to
          be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.  The
          default value is 'off'.

     'skip-completed-text'
          If set to 'on', this alters the default completion behavior
          when inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active
          when performing completion in the middle of a word.  If
          enabled, readline does not insert characters from the
          completion that match characters after point in the word being
          completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are
          not duplicated.  For instance, if this is enabled, attempting
          completion when the cursor is after the 'e' in 'Makefile' will
          result in 'Makefile' rather than 'Makefilefile', assuming
          there is a single possible completion.  The default value is
          'off'.

     'visible-stats'
          If set to 'on', a character denoting a file's type is appended
          to the filename when listing possible completions.  The
          default is 'off'.

Key Bindings
     The syntax for controlling key bindings in the init file is simple.
     First you need to find the name of the command that you want to
     change.  The following sections contain tables of the command name,
     the default keybinding, if any, and a short description of what the
     command does.

     Once you know the name of the command, simply place on a line in
     the init file the name of the key you wish to bind the command to,
     a colon, and then the name of the command.  There can be no space
     between the key name and the colon - that will be interpreted as
     part of the key name.  The name of the key can be expressed in
     different ways, depending on what you find most comfortable.

     In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a
     string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a MACRO).

     KEYNAME: FUNCTION-NAME or MACRO
          KEYNAME is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For
          example:
               Control-u: universal-argument
               Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
               Control-o: "> output"

          In the above example, 'C-u' is bound to the function
          'universal-argument', 'M-DEL' is bound to the function
          'backward-kill-word', and 'C-o' is bound to run the macro
          expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
          '> output' into the line).

          A number of symbolic character names are recognized while
          processing this key binding syntax: DEL, ESC, ESCAPE, LFD,
          NEWLINE, RET, RETURN, RUBOUT, SPACE, SPC, and TAB.

     "KEYSEQ": FUNCTION-NAME or MACRO
          KEYSEQ differs from KEYNAME above in that strings denoting an
          entire key sequence can be specified, by placing the key
          sequence in double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes
          can be used, as in the following example, but the special
          character names are not recognized.

               "\C-u": universal-argument
               "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
               "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

          In the above example, 'C-u' is again bound to the function
          'universal-argument' (just as it was in the first example),
          ''C-x' 'C-r'' is bound to the function 're-read-init-file',
          and '<ESC> <[> <1> <1> <~>' is bound to insert the text
          'Function Key 1'.

     The following GNU Emacs style escape sequences are available when
     specifying key sequences:

     '\C-'
          control prefix
     '\M-'
          meta prefix
     '\e'
          an escape character
     '\\'
          backslash
     '\"'
          <">, a double quotation mark
     '\''
          <'>, a single quote or apostrophe

     In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set
     of backslash escapes is available:

     '\a'
          alert (bell)
     '\b'
          backspace
     '\d'
          delete
     '\f'
          form feed
     '\n'
          newline
     '\r'
          carriage return
     '\t'
          horizontal tab
     '\v'
          vertical tab
     '\NNN'
          the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value NNN
          (one to three digits)
     '\xHH'
          the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value
          HH (one or two hex digits)

     When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be
     used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to
     be a function name.  In the macro body, the backslash escapes
     described above are expanded.  Backslash will quote any other
     character in the macro text, including '"' and '''.  For example,
     the following binding will make ''C-x' \' insert a single '\' into
     the line:
          "\C-x\\": "\\"

32.3.2 Conditional Init Constructs
----------------------------------

Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and
variable settings to be performed as the result of tests.  There are
four parser directives used.

'$if'
     The '$if' construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing
     mode, the terminal being used, or the application using Readline.
     The text of the test extends to the end of the line; no characters
     are required to isolate it.

     'mode'
          The 'mode=' form of the '$if' directive is used to test
          whether Readline is in 'emacs' or 'vi' mode.  This may be used
          in conjunction with the 'set keymap' command, for instance, to
          set bindings in the 'emacs-standard' and 'emacs-ctlx' keymaps
          only if Readline is starting out in 'emacs' mode.

     'term'
          The 'term=' form may be used to include terminal-specific key
          bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
          terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the
          '=' is tested against both the full name of the terminal and
          the portion of the terminal name before the first '-'.  This
          allows 'sun' to match both 'sun' and 'sun-cmd', for instance.

     'application'
          The APPLICATION construct is used to include
          application-specific settings.  Each program using the
          Readline library sets the APPLICATION NAME, and you can test
          for a particular value.  This could be used to bind key
          sequences to functions useful for a specific program.  For
          instance, the following command adds a key sequence that
          quotes the current or previous word in Bash:
               $if Bash
               # Quote the current or previous word
               "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
               $endif

'$endif'
     This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an '$if'
     command.

'$else'
     Commands in this branch of the '$if' directive are executed if the
     test fails.

'$include'
     This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads
     commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the following
     directive reads from '/etc/inputrc':
          $include /etc/inputrc

     Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are
     composed of letters and digits.

'clear-screen (C-l)'
     Clear the screen and redraw the current line, leaving the current
     line at the top of the screen.

'redraw-current-line ()'
     Refresh the current line.  By default, this is unbound.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For History,  Next: Commands For Text,  Prev: Commands For Moving,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.2 Commands For Manipulating The History
--------------------------------------------

'accept-line (Newline or Return)'
     Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is
     non-empty, it may be added to the history list for future recall
     with 'add_history()'.  If this line is a modified history line, the
     history line is restored to its original state.

'previous-history (C-p)'
     Move 'back' through the history list, fetching the previous
     command.

'next-history (C-n)'
     Move 'forward' through the history list, fetching the next command.

'beginning-of-history (M-<)'
     Move to the first line in the history.

'end-of-history (M->)'
     Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently
     being entered.

'reverse-search-history (C-r)'
     Search backward starting at the current line and moving 'up'
     through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.

'forward-search-history (C-s)'
     Search forward starting at the current line and moving 'down'
     through the the history as necessary.  This is an incremental
     search.

'non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)'
     Search backward starting at the current line and moving 'up'
     through the history as necessary using a non-incremental search for
     a string supplied by the user.

'non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)'
     Search forward starting at the current line and moving 'down'
     through the the history as necessary using a non-incremental search
     for a string supplied by the user.

'history-search-forward ()'
     Search forward through the history for the string of characters
     between the start of the current line and the point.  This is a
     non-incremental search.  By default, this command is unbound.

'history-search-backward ()'
     Search backward through the history for the string of characters
     between the start of the current line and the point.  This is a
     non-incremental search.  By default, this command is unbound.

'yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)'
     Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the
     second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument N,
     insert the Nth word from the previous command (the words in the
     previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts
     the Nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once the
     argument N is computed, the argument is extracted as if the '!N'
     history expansion had been specified.

'yank-last-arg (M-. or M-_)'
     Insert last argument to the previous command (the last word of the
     previous history entry).  With a numeric argument, behave exactly
     like 'yank-nth-arg'.  Successive calls to 'yank-last-arg' move back
     through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word
     specified by the argument to the first call) of each line in turn.
     Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls determines
     the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument
     switches the direction through the history (back or forward).  The
     history expansion facilities are used to extract the last argument,
     as if the '!$' history expansion had been specified.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Text,  Next: Commands For Killing,  Prev: Commands For History,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.3 Commands For Changing Text
---------------------------------

'delete-char (C-d)'
     Delete the character at point.  If point is at the beginning of the
     line, there are no characters in the line, and the last character
     typed was not bound to 'delete-char', then return EOF.

'backward-delete-char (Rubout)'
     Delete the character behind the cursor.  A numeric argument means
     to kill the characters instead of deleting them.

'forward-backward-delete-char ()'
     Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the
     end of the line, in which case the character behind the cursor is
     deleted.  By default, this is not bound to a key.

'quoted-insert (C-q or C-v)'
     Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how to
     insert key sequences like 'C-q', for example.

'tab-insert (M-<TAB>)'
     Insert a tab character.

'self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)'
     Insert yourself.

'transpose-chars (C-t)'
     Drag the character before the cursor forward over the character at
     the cursor, moving the cursor forward as well.  If the insertion
     point is at the end of the line, then this transposes the last two
     characters of the line.  Negative arguments have no effect.

'transpose-words (M-t)'
     Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point
     past that word as well.  If the insertion point is at the end of
     the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.

'upcase-word (M-u)'
     Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative
     argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

'downcase-word (M-l)'
     Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative
     argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

'capitalize-word (M-c)'
     Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative
     argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move the cursor.

'overwrite-mode ()'
     Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument,
     switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric
     argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects only
     'emacs' mode; 'vi' mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to
     'readline()' starts in insert mode.

     In overwrite mode, characters bound to 'self-insert' replace the
     text at point rather than pushing the text to the right.
     Characters bound to 'backward-delete-char' replace the character
     before point with a space.

     By default, this command is unbound.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Killing,  Next: Numeric Arguments,  Prev: Commands For Text,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.4 Killing And Yanking
--------------------------

'kill-line (C-k)'
     Kill the text from point to the end of the line.

'backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)'
     Kill backward to the beginning of the line.

'unix-line-discard (C-u)'
     Kill backward from the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

'kill-whole-line ()'
     Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.
     By default, this is unbound.

'kill-word (M-d)'
     Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between
     words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same
     as 'forward-word'.

'backward-kill-word (M-<DEL>)'
     Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as
     'backward-word'.

'unix-word-rubout (C-w)'
     Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary.
     The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.

'unix-filename-rubout ()'
     Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash
     character as the word boundaries.  The killed text is saved on the
     kill-ring.

'delete-horizontal-space ()'
     Delete all spaces and tabs around point.  By default, this is
     unbound.

'kill-region ()'
     Kill the text in the current region.  By default, this command is
     unbound.

'copy-region-as-kill ()'
     Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked
     right away.  By default, this command is unbound.

'copy-backward-word ()'
     Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries
     are the same as 'backward-word'.  By default, this command is
     unbound.

'copy-forward-word ()'
     Copy the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word
     boundaries are the same as 'forward-word'.  By default, this
     command is unbound.

'yank (C-y)'
     Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.

'yank-pop (M-y)'
     Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this
     if the prior command is 'yank' or 'yank-pop'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Numeric Arguments,  Next: Commands For Completion,  Prev: Commands For Killing,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.5 Specifying Numeric Arguments
-----------------------------------

'digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ... M--)'
     Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new
     argument.  'M--' starts a negative argument.

'universal-argument ()'
     This is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is
     followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading minus
     sign, those digits define the argument.  If the command is followed
     by digits, executing 'universal-argument' again ends the numeric
     argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this
     command is immediately followed by a character that is neither a
     digit or minus sign, the argument count for the next command is
     multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially one, so
     executing this function the first time makes the argument count
     four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.
     By default, this is not bound to a key.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Commands For Completion,  Next: Keyboard Macros,  Prev: Numeric Arguments,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.6 Letting Readline Type For You
------------------------------------

'complete (<TAB>)'
     Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  The actual
     completion performed is application-specific.  The default is
     filename completion.

'possible-completions (M-?)'
     List the possible completions of the text before point.  When
     displaying completions, Readline sets the number of columns used
     for display to the value of 'completion-display-width', the value
     of the environment variable 'COLUMNS', or the screen width, in that
     order.

'insert-completions (M-*)'
     Insert all completions of the text before point that would have
     been generated by 'possible-completions'.

'menu-complete ()'
     Similar to 'complete', but replaces the word to be completed with a
     single match from the list of possible completions.  Repeated
     execution of 'menu-complete' steps through the list of possible
     completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the end of the list
     of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of
     'bell-style') and the original text is restored.  An argument of N
     moves N positions forward in the list of matches; a negative
     argument may be used to move backward through the list.  This
     command is intended to be bound to <TAB>, but is unbound by
     default.

'menu-complete-backward ()'
     Identical to 'menu-complete', but moves backward through the list
     of possible completions, as if 'menu-complete' had been given a
     negative argument.

'delete-char-or-list ()'
     Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or
     end of the line (like 'delete-char').  If at the end of the line,
     behaves identically to 'possible-completions'.  This command is
     unbound by default.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Keyboard Macros,  Next: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Commands For Completion,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.7 Keyboard Macros
----------------------

'start-kbd-macro (C-x ()'
     Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro.

'end-kbd-macro (C-x ))'
     Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro
     and save the definition.

'call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e)'
     Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making the
     characters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Keyboard Macros,  Up: Bindable Readline Commands

32.4.8 Some Miscellaneous Commands
----------------------------------

're-read-init-file (C-x C-r)'
     Read in the contents of the INPUTRC file, and incorporate any
     bindings or variable assignments found there.

'abort (C-g)'
     Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal's bell
     (subject to the setting of 'bell-style').

'do-uppercase-version (M-a, M-b, M-X, ...)'
     If the metafied character X is lowercase, run the command that is
     bound to the corresponding uppercase character.

'prefix-meta (<ESC>)'
     Metafy the next character typed.  This is for keyboards without a
     meta key.  Typing '<ESC> f' is equivalent to typing 'M-f'.

'undo (C-_ or C-x C-u)'
     Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.

'revert-line (M-r)'
     Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like executing the
     'undo' command enough times to get back to the beginning.

'tilde-expand (M-~)'
     Perform tilde expansion on the current word.

'set-mark (C-@)'
     Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the
     mark is set to that position.

'exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)'
     Swap the point with the mark.  The current cursor position is set
     to the saved position, and the old cursor position is saved as the
     mark.

'character-search (C-])'
     A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of
     that character.  A negative count searches for previous
     occurrences.

'character-search-backward (M-C-])'
     A character is read and point is moved to the previous occurrence
     of that character.  A negative count searches for subsequent
     occurrences.

'skip-csi-sequence ()'
     Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as
     those defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences begin
     with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[.  If this
     sequence is bound to "\e[", keys producing such sequences will have
     no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of
     inserting stray characters into the editing buffer.  This is
     unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[.

'insert-comment (M-#)'
     Without a numeric argument, the value of the 'comment-begin'
     variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line.  If a
     numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle: if the
     characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of
     'comment-begin', the value is inserted, otherwise the characters in
     'comment-begin' are deleted from the beginning of the line.  In
     either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.

'dump-functions ()'
     Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the Readline
     output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is
     formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an INPUTRC
     file.  This command is unbound by default.

'dump-variables ()'
     Print all of the settable variables and their values to the
     Readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the
     output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an
     INPUTRC file.  This command is unbound by default.

'dump-macros ()'
     Print all of the Readline key sequences bound to macros and the
     strings they output.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output
     is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an INPUTRC
     file.  This command is unbound by default.

'emacs-editing-mode (C-e)'
     When in 'vi' command mode, this causes a switch to 'emacs' editing
     mode.

'vi-editing-mode (M-C-j)'
     When in 'emacs' editing mode, this causes a switch to 'vi' editing
     mode.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Readline vi Mode,  Prev: Bindable Readline Commands,  Up: Command Line Editing

32.5 Readline vi Mode
=====================

While the Readline library does not have a full set of 'vi' editing
functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing of the line.
The Readline 'vi' mode behaves as specified in the POSIX standard.

   In order to switch interactively between 'emacs' and 'vi' editing
modes, use the command 'M-C-j' (bound to emacs-editing-mode when in 'vi'
mode and to vi-editing-mode in 'emacs' mode).  The Readline default is
'emacs' mode.

   When you enter a line in 'vi' mode, you are already placed in
'insertion' mode, as if you had typed an 'i'.  Pressing <ESC> switches
you into 'command' mode, where you can edit the text of the line with
the standard 'vi' movement keys, move to previous history lines with 'k'
and subsequent lines with 'j', and so forth.

33 Using History Interactively
******************************

This chapter describes how to use the GNU History Library interactively,
from a user's standpoint.  It should be considered a user's guide.  For
information on using the GNU History Library in your own programs, *note
(history)Programming with GNU History::.

* Menu:

* History Interaction::		What it feels like using History as a user.


File: gdb.info,  Node: History Interaction,  Up: Using History Interactively

33.1 History Expansion
======================

The History library provides a history expansion feature that is similar
to the history expansion provided by 'csh'.  This section describes the
syntax used to manipulate the history information.

   History expansions introduce words from the history list into the
input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to
a previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in
previous commands quickly.

   History expansion takes place in two parts.  The first is to
determine which line from the history list should be used during
substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line for
inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the history is
called the "event", and the portions of that line that are acted upon
are called "words".  Various "modifiers" are available to manipulate the
selected words.  The line is broken into words in the same fashion that
Bash does, so that several words surrounded by quotes are considered one
word.  History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the
history expansion character, which is '!' by default.

* Modifiers::		Modifying the results of substitution.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Event Designators,  Next: Word Designators,  Up: History Interaction

33.1.1 Event Designators
------------------------

An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the
history list.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to
the current position in the history list.

'!'
     Start a history substitution, except when followed by a space, tab,
     the end of the line, or '='.

'!N'
     Refer to command line N.

'!-N'
     Refer to the command N lines back.

'!!'
     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for '!-1'.

'!STRING'
     Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in
     the history list starting with STRING.

'!?STRING[?]'
     Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in
     the history list containing STRING.  The trailing '?' may be
     omitted if the STRING is followed immediately by a newline.

'^STRING1^STRING2^'
     Quick Substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing STRING1
     with STRING2.  Equivalent to '!!:s/STRING1/STRING2/'.

'!#'
     The entire command line typed so far.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Word Designators,  Next: Modifiers,  Prev: Event Designators,  Up: History Interaction

33.1.2 Word Designators
-----------------------

Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  A ':'
separates the event specification from the word designator.  It may be
omitted if the word designator begins with a '^', '$', '*', '-', or '%'.
Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word
being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line
separated by single spaces.

   For example,

'!!'
     designates the preceding command.  When you type this, the
     preceding command is repeated in toto.

'!!:$'
     designates the last argument of the preceding command.  This may be
     shortened to '!$'.

'!fi:2'
     designates the second argument of the most recent command starting
     with the letters 'fi'.

   Here are the word designators:

'0 (zero)'
     The '0'th word.  For many applications, this is the command word.

'N'
     The Nth word.

'^'
     The first argument; that is, word 1.

'$'
     The last argument.

'%'
     The word matched by the most recent '?STRING?' search.

'X-Y'
     A range of words; '-Y' abbreviates '0-Y'.

'*'
     All of the words, except the '0'th.  This is a synonym for '1-$'.
     It is not an error to use '*' if there is just one word in the
     event; the empty string is returned in that case.

'X*'
     Abbreviates 'X-$'

'X-'
     Abbreviates 'X-$' like 'X*', but omits the last word.

   If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the
previous command is used as the event.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Modifiers,  Prev: Word Designators,  Up: History Interaction

33.1.3 Modifiers
----------------

After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or
more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a ':'.

'h'
     Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.

't'
     Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.

'r'
     Remove a trailing suffix of the form '.SUFFIX', leaving the
     basename.

'e'
     Remove all but the trailing suffix.

'p'
     Print the new command but do not execute it.

's/OLD/NEW/'
     Substitute NEW for the first occurrence of OLD in the event line.
     Any delimiter may be used in place of '/'.  The delimiter may be
     quoted in OLD and NEW with a single backslash.  If '&' appears in
     NEW, it is replaced by OLD.  A single backslash will quote the '&'.

Appendix A In Memoriam
**********************

The GDB project mourns the loss of the following long-time contributors:

'Fred Fish'
     Fred was a long-standing contributor to GDB (1991-2006), and to
     Free Software in general.  Outside of GDB, he was known in the
     Amiga world for his series of Fish Disks, and the GeekGadget
     project.

'Michael Snyder'
     Michael was one of the Global Maintainers of the GDB project, with
     contributions recorded as early as 1996, until 2011.  In addition
     to his day to day participation, he was a large driving force
     behind adding Reverse Debugging to GDB.

   Beyond their technical contributions to the project, they were also
enjoyable members of the Free Software Community.  We will miss them.

Appendix B Formatting Documentation
***********************************

The GDB 4 release includes an already-formatted reference card, ready
for printing with PostScript or Ghostscript, in the 'gdb' subdirectory
of the main source directory(1).  If you can use PostScript or
Ghostscript with your printer, you can print the reference card
immediately with 'refcard.ps'.

   The release also includes the source for the reference card.  You can
format it, using TeX, by typing:

     make refcard.dvi

   The GDB reference card is designed to print in "landscape" mode on US
"letter" size paper; that is, on a sheet 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
high.  You will need to specify this form of printing as an option to
your DVI output program.

   All the documentation for GDB comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or 'texi2roff') to typeset the printed version.

   GDB includes an already formatted copy of the on-line Info version of
this manual in the 'gdb' subdirectory.  The main Info file is
'gdb-7.8.1/gdb/gdb.info', and it refers to subordinate files matching
'gdb.info*' in the same directory.  If necessary, you can print out
these files, or read them with any editor; but they are easier to read
using the 'info' subsystem in GNU Emacs or the standalone 'info'
program, available as part of the GNU Texinfo distribution.

   If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as 'texinfo-format-buffer' or 'makeinfo'.

   If you have 'makeinfo' installed, and are in the top level GDB source
directory ('gdb-7.8.1', in the case of version 7.8.1), you can make the
Info file by typing:

     cd gdb
     make gdb.info

   If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its DVI output files, and 'texinfo.tex', the Texinfo
definitions file.

   TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called DVI files.  To print a typeset document,
you need a program to print DVI files.  If your system has TeX
installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise command to
use depends on your system; 'lpr -d' is common; another (for PostScript
devices) is 'dvips'.  The DVI print command may require a file name
without any extension or a '.dvi' extension.

   TeX also requires a macro definitions file called 'texinfo.tex'.
This file tells TeX how to typeset a document written in Texinfo format.
On its own, TeX cannot either read or typeset a Texinfo file.
'texinfo.tex' is distributed with GDB and is located in the
'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER/texinfo' directory.

   If you have TeX and a DVI printer program installed, you can typeset
and print this manual.  First switch to the 'gdb' subdirectory of the
main source directory (for example, to 'gdb-7.8.1/gdb') and type:

     make gdb.dvi

   Then give 'gdb.dvi' to your DVI printing program.

C.1 Requirements for Building GDB
=================================

Building GDB requires various tools and packages to be available.  Other
packages will be used only if they are found.

Tools/Packages Necessary for Building GDB
=========================================

ISO C90 compiler
     GDB is written in ISO C90.  It should be buildable with any working
     C90 compiler, e.g. GCC.

Tools/Packages Optional for Building GDB
========================================

Expat
     GDB can use the Expat XML parsing library.  This library may be
     included with your operating system distribution; if it is not, you
     can get the latest version from <http://expat.sourceforge.net>.
     The 'configure' script will search for this library in several
     standard locations; if it is installed in an unusual path, you can
     use the '--with-libexpat-prefix' option to specify its location.

     Expat is used for:

        * Remote protocol memory maps (*note Memory Map Format::)
        * Target descriptions (*note Target Descriptions::)
        * Remote shared library lists (*Note Library List Format::, or
          alternatively *note Library List Format for SVR4 Targets::)
        * MS-Windows shared libraries (*note Shared Libraries::)
        * Traceframe info (*note Traceframe Info Format::)
        * Branch trace (*note Branch Trace Format::)

zlib
     GDB will use the 'zlib' library, if available, to read compressed
     debug sections.  Some linkers, such as GNU gold, are capable of
     producing binaries with compressed debug sections.  If GDB is
     compiled with 'zlib', it will be able to read the debug information
     in such binaries.

     The 'zlib' library is likely included with your operating system
     distribution; if it is not, you can get the latest version from
     <http://zlib.net>.

iconv
     GDB's features related to character sets (*note Character Sets::)
     require a functioning 'iconv' implementation.  If you are on a GNU
     system, then this is provided by the GNU C Library.  Some other
     systems also provide a working 'iconv'.

     If GDB is using the 'iconv' program which is installed in a
     non-standard place, you will need to tell GDB where to find it.
     This is done with '--with-iconv-bin' which specifies the directory
     that contains the 'iconv' program.

     On systems without 'iconv', you can install GNU Libiconv.  If you
     have previously installed Libiconv, you can use the
     '--with-libiconv-prefix' option to configure.

     GDB's top-level 'configure' and 'Makefile' will arrange to build
     Libiconv if a directory named 'libiconv' appears in the top-most
     source directory.  If Libiconv is built this way, and if the
     operating system does not provide a suitable 'iconv'
     implementation, then the just-built library will automatically be
     used by GDB.  One easy way to set this up is to download GNU
     Libiconv, unpack it, and then rename the directory holding the
     Libiconv source code to 'libiconv'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Running Configure,  Next: Separate Objdir,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Installing GDB

C.2 Invoking the GDB 'configure' Script
=======================================

GDB comes with a 'configure' script that automates the process of
preparing GDB for installation; you can then use 'make' to build the
'gdb' program.

   The GDB distribution includes all the source code you need for GDB in
a single directory, whose name is usually composed by appending the
version number to 'gdb'.

   For example, the GDB version 7.8.1 distribution is in the 'gdb-7.8.1'
directory.  That directory contains:

'gdb-7.8.1/configure (and supporting files)'
     script for configuring GDB and all its supporting libraries

'gdb-7.8.1/gdb'
     the source specific to GDB itself

'gdb-7.8.1/bfd'
     source for the Binary File Descriptor library

'gdb-7.8.1/include'
     GNU include files

'gdb-7.8.1/libiberty'
     source for the '-liberty' free software library

'gdb-7.8.1/opcodes'
     source for the library of opcode tables and disassemblers

'gdb-7.8.1/readline'
     source for the GNU command-line interface

'gdb-7.8.1/glob'
     source for the GNU filename pattern-matching subroutine

'gdb-7.8.1/mmalloc'
     source for the GNU memory-mapped malloc package

   The simplest way to configure and build GDB is to run 'configure'
from the 'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' source directory, which in this example is
the 'gdb-7.8.1' directory.

   First switch to the 'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' source directory if you are
not already in it; then run 'configure'.  Pass the identifier for the
platform on which GDB will run as an argument.

   For example:

     cd gdb-7.8.1
     ./configure HOST
     make

where HOST is an identifier such as 'sun4' or 'decstation', that
identifies the platform where GDB will run.  (You can often leave off
HOST; 'configure' tries to guess the correct value by examining your
system.)

   Running 'configure HOST' and then running 'make' builds the 'bfd',
'readline', 'mmalloc', and 'libiberty' libraries, then 'gdb' itself.
The configured source files, and the binaries, are left in the
corresponding source directories.

   'configure' is a Bourne-shell ('/bin/sh') script; if your system does
not recognize this automatically when you run a different shell, you may
need to run 'sh' on it explicitly:

     sh configure HOST

   If you run 'configure' from a directory that contains source
directories for multiple libraries or programs, such as the 'gdb-7.8.1'
source directory for version 7.8.1, 'configure' creates configuration
files for every directory level underneath (unless you tell it not to,
with the '--norecursion' option).

   You should run the 'configure' script from the top directory in the
source tree, the 'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' directory.  If you run 'configure'
from one of the subdirectories, you will configure only that
subdirectory.  That is usually not what you want.  In particular, if you
run the first 'configure' from the 'gdb' subdirectory of the
'gdb-VERSION-NUMBER' directory, you will omit the configuration of
'bfd', 'readline', and other sibling directories of the 'gdb'
subdirectory.  This leads to build errors about missing include files
such as 'bfd/bfd.h'.

   You can install 'gdb' anywhere; it has no hardwired paths.  However,
you should make sure that the shell on your path (named by the 'SHELL'
environment variable) is publicly readable.  Remember that GDB uses the
shell to start your program--some systems refuse to let GDB debug child
processes whose programs are not readable.

C.3 Compiling GDB in Another Directory
======================================

If you want to run GDB versions for several host or target machines, you
need a different 'gdb' compiled for each combination of host and target.
'configure' is designed to make this easy by allowing you to generate
each configuration in a separate subdirectory, rather than in the source
directory.  If your 'make' program handles the 'VPATH' feature (GNU
'make' does), running 'make' in each of these directories builds the
'gdb' program specified there.

   To build 'gdb' in a separate directory, run 'configure' with the
'--srcdir' option to specify where to find the source.  (You also need
to specify a path to find 'configure' itself from your working
directory.  If the path to 'configure' would be the same as the argument
to '--srcdir', you can leave out the '--srcdir' option; it is assumed.)

   For example, with version 7.8.1, you can build GDB in a separate
directory for a Sun 4 like this:

     cd gdb-7.8.1
     mkdir ../gdb-sun4
     cd ../gdb-sun4
     ../gdb-7.8.1/configure sun4
     make

   When 'configure' builds a configuration using a remote source
directory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure
(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In
the example, you'd find the Sun 4 library 'libiberty.a' in the directory
'gdb-sun4/libiberty', and GDB itself in 'gdb-sun4/gdb'.

   Make sure that your path to the 'configure' script has just one
instance of 'gdb' in it.  If your path to 'configure' looks like
'../gdb-7.8.1/gdb/configure', you are configuring only one subdirectory
of GDB, not the whole package.  This leads to build errors about missing
include files such as 'bfd/bfd.h'.

   One popular reason to build several GDB configurations in separate
directories is to configure GDB for cross-compiling (where GDB runs on
one machine--the "host"--while debugging programs that run on another
machine--the "target").  You specify a cross-debugging target by giving
the '--target=TARGET' option to 'configure'.

   When you run 'make' to build a program or library, you must run it in
a configured directory--whatever directory you were in when you called
'configure' (or one of its subdirectories).

   The 'Makefile' that 'configure' generates in each source directory
also runs recursively.  If you type 'make' in a source directory such as
'gdb-7.8.1' (or in a separate configured directory configured with
'--srcdir=DIRNAME/gdb-7.8.1'), you will build all the required
libraries, and then build GDB.

   When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate
directories, you can run 'make' on them in parallel (for example, if
they are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere with
each other.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Config Names,  Next: Configure Options,  Prev: Separate Objdir,  Up: Installing GDB

C.4 Specifying Names for Hosts and Targets
==========================================

The specifications used for hosts and targets in the 'configure' script
are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short predefined
aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes three pieces
of information in the following pattern:

     ARCHITECTURE-VENDOR-OS

   For example, you can use the alias 'sun4' as a HOST argument, or as
the value for TARGET in a '--target=TARGET' option.  The equivalent full
name is 'sparc-sun-sunos4'.

   The 'configure' script accompanying GDB does not provide any query
facility to list all supported host and target names or aliases.
'configure' calls the Bourne shell script 'config.sub' to map
abbreviations to full names; you can read the script, if you wish, or
you can use it to test your guesses on abbreviations--for example:

     % sh config.sub i386-linux
     i386-pc-linux-gnu
     % sh config.sub alpha-linux
     alpha-unknown-linux-gnu
     % sh config.sub hp9k700
     hppa1.1-hp-hpux
     % sh config.sub sun4
     sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub sun3
     m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
     % sh config.sub i986v
     Invalid configuration `i986v': machine `i986v' not recognized

'config.sub' is also distributed in the GDB source directory
('gdb-7.8.1', for version 7.8.1).

C.5 'configure' Options
=======================

Here is a summary of the 'configure' options and arguments that are most
often useful for building GDB.  'configure' also has several other
options not listed here.  *note (configure.info)What Configure Does::,
for a full explanation of 'configure'.

     configure [--help]
               [--prefix=DIR]
               [--exec-prefix=DIR]
               [--srcdir=DIRNAME]
               [--norecursion] [--rm]
               [--target=TARGET]
               HOST

You may introduce options with a single '-' rather than '--' if you
prefer; but you may abbreviate option names if you use '--'.

'--help'
     Display a quick summary of how to invoke 'configure'.

'--prefix=DIR'
     Configure the source to install programs and files under directory
     'DIR'.

'--exec-prefix=DIR'
     Configure the source to install programs under directory 'DIR'.

'--srcdir=DIRNAME'
     *Warning: using this option requires GNU 'make', or another 'make'
     that implements the 'VPATH' feature.*
     Use this option to make configurations in directories separate from
     the GDB source directories.  Among other things, you can use this
     to build (or maintain) several configurations simultaneously, in
     separate directories.  'configure' writes configuration-specific
     files in the current directory, but arranges for them to use the
     source in the directory DIRNAME.  'configure' creates directories
     under the working directory in parallel to the source directories
     below DIRNAME.

'--norecursion'
     Configure only the directory level where 'configure' is executed;
     do not propagate configuration to subdirectories.

'--target=TARGET'
     Configure GDB for cross-debugging programs running on the specified
     TARGET.  Without this option, GDB is configured to debug programs
     that run on the same machine (HOST) as GDB itself.

     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available
     targets.

'HOST ...'
     Configure GDB to run on the specified HOST.

     There is no convenient way to generate a list of all available
     hosts.

   There are many other options available as well, but they are
generally needed for special purposes only.


File: gdb.info,  Node: System-wide configuration,  Prev: Configure Options,  Up: Installing GDB

C.6 System-wide configuration and settings
==========================================

GDB can be configured to have a system-wide init file; this file will be
read and executed at startup (*note What GDB does during startup:
Startup.).

   Here is the corresponding configure option:

'--with-system-gdbinit=FILE'
     Specify that the default location of the system-wide init file is
     FILE.

   If GDB has been configured with the option '--prefix=$prefix', it may
be subject to relocation.  Two possible cases:

   * If the default location of this init file contains '$prefix', it
     will be subject to relocation.  Suppose that the configure options
     are '--prefix=$prefix --with-system-gdbinit=$prefix/etc/gdbinit';
     if GDB is moved from '$prefix' to '$install', the system init file
     is looked for as '$install/etc/gdbinit' instead of
     '$prefix/etc/gdbinit'.

   * By contrast, if the default location does not contain the prefix,
     it will not be relocated.  E.g. if GDB has been configured with
     '--prefix=/usr/local --with-system-gdbinit=/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit',
     then GDB will always look for '/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit', wherever
     GDB is installed.

   If the configured location of the system-wide init file (as given by
the '--with-system-gdbinit' option at configure time) is in the
data-directory (as specified by '--with-gdb-datadir' at configure time)
or in one of its subdirectories, then GDB will look for the system-wide
init file in the directory specified by the '--data-directory'
command-line option.  Note that the system-wide init file is only read
once, during GDB initialization.  If the data-directory is changed after
GDB has started with the 'set data-directory' command, the file will not
be reread.

* System-wide Configuration Scripts::  Installed System-wide Configuration Scripts


File: gdb.info,  Node: System-wide Configuration Scripts,  Up: System-wide configuration

C.6.1 Installed System-wide Configuration Scripts
-------------------------------------------------

The 'system-gdbinit' directory, located inside the data-directory (as
specified by '--with-gdb-datadir' at configure time) contains a number
of scripts which can be used as system-wide init files.  To
automatically source those scripts at startup, GDB should be configured
with '--with-system-gdbinit'.  Otherwise, any user should be able to
source them by hand as needed.

   The following scripts are currently available:

   * 'elinos.py' This script is useful when debugging a program on an
     ELinOS target.  It takes advantage of the environment variables
     defined in a standard ELinOS environment in order to determine the
     location of the system shared libraries, and then sets the
     'solib-absolute-prefix' and 'solib-search-path' variables
     appropriately.

   * 'wrs-linux.py' This script is useful when debugging a program on a
     target running Wind River Linux.  It expects the 'ENV_PREFIX' to be
     set to the host-side sysroot used by the target system.

Appendix D Maintenance Commands
*******************************

In addition to commands intended for GDB users, GDB includes a number of
commands intended for GDB developers, that are not documented elsewhere
in this manual.  These commands are provided here for reference.  (For
commands that turn on debugging messages, see *note Debugging Output::.)

'maint agent [-at LOCATION,] EXPRESSION'
'maint agent-eval [-at LOCATION,] EXPRESSION'
     Translate the given EXPRESSION into remote agent bytecodes.  This
     command is useful for debugging the Agent Expression mechanism
     (*note Agent Expressions::).  The 'agent' version produces an
     expression useful for data collection, such as by tracepoints,
     while 'maint agent-eval' produces an expression that evaluates
     directly to a result.  For instance, a collection expression for
     'globa + globb' will include bytecodes to record four bytes of
     memory at each of the addresses of 'globa' and 'globb', while
     discarding the result of the addition, while an evaluation
     expression will do the addition and return the sum.  If '-at' is
     given, generate remote agent bytecode for LOCATION.  If not,
     generate remote agent bytecode for current frame PC address.

'maint agent-printf FORMAT,EXPR,...'
     Translate the given format string and list of argument expressions
     into remote agent bytecodes and display them as a disassembled
     list.  This command is useful for debugging the agent version of
     dynamic printf (*note Dynamic Printf::).

'maint info breakpoints'
     Using the same format as 'info breakpoints', display both the
     breakpoints you've set explicitly, and those GDB is using for
     internal purposes.  Internal breakpoints are shown with negative
     breakpoint numbers.  The type column identifies what kind of
     breakpoint is shown:

     'breakpoint'
          Normal, explicitly set breakpoint.

     'watchpoint'
          Normal, explicitly set watchpoint.

     'longjmp'
          Internal breakpoint, used to handle correctly stepping through
          'longjmp' calls.

     'longjmp resume'
          Internal breakpoint at the target of a 'longjmp'.

     'until'
          Temporary internal breakpoint used by the GDB 'until' command.

     'finish'
          Temporary internal breakpoint used by the GDB 'finish'
          command.

     'shlib events'
          Shared library events.

'maint info bfds'
     This prints information about each 'bfd' object that is known to
     GDB.  *Note BFD: (bfd)Top.

'set displaced-stepping'
'show displaced-stepping'
     Control whether or not GDB will do "displaced stepping" if the
     target supports it.  Displaced stepping is a way to single-step
     over breakpoints without removing them from the inferior, by
     executing an out-of-line copy of the instruction that was
     originally at the breakpoint location.  It is also known as
     out-of-line single-stepping.

     'set displaced-stepping on'
          If the target architecture supports it, GDB will use displaced
          stepping to step over breakpoints.

     'set displaced-stepping off'
          GDB will not use displaced stepping to step over breakpoints,
          even if such is supported by the target architecture.

     'set displaced-stepping auto'
          This is the default mode.  GDB will use displaced stepping
          only if non-stop mode is active (*note Non-Stop Mode::) and
          the target architecture supports displaced stepping.

'maint check-psymtabs'
     Check the consistency of currently expanded psymtabs versus
     symtabs.  Use this to check, for example, whether a symbol is in
     one but not the other.

'maint check-symtabs'
     Check the consistency of currently expanded symtabs.

'maint expand-symtabs [REGEXP]'
     Expand symbol tables.  If REGEXP is specified, only expand symbol
     tables for file names matching REGEXP.

'maint cplus first_component NAME'
     Print the first C++ class/namespace component of NAME.

'maint cplus namespace'
     Print the list of possible C++ namespaces.

'maint demangle NAME'
     Demangle a C++ or Objective-C mangled NAME.

'maint deprecate COMMAND [REPLACEMENT]'
'maint undeprecate COMMAND'
     Deprecate or undeprecate the named COMMAND.  Deprecated commands
     cause GDB to issue a warning when you use them.  The optional
     argument REPLACEMENT says which newer command should be used in
     favor of the deprecated one; if it is given, GDB will mention the
     replacement as part of the warning.

'maint dump-me'
     Cause a fatal signal in the debugger and force it to dump its core.
     This is supported only on systems which support aborting a program
     with the 'SIGQUIT' signal.

'maint internal-error [MESSAGE-TEXT]'
'maint internal-warning [MESSAGE-TEXT]'
     Cause GDB to call the internal function 'internal_error' or
     'internal_warning' and hence behave as though an internal error or
     internal warning has been detected.  In addition to reporting the
     internal problem, these functions give the user the opportunity to
     either quit GDB or create a core file of the current GDB session.

     These commands take an optional parameter MESSAGE-TEXT that is used
     as the text of the error or warning message.

     Here's an example of using 'internal-error':

          (gdb) maint internal-error testing, 1, 2
          .../maint.c:121: internal-error: testing, 1, 2
          A problem internal to GDB has been detected.  Further
          debugging may prove unreliable.
          Quit this debugging session? (y or n) n
          Create a core file? (y or n) n
          (gdb)

'maint set internal-error ACTION [ask|yes|no]'
'maint show internal-error ACTION'
'maint set internal-warning ACTION [ask|yes|no]'
'maint show internal-warning ACTION'
     When GDB reports an internal problem (error or warning) it gives
     the user the opportunity to both quit GDB and create a core file of
     the current GDB session.  These commands let you override the
     default behaviour for each particular ACTION, described in the
     table below.

     'quit'
          You can specify that GDB should always (yes) or never (no)
          quit.  The default is to ask the user what to do.

     'corefile'
          You can specify that GDB should always (yes) or never (no)
          create a core file.  The default is to ask the user what to
          do.

'maint packet TEXT'
     If GDB is talking to an inferior via the serial protocol, then this
     command sends the string TEXT to the inferior, and displays the
     response packet.  GDB supplies the initial '$' character, the
     terminating '#' character, and the checksum.

'maint print architecture [FILE]'
     Print the entire architecture configuration.  The optional argument
     FILE names the file where the output goes.

'maint print c-tdesc'
     Print the current target description (*note Target Descriptions::)
     as a C source file.  The created source file can be used in GDB
     when an XML parser is not available to parse the description.

'maint print dummy-frames'
     Prints the contents of GDB's internal dummy-frame stack.

          (gdb) b add
          ...
          (gdb) print add(2,3)
          Breakpoint 2, add (a=2, b=3) at ...
          58	  return (a + b);
          The program being debugged stopped while in a function called from GDB.
          ...
          (gdb) maint print dummy-frames
          0x1a57c80: pc=0x01014068 fp=0x0200bddc sp=0x0200bdd6
           top=0x0200bdd4 id={stack=0x200bddc,code=0x101405c}
           call_lo=0x01014000 call_hi=0x01014001
          (gdb)

     Takes an optional file parameter.

'maint print registers [FILE]'
'maint print raw-registers [FILE]'
'maint print cooked-registers [FILE]'
'maint print register-groups [FILE]'
'maint print remote-registers [FILE]'
     Print GDB's internal register data structures.

     The command 'maint print raw-registers' includes the contents of
     the raw register cache; the command 'maint print cooked-registers'
     includes the (cooked) value of all registers, including registers
     which aren't available on the target nor visible to user; the
     command 'maint print register-groups' includes the groups that each
     register is a member of; and the command 'maint print
     remote-registers' includes the remote target's register numbers and
     offsets in the 'G' packets.

     These commands take an optional parameter, a file name to which to
     write the information.

'maint print reggroups [FILE]'
     Print GDB's internal register group data structures.  The optional
     argument FILE tells to what file to write the information.

     The register groups info looks like this:

          (gdb) maint print reggroups
           Group      Type
           general    user
           float      user
           all        user
           vector     user
           system     user
           save       internal
           restore    internal

'flushregs'
     This command forces GDB to flush its internal register cache.

'maint print objfiles [REGEXP]'
     Print a dump of all known object files.  If REGEXP is specified,
     only print object files whose names match REGEXP.  For each object
     file, this command prints its name, address in memory, and all of
     its psymtabs and symtabs.

'maint print section-scripts [REGEXP]'
     Print a dump of scripts specified in the '.debug_gdb_section'
     section.  If REGEXP is specified, only print scripts loaded by
     object files matching REGEXP.  For each script, this command prints
     its name as specified in the objfile, and the full path if known.
     *Note dotdebug_gdb_scripts section::.

'maint print statistics'
     This command prints, for each object file in the program, various
     data about that object file followed by the byte cache ("bcache")
     statistics for the object file.  The objfile data includes the
     number of minimal, partial, full, and stabs symbols, the number of
     types defined by the objfile, the number of as yet unexpanded psym
     tables, the number of line tables and string tables, and the amount
     of memory used by the various tables.  The bcache statistics
     include the counts, sizes, and counts of duplicates of all and
     unique objects, max, average, and median entry size, total memory
     used and its overhead and savings, and various measures of the hash
     table size and chain lengths.

'maint print target-stack'
     A "target" is an interface between the debugger and a particular
     kind of file or process.  Targets can be stacked in "strata", so
     that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.  In
     particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
     until they find a target that is interested in handling that
     particular address.

     This command prints a short description of each layer that was
     pushed on the "target stack", starting from the top layer down to
     the bottom one.

'maint print type EXPR'
     Print the type chain for a type specified by EXPR.  The argument
     can be either a type name or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, the type
     of that symbol is described.  The type chain produced by this
     command is a recursive definition of the data type as stored in
     GDB's data structures, including its flags and contained types.

'maint set dwarf2 always-disassemble'
'maint show dwarf2 always-disassemble'
     Control the behavior of 'info address' when using DWARF debugging
     information.

     The default is 'off', which means that GDB should try to describe a
     variable's location in an easily readable format.  When 'on', GDB
     will instead display the DWARF location expression in an
     assembly-like format.  Note that some locations are too complex for
     GDB to describe simply; in this case you will always see the
     disassembly form.

     Here is an example of the resulting disassembly:

          (gdb) info addr argc
          Symbol "argc" is a complex DWARF expression:
               1: DW_OP_fbreg 0

     For more information on these expressions, see the DWARF standard
     (http://www.dwarfstd.org/).

'maint set dwarf2 max-cache-age'
'maint show dwarf2 max-cache-age'
     Control the DWARF 2 compilation unit cache.

     In object files with inter-compilation-unit references, such as
     those produced by the GCC option '-feliminate-dwarf2-dups', the
     DWARF 2 reader needs to frequently refer to previously read
     compilation units.  This setting controls how long a compilation
     unit will remain in the cache if it is not referenced.  A higher
     limit means that cached compilation units will be stored in memory
     longer, and more total memory will be used.  Setting it to zero
     disables caching, which will slow down GDB startup, but reduce
     memory consumption.

'maint set profile'
'maint show profile'
     Control profiling of GDB.

     Profiling will be disabled until you use the 'maint set profile'
     command to enable it.  When you enable profiling, the system will
     begin collecting timing and execution count data; when you disable
     profiling or exit GDB, the results will be written to a log file.
     Remember that if you use profiling, GDB will overwrite the
     profiling log file (often called 'gmon.out').  If you have a record
     of important profiling data in a 'gmon.out' file, be sure to move
     it to a safe location.

     Configuring with '--enable-profiling' arranges for GDB to be
     compiled with the '-pg' compiler option.

'maint set show-debug-regs'
'maint show show-debug-regs'
     Control whether to show variables that mirror the hardware debug
     registers.  Use 'on' to enable, 'off' to disable.  If enabled, the
     debug registers values are shown when GDB inserts or removes a
     hardware breakpoint or watchpoint, and when the inferior triggers a
     hardware-assisted breakpoint or watchpoint.

'maint set show-all-tib'
'maint show show-all-tib'
     Control whether to show all non zero areas within a 1k block
     starting at thread local base, when using the 'info w32
     thread-information-block' command.

'maint set target-async'
'maint show target-async'
     This controls whether GDB targets operate in synchronous or
     asynchronous mode (*note Background Execution::).  Normally the
     default is asynchronous, if it is available; but this can be
     changed to more easily debug problems occurring only in synchronous
     mode.

'maint set per-command'
'maint show per-command'

     GDB can display the resources used by each command.  This is useful
     in debugging performance problems.

     'maint set per-command space [on|off]'
     'maint show per-command space'
          Enable or disable the printing of the memory used by GDB for
          each command.  If enabled, GDB will display how much memory
          each command took, following the command's own output.  This
          can also be requested by invoking GDB with the '--statistics'
          command-line switch (*note Mode Options::).

     'maint set per-command time [on|off]'
     'maint show per-command time'
          Enable or disable the printing of the execution time of GDB
          for each command.  If enabled, GDB will display how much time
          it took to execute each command, following the command's own
          output.  Both CPU time and wallclock time are printed.
          Printing both is useful when trying to determine whether the
          cost is CPU or, e.g., disk/network latency.  Note that the CPU
          time printed is for GDB only, it does not include the
          execution time of the inferior because there's no mechanism
          currently to compute how much time was spent by GDB and how
          much time was spent by the program been debugged.  This can
          also be requested by invoking GDB with the '--statistics'
          command-line switch (*note Mode Options::).

     'maint set per-command symtab [on|off]'
     'maint show per-command symtab'
          Enable or disable the printing of basic symbol table
          statistics for each command.  If enabled, GDB will display the
          following information:

            a. number of symbol tables
            b. number of primary symbol tables
            c. number of blocks in the blockvector

'maint space VALUE'
     An alias for 'maint set per-command space'.  A non-zero value
     enables it, zero disables it.

'maint time VALUE'
     An alias for 'maint set per-command time'.  A non-zero value
     enables it, zero disables it.

'maint translate-address [SECTION] ADDR'
     Find the symbol stored at the location specified by the address
     ADDR and an optional section name SECTION.  If found, GDB prints
     the name of the closest symbol and an offset from the symbol's
     location to the specified address.  This is similar to the 'info
     address' command (*note Symbols::), except that this command also
     allows to find symbols in other sections.

     If section was not specified, the section in which the symbol was
     found is also printed.  For dynamically linked executables, the
     name of executable or shared library containing the symbol is
     printed as well.

   The following command is useful for non-interactive invocations of
GDB, such as in the test suite.

'set watchdog NSEC'
     Set the maximum number of seconds GDB will wait for the target
     operation to finish.  If this time expires, GDB reports and error
     and the command is aborted.

'show watchdog'
     Show the current setting of the target wait timeout.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Overview,  Next: Packets,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.1 Overview
============

There may be occasions when you need to know something about the
protocol--for example, if there is only one serial port to your target
machine, you might want your program to do something special if it
recognizes a packet meant for GDB.

   In the examples below, '->' and '<-' are used to indicate transmitted
and received data, respectively.

   All GDB commands and responses (other than acknowledgments and
notifications, see *note Notification Packets::) are sent as a PACKET.
A PACKET is introduced with the character '$', the actual PACKET-DATA,
and the terminating character '#' followed by a two-digit CHECKSUM:

     $PACKET-DATA#CHECKSUM

The two-digit CHECKSUM is computed as the modulo 256 sum of all
characters between the leading '$' and the trailing '#' (an eight bit
unsigned checksum).

   Implementors should note that prior to GDB 5.0 the protocol
specification also included an optional two-digit SEQUENCE-ID:

     $SEQUENCE-ID:PACKET-DATA#CHECKSUM

That SEQUENCE-ID was appended to the acknowledgment.  GDB has never
output SEQUENCE-IDs.  Stubs that handle packets added since GDB 5.0 must
not accept SEQUENCE-ID.

   When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the
first response expected is an acknowledgment: either '+' (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or '-' (to request retransmission):

     -> $PACKET-DATA#CHECKSUM
     <- +

   The '+'/'-' acknowledgments can be disabled once a connection is
established.  *Note Packet Acknowledgment::, for details.

   The host (GDB) sends COMMANDs, and the target (the debugging stub
incorporated in your program) sends a RESPONSE.  In the case of step and
continue COMMANDs, the response is only sent when the operation has
completed, and the target has again stopped all threads in all attached
processes.  This is the default all-stop mode behavior, but the remote
protocol also supports GDB's non-stop execution mode; see *note Remote
Non-Stop::, for details.

   PACKET-DATA consists of a sequence of characters with the exception
of '#' and '$' (see 'X' packet for additional exceptions).

   Fields within the packet should be separated using ',' ';' or ':'.
Except where otherwise noted all numbers are represented in HEX with
leading zeros suppressed.

   Implementors should note that prior to GDB 5.0, the character ':'
could not appear as the third character in a packet (as it would
potentially conflict with the SEQUENCE-ID).

   Binary data in most packets is encoded either as two hexadecimal
digits per byte of binary data.  This allowed the traditional remote
protocol to work over connections which were only seven-bit clean.  Some
packets designed more recently assume an eight-bit clean connection, and
use a more efficient encoding to send and receive binary data.

   The binary data representation uses '7d' (ASCII '}') as an escape
character.  Any escaped byte is transmitted as the escape character
followed by the original character XORed with '0x20'.  For example, the
byte '0x7d' would be transmitted as the two bytes '0x7d 0x5d'.  The
bytes '0x23' (ASCII '#'), '0x24' (ASCII '$'), and '0x7d' (ASCII '}')
must always be escaped.  Responses sent by the stub must also escape
'0x2a' (ASCII '*'), so that it is not interpreted as the start of a
run-length encoded sequence (described next).

   Response DATA can be run-length encoded to save space.  Run-length
encoding replaces runs of identical characters with one instance of the
repeated character, followed by a '*' and a repeat count.  The repeat
count is itself sent encoded, to avoid binary characters in DATA: a
value of N is sent as 'N+29'.  For a repeat count greater or equal to 3,
this produces a printable ASCII character, e.g. a space (ASCII code 32)
for a repeat count of 3.  (This is because run-length encoding starts to
win for counts 3 or more.)  Thus, for example, '0* ' is a run-length
encoding of "0000": the space character after '*' means repeat the
leading '0' '32 - 29 = 3' more times.

   The printable characters '#' and '$' or with a numeric value greater
than 126 must not be used.  Runs of six repeats ('#') or seven repeats
('$') can be expanded using a repeat count of only five ('"').  For
example, '00000000' can be encoded as '0*"00'.

   The error response returned for some packets includes a two character
error number.  That number is not well defined.

   For any COMMAND not supported by the stub, an empty response ('$#00')
should be returned.  That way it is possible to extend the protocol.  A
newer GDB can tell if a packet is supported based on that response.

   At a minimum, a stub is required to support the 'g' and 'G' commands
for register access, and the 'm' and 'M' commands for memory access.
Stubs that only control single-threaded targets can implement run
control with the 'c' (continue), and 's' (step) commands.  Stubs that
support multi-threading targets should support the 'vCont' command.  All
other commands are optional.

E.2 Packets
===========

The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
COMMANDs and their corresponding response DATA.  *Note File-I/O Remote
Protocol Extension::, for details about the File I/O extension of the
remote protocol.

   Each packet's description has a template showing the packet's overall
syntax, followed by an explanation of the packet's meaning.  We include
spaces in some of the templates for clarity; these are not part of the
packet's syntax.  No GDB packet uses spaces to separate its components.
For example, a template like 'foo BAR BAZ' describes a packet beginning
with the three ASCII bytes 'foo', followed by a BAR, followed directly
by a BAZ.  GDB does not transmit a space character between the 'foo' and
the BAR, or between the BAR and the BAZ.

   Several packets and replies include a THREAD-ID field to identify a
thread.  Normally these are positive numbers with a target-specific
interpretation, formatted as big-endian hex strings.  A THREAD-ID can
also be a literal '-1' to indicate all threads, or '0' to pick any
thread.

   In addition, the remote protocol supports a multiprocess feature in
which the THREAD-ID syntax is extended to optionally include both
process and thread ID fields, as 'pPID.TID'.  The PID (process) and TID
(thread) components each have the format described above: a positive
number with target-specific interpretation formatted as a big-endian hex
string, literal '-1' to indicate all processes or threads
(respectively), or '0' to indicate an arbitrary process or thread.
Specifying just a process, as 'pPID', is equivalent to 'pPID.-1'.  It is
an error to specify all processes but a specific thread, such as
'p-1.TID'.  Note that the 'p' prefix is _not_ used for those packets and
replies explicitly documented to include a process ID, rather than a
THREAD-ID.

   The multiprocess THREAD-ID syntax extensions are only used if both
GDB and the stub report support for the 'multiprocess' feature using
'qSupported'.  *Note multiprocess extensions::, for more information.

   Note that all packet forms beginning with an upper- or lower-case
letter, other than those described here, are reserved for future use.

   Here are the packet descriptions.

'!'
     Enable extended mode.  In extended mode, the remote server is made
     persistent.  The 'R' packet is used to restart the program being
     debugged.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The remote target both supports and has enabled extended mode.

'?'
     Indicate the reason the target halted.  The reply is the same as
     for step and continue.  This packet has a special interpretation
     when the target is in non-stop mode; see *note Remote Non-Stop::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'A ARGLEN,ARGNUM,ARG,...'
     Initialized 'argv[]' array passed into program.  ARGLEN specifies
     the number of bytes in the hex encoded byte stream ARG.  See
     'gdbserver' for more details.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The arguments were set.
     'E NN'
          An error occurred.

'b BAUD'
     (Don't use this packet; its behavior is not well-defined.)  Change
     the serial line speed to BAUD.

     JTC: _When does the transport layer state change?  When it's
     received, or after the ACK is transmitted.  In either case, there
     are problems if the command or the acknowledgment packet is
     dropped._

     Stan: _If people really wanted to add something like this, and get
     it working for the first time, they ought to modify ser-unix.c to
     send some kind of out-of-band message to a specially-setup stub and
     have the switch happen "in between" packets, so that from remote
     protocol's point of view, nothing actually happened._

'B ADDR,MODE'
     Set (MODE is 'S') or clear (MODE is 'C') a breakpoint at ADDR.

     Don't use this packet.  Use the 'Z' and 'z' packets instead (*note
     insert breakpoint or watchpoint packet::).

'bc'
     Backward continue.  Execute the target system in reverse.  No
     parameter.  *Note Reverse Execution::, for more information.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'bs'
     Backward single step.  Execute one instruction in reverse.  No
     parameter.  *Note Reverse Execution::, for more information.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'c [ADDR]'
     Continue at ADDR, which is the address to resume.  If ADDR is
     omitted, resume at current address.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'C SIG[;ADDR]'
     Continue with signal SIG (hex signal number).  If ';ADDR' is
     omitted, resume at same address.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'd'
     Toggle debug flag.

     Don't use this packet; instead, define a general set packet (*note
     General Query Packets::).

'D'
'D;PID'
     The first form of the packet is used to detach GDB from the remote
     system.  It is sent to the remote target before GDB disconnects via
     the 'detach' command.

     The second form, including a process ID, is used when multiprocess
     protocol extensions are enabled (*note multiprocess extensions::),
     to detach only a specific process.  The PID is specified as a
     big-endian hex string.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'F RC,EE,CF;XX'
     A reply from GDB to an 'F' packet sent by the target.  This is part
     of the File-I/O protocol extension.  *Note File-I/O Remote Protocol
     Extension::, for the specification.

'g'
     Read general registers.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Each byte of register data is described by two hex digits.
          The bytes with the register are transmitted in target byte
          order.  The size of each register and their position within
          the 'g' packet are determined by the GDB internal gdbarch
          functions 'DEPRECATED_REGISTER_RAW_SIZE' and
          'gdbarch_register_name'.  The specification of several
          standard 'g' packets is specified below.

          When reading registers from a trace frame (*note Using the
          Collected Data: Analyze Collected Data.), the stub may also
          return a string of literal 'x''s in place of the register data
          digits, to indicate that the corresponding register has not
          been collected, thus its value is unavailable.  For example,
          for an architecture with 4 registers of 4 bytes each, the
          following reply indicates to GDB that registers 0 and 2 have
          not been collected, while registers 1 and 3 have been
          collected, and both have zero value:

               -> g
               <- xxxxxxxx00000000xxxxxxxx00000000

'H OP THREAD-ID'
     Set thread for subsequent operations ('m', 'M', 'g', 'G', et.al.).
     Depending on the operation to be performed, OP should be 'c' for
     step and continue operations (note that this is deprecated,
     supporting the 'vCont' command is a better option), and 'g' for
     other operations.  The thread designator THREAD-ID has the format
     and interpretation described in *note thread-id syntax::.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'i [ADDR[,NNN]]'
     Step the remote target by a single clock cycle.  If ',NNN' is
     present, cycle step NNN cycles.  If ADDR is present, cycle step
     starting at that address.

'I'
     Signal, then cycle step.  *Note step with signal packet::.  *Note
     cycle step packet::.

'k'
     Kill request.

     The exact effect of this packet is not specified.

     For a bare-metal target, it may power cycle or reset the target
     system.  For that reason, the 'k' packet has no reply.

     For a single-process target, it may kill that process if possible.

     A multiple-process target may choose to kill just one process, or
     all that are under GDB's control.  For more precise control, use
     the vKill packet (*note vKill packet::).

     If the target system immediately closes the connection in response
     to 'k', GDB does not consider the lack of packet acknowledgment to
     be an error, and assumes the kill was successful.

     If connected using 'target extended-remote', and the target does
     not close the connection in response to a kill request, GDB probes
     the target state as if a new connection was opened (*note ?
     packet::).

'm ADDR,LENGTH'
     Read LENGTH bytes of memory starting at address ADDR.  Note that
     ADDR may not be aligned to any particular boundary.

     The stub need not use any particular size or alignment when
     gathering data from memory for the response; even if ADDR is
     word-aligned and LENGTH is a multiple of the word size, the stub is
     free to use byte accesses, or not.  For this reason, this packet
     may not be suitable for accessing memory-mapped I/O devices.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Memory contents; each byte is transmitted as a two-digit
          hexadecimal number.  The reply may contain fewer bytes than
          requested if the server was able to read only part of the
          region of memory.
     'E NN'
          NN is errno

'M ADDR,LENGTH:XX...'
     Write LENGTH bytes of memory starting at address ADDR.  The data is
     given by XX...; each byte is transmitted as a two-digit hexadecimal
     number.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error (this includes the case where only part of the
          data was written).

'p N'
     Read the value of register N; N is in hex.  *Note read registers
     packet::, for a description of how the returned register value is
     encoded.

     Reply:

     ''
          Indicating an unrecognized QUERY.

'P N...=R...'
     Write register N... with value R....  The register number N is in
     hexadecimal, and R... contains two hex digits for each byte in the
     register (target byte order).

'q NAME PARAMS...'
'Q NAME PARAMS...'
     General query ('q') and set ('Q').  These packets are described
     fully in *note General Query Packets::.

'r'
     Reset the entire system.

     Don't use this packet; use the 'R' packet instead.

'R XX'
     Restart the program being debugged.  The XX, while needed, is
     ignored.  This packet is only available in extended mode (*note
     extended mode::).

     The 'R' packet has no reply.

's [ADDR]'
     Single step, resuming at ADDR.  If ADDR is omitted, resume at same
     address.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'S SIG[;ADDR]'
     Step with signal.  This is analogous to the 'C' packet, but
     requests a single-step, rather than a normal resumption of
     execution.

     This packet is deprecated for multi-threading support.  *Note vCont
     packet::.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

't ADDR:PP,MM'
     Search backwards starting at address ADDR for a match with pattern
     PP and mask MM, both of which are are 4 byte long.  There must be
     at least 3 digits in ADDR.

'T THREAD-ID'
     Find out if the thread THREAD-ID is alive.  *Note thread-id
     syntax::.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          thread is still alive
     'E NN'
          thread is dead

'v'
     Packets starting with 'v' are identified by a multi-letter name, up
     to the first ';' or '?' (or the end of the packet).

'vAttach;PID'
     Attach to a new process with the specified process ID PID.  The
     process ID is a hexadecimal integer identifying the process.  In
     all-stop mode, all threads in the attached process are stopped; in
     non-stop mode, it may be attached without being stopped if that is
     supported by the target.

     This packet is only available in extended mode (*note extended
     mode::).

     Reply:
     'E NN'
          for an error
     'Any stop packet'
          for success in all-stop mode (*note Stop Reply Packets::)
     'OK'
          for success in non-stop mode (*note Remote Non-Stop::)

'vCont[;ACTION[:THREAD-ID]]...'
     Resume the inferior, specifying different actions for each thread.
     If an action is specified with no THREAD-ID, then it is applied to
     any threads that don't have a specific action specified; if no
     default action is specified then other threads should remain
     stopped in all-stop mode and in their current state in non-stop
     mode.  Specifying multiple default actions is an error; specifying
     no actions is also an error.  Thread IDs are specified using the
     syntax described in *note thread-id syntax::.

     Currently supported actions are:

     'c'
          Continue.
     'C SIG'
          Continue with signal SIG.  The signal SIG should be two hex
          digits.
     's'
          Step.
     'S SIG'
          Step with signal SIG.  The signal SIG should be two hex
          digits.
     't'
          Stop.
     'r START,END'
          Step once, and then keep stepping as long as the thread stops
          at addresses between START (inclusive) and END (exclusive).
          The remote stub reports a stop reply when either the thread
          goes out of the range or is stopped due to an unrelated
          reason, such as hitting a breakpoint.  *Note range stepping::.

          If the range is empty (START == END), then the action becomes
          equivalent to the 's' action.  In other words, single-step
          once, and report the stop (even if the stepped instruction
          jumps to START).

          (A stop reply may be sent at any point even if the PC is still
          within the stepping range; for example, it is valid to
          implement this packet in a degenerate way as a single
          instruction step operation.)

     The optional argument ADDR normally associated with the 'c', 'C',
     's', and 'S' packets is not supported in 'vCont'.

     The 't' action is only relevant in non-stop mode (*note Remote
     Non-Stop::) and may be ignored by the stub otherwise.  A stop reply
     should be generated for any affected thread not already stopped.
     When a thread is stopped by means of a 't' action, the
     corresponding stop reply should indicate that the thread has
     stopped with signal '0', regardless of whether the target uses some
     other signal as an implementation detail.

     The stub must support 'vCont' if it reports support for
     multiprocess extensions (*note multiprocess extensions::).  Note
     that in this case 'vCont' actions can be specified to apply to all
     threads in a process by using the 'pPID.-1' form of the THREAD-ID.

     Reply: *Note Stop Reply Packets::, for the reply specifications.

'vCont?'
     Request a list of actions supported by the 'vCont' packet.

     Reply:
     'vCont[;ACTION...]'
          The 'vCont' packet is supported.  Each ACTION is a supported
          command in the 'vCont' packet.
     ''
          The 'vCont' packet is not supported.

'vFile:OPERATION:PARAMETER...'
     Perform a file operation on the target system.  For details, see
     *note Host I/O Packets::.

'vFlashErase:ADDR,LENGTH'
     Direct the stub to erase LENGTH bytes of flash starting at ADDR.
     The region may enclose any number of flash blocks, but its start
     and end must fall on block boundaries, as indicated by the flash
     block size appearing in the memory map (*note Memory Map Format::).
     GDB groups flash memory programming operations together, and sends
     a 'vFlashDone' request after each group; the stub is allowed to
     delay erase operation until the 'vFlashDone' packet is received.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          for success
     'E NN'
          for an error

'vFlashWrite:ADDR:XX...'
     Direct the stub to write data to flash address ADDR.  The data is
     passed in binary form using the same encoding as for the 'X' packet
     (*note Binary Data::).  The memory ranges specified by
     'vFlashWrite' packets preceding a 'vFlashDone' packet must not
     overlap, and must appear in order of increasing addresses (although
     'vFlashErase' packets for higher addresses may already have been
     received; the ordering is guaranteed only between 'vFlashWrite'
     packets).  If a packet writes to an address that was neither erased
     by a preceding 'vFlashErase' packet nor by some other
     target-specific method, the results are unpredictable.

'vFlashDone'
     Indicate to the stub that flash programming operation is finished.
     The stub is permitted to delay or batch the effects of a group of
     'vFlashErase' and 'vFlashWrite' packets until a 'vFlashDone' packet
     is received.  The contents of the affected regions of flash memory
     are unpredictable until the 'vFlashDone' request is completed.

'vKill;PID'
     Kill the process with the specified process ID PID, which is a
     hexadecimal integer identifying the process.  This packet is used
     in preference to 'k' when multiprocess protocol extensions are
     supported; see *note multiprocess extensions::.

     Reply:
     'E NN'
          for an error
     'OK'
          for success

'vRun;FILENAME[;ARGUMENT]...'
     Run the program FILENAME, passing it each ARGUMENT on its command
     line.  The file and arguments are hex-encoded strings.  If FILENAME
     is an empty string, the stub may use a default program (e.g. the
     last program run).  The program is created in the stopped state.

     This packet is only available in extended mode (*note extended
     mode::).

'z TYPE,ADDR,KIND'
'Z TYPE,ADDR,KIND'
     Insert ('Z') or remove ('z') a TYPE breakpoint or watchpoint
     starting at address ADDRESS of kind KIND.

     Each breakpoint and watchpoint packet TYPE is documented
     separately.

     _Implementation notes: A remote target shall return an empty string
     for an unrecognized breakpoint or watchpoint packet TYPE.  A remote
     target shall support either both or neither of a given 'ZTYPE...'
     and 'zTYPE...' packet pair.  To avoid potential problems with
     duplicate packets, the operations should be implemented in an
     idempotent way._

'z0,ADDR,KIND'
'Z0,ADDR,KIND[;COND_LIST...][;cmds:PERSIST,CMD_LIST...]'
     Insert ('Z0') or remove ('z0') a memory breakpoint at address ADDR
     of type KIND.

     A memory breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction at
     ADDR with a software breakpoint or trap instruction.  The KIND is
     target-specific and typically indicates the size of the breakpoint
     in bytes that should be inserted.  E.g., the ARM and MIPS can
     insert either a 2 or 4 byte breakpoint.  Some architectures have
     additional meanings for KIND; COND_LIST is an optional list of
     conditional expressions in bytecode form that should be evaluated
     on the target's side.  These are the conditions that should be
     taken into consideration when deciding if the breakpoint trigger
     should be reported back to GDBN.

     The COND_LIST parameter is comprised of a series of expressions,
     concatenated without separators.  Each expression has the following
     form:

     'X LEN,EXPR'
          LEN is the length of the bytecode expression and EXPR is the
          actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     The optional CMD_LIST parameter introduces commands that may be run
     on the target, rather than being reported back to GDB.  The
     parameter starts with a numeric flag PERSIST; if the flag is
     nonzero, then the breakpoint may remain active and the commands
     continue to be run even when GDB disconnects from the target.
     Following this flag is a series of expressions concatenated with no
     separators.  Each expression has the following form:

     'X LEN,EXPR'
          LEN is the length of the bytecode expression and EXPR is the
          actual conditional expression in bytecode form.

     see *note Architecture-Specific Protocol Details::.

     _Implementation note: It is possible for a target to copy or move
     code that contains memory breakpoints (e.g., when implementing
     overlays).  The behavior of this packet, in the presence of such a
     target, is not defined._

'z1,ADDR,KIND'
'Z1,ADDR,KIND[;COND_LIST...]'
     Insert ('Z1') or remove ('z1') a hardware breakpoint at address
     ADDR.

     A hardware breakpoint is implemented using a mechanism that is not
     dependant on being able to modify the target's memory.  The KIND
     and COND_LIST have the same meaning as in 'Z0' packets.

     _Implementation note: A hardware breakpoint is not affected by code
     movement._

E.3 Stop Reply Packets
======================

The 'C', 'c', 'S', 's', 'vCont', 'vAttach', 'vRun', 'vStopped', and '?'
packets can receive any of the below as a reply.  Except for '?' and
'vStopped', that reply is only returned when the target halts.  In the
below the exact meaning of "signal number" is defined by the header
'include/gdb/signals.h' in the GDB source code.

   As in the description of request packets, we include spaces in the
reply templates for clarity; these are not part of the reply packet's
syntax.  No GDB stop reply packet uses spaces to separate its
components.

'S AA'
     The program received signal number AA (a two-digit hexadecimal
     number).  This is equivalent to a 'T' response with no N:R pairs.

'T AA N1:R1;N2:R2;...'
     The program received signal number AA (a two-digit hexadecimal
     number).  This is equivalent to an 'S' response, except that the
     'N:R' pairs can carry values of important registers and other
     information directly in the stop reply packet, reducing round-trip
     latency.  Single-step and breakpoint traps are reported this way.
     Each 'N:R' pair is interpreted as follows:

        * If N is a hexadecimal number, it is a register number, and the
          corresponding R gives that register's value.  The data R is a
          series of bytes in target byte order, with each byte given by
          a two-digit hex number.

        * If N is 'thread', then R is the THREAD-ID of the stopped
          thread, as specified in *note thread-id syntax::.

        * If N is 'core', then R is the hexadecimal number of the core
          on which the stop event was detected.

        * If N is a recognized "stop reason", it describes a more
          specific event that stopped the target.  The currently defined
          stop reasons are listed below.  The AA should be '05', the
          trap signal.  At most one stop reason should be present.

        * Otherwise, GDB should ignore this 'N:R' pair and go on to the
          next; this allows us to extend the protocol in the future.

     The currently defined stop reasons are:

     'watch'
     'rwatch'
     'awatch'
          The packet indicates a watchpoint hit, and R is the data
          address, in hex.

     'library'
          The packet indicates that the loaded libraries have changed.
          GDB should use 'qXfer:libraries:read' to fetch a new list of
          loaded libraries.  The R part is ignored.

     'replaylog'
          The packet indicates that the target cannot continue replaying
          logged execution events, because it has reached the end (or
          the beginning when executing backward) of the log.  The value
          of R will be either 'begin' or 'end'.  *Note Reverse
          Execution::, for more information.

'W AA'
'W AA ; process:PID'
     The process exited, and AA is the exit status.  This is only
     applicable to certain targets.

     The second form of the response, including the process ID of the
     exited process, can be used only when GDB has reported support for
     multiprocess protocol extensions; see *note multiprocess
     extensions::.  The PID is formatted as a big-endian hex string.

'X AA'
'X AA ; process:PID'
     The process terminated with signal AA.

     The second form of the response, including the process ID of the
     terminated process, can be used only when GDB has reported support
     for multiprocess protocol extensions; see *note multiprocess
     extensions::.  The PID is formatted as a big-endian hex string.

'O XX...'
     'XX...' is hex encoding of ASCII data, to be written as the
     program's console output.  This can happen at any time while the
     program is running and the debugger should continue to wait for
     'W', 'T', etc.  This reply is not permitted in non-stop mode.

'F CALL-ID,PARAMETER...'
     CALL-ID is the identifier which says which host system call should
     be called.  This is just the name of the function.  Translation
     into the correct system call is only applicable as it's defined in
     GDB.  *Note File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension::, for a list of
     implemented system calls.

     'PARAMETER...' is a list of parameters as defined for this very
     system call.

     The target replies with this packet when it expects GDB to call a
     host system call on behalf of the target.  GDB replies with an
     appropriate 'F' packet and keeps up waiting for the next reply
     packet from the target.  The latest 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's' action is
     expected to be continued.  *Note File-I/O Remote Protocol
     Extension::, for more details.

E.4 General Query Packets
=========================

Packets starting with 'q' are "general query packets"; packets starting
with 'Q' are "general set packets".  General query and set packets are a
semi-unified form for retrieving and sending information to and from the
stub.

   The initial letter of a query or set packet is followed by a name
indicating what sort of thing the packet applies to.  For example, GDB
may use a 'qSymbol' packet to exchange symbol definitions with the stub.
These packet names follow some conventions:

   * The name must not contain commas, colons or semicolons.
   * Most GDB query and set packets have a leading upper case letter.
   * The names of custom vendor packets should use a company prefix, in
     lower case, followed by a period.  For example, packets designed at
     the Acme Corporation might begin with 'qacme.foo' (for querying
     foos) or 'Qacme.bar' (for setting bars).

   The name of a query or set packet should be separated from any
parameters by a ':'; the parameters themselves should be separated by
',' or ';'.  Stubs must be careful to match the full packet name, and
check for a separator or the end of the packet, in case two packet names
share a common prefix.  New packets should not begin with 'qC', 'qP', or
'qL'(1).

   Like the descriptions of the other packets, each description here has
a template showing the packet's overall syntax, followed by an
explanation of the packet's meaning.  We include spaces in some of the
templates for clarity; these are not part of the packet's syntax.  No
GDB packet uses spaces to separate its components.

   Here are the currently defined query and set packets:

'QAgent:1'
'QAgent:0'
     Turn on or off the agent as a helper to perform some debugging
     operations delegated from GDB (*note Control Agent::).

'QAllow:OP:VAL...'
     Specify which operations GDB expects to request of the target, as a
     semicolon-separated list of operation name and value pairs.
     Possible values for OP include 'WriteReg', 'WriteMem',
     'InsertBreak', 'InsertTrace', 'InsertFastTrace', and 'Stop'.  VAL
     is either 0, indicating that GDB will not request the operation, or
     1, indicating that it may.  (The target can then use this to set up
     its own internals optimally, for instance if the debugger never
     expects to insert breakpoints, it may not need to install its own
     trap handler.)

'qC'
     Return the current thread ID.

     '(anything else)'
          Any other reply implies the old thread ID.

'qCRC:ADDR,LENGTH'
     Compute the CRC checksum of a block of memory using CRC-32 defined
     in IEEE 802.3.  The CRC is computed byte at a time, taking the most
     significant bit of each byte first.  The initial pattern code
     '0xffffffff' is used to ensure leading zeros affect the CRC.

     _Note:_ This is the same CRC used in validating separate debug
     files (*note Debugging Information in Separate Files: Separate
     Debug Files.).  However the algorithm is slightly different.  When
     validating separate debug files, the CRC is computed taking the
     _least_ significant bit of each byte first, and the final result is
     inverted to detect trailing zeros.

     'E NN'

     'C CRC32'
          The specified memory region's checksum is CRC32.

'QDisableRandomization:VALUE'
     Some target operating systems will randomize the virtual address
     space of the inferior process as a security feature, but provide a
     feature to disable such randomization, e.g. to allow for a more
     deterministic debugging experience.  On such systems, this packet
     with a VALUE of 1 directs the target to disable address space
     randomization for processes subsequently started via 'vRun'
     packets, while a packet with a VALUE of 0 tells the target to
     enable address space randomization.

     This packet is only available in extended mode (*note extended
     mode::).

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The request succeeded.

     'E NN'
          An error occurred.  The error number NN is given as hex
          digits.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'QDisableRandomization' is not
          supported by the stub.

     This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must request
     it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response (*note
     qSupported::).  This should only be done on targets that actually
     support disabling address space randomization.

'qfThreadInfo'
'qsThreadInfo'
     Obtain a list of all active thread IDs from the target (OS). Since
     there may be too many active threads to fit into one reply packet,
     this query works iteratively: it may require more than one
     query/reply sequence to obtain the entire list of threads.  The
     first query of the sequence will be the 'qfThreadInfo' query;
     subsequent queries in the sequence will be the 'qsThreadInfo'
     query.

     NOTE: This packet replaces the 'qL' query (see below).

     Reply:
     'm THREAD-ID'
          A single thread ID
     'm THREAD-ID,THREAD-ID...'
          a comma-separated list of thread IDs
     'l'
          (lower case letter 'L') denotes end of list.

     In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one
     or more thread IDs, separated by commas.  GDB will respond to each
     reply with a request for more thread ids (using the 'qs' form of
     the query), until the target responds with 'l' (lower-case ell, for
     "last").  Refer to *note thread-id syntax::, for the format of the
     THREAD-ID fields.

     _Note: GDB will send the 'qfThreadInfo' query during the initial
     connection with the remote target, and the very first thread ID
     mentioned in the reply will be stopped by GDB in a subsequent
     message.  Therefore, the stub should ensure that the first thread
     ID in the 'qfThreadInfo' reply is suitable for being stopped by
     GDB._

'qGetTLSAddr:THREAD-ID,OFFSET,LM'
     Fetch the address associated with thread local storage specified by
     THREAD-ID, OFFSET, and LM.

     THREAD-ID is the thread ID associated with the thread for which to
     fetch the TLS address.  *Note thread-id syntax::.

     OFFSET is the (big endian, hex encoded) offset associated with the
     thread local variable.  (This offset is obtained from the debug
     information associated with the variable.)

     LM is the (big endian, hex encoded) OS/ABI-specific encoding of the
     load module associated with the thread local storage.  For example,
     a GNU/Linux system will pass the link map address of the shared
     object associated with the thread local storage under
     consideration.  Other operating environments may choose to
     represent the load module differently, so the precise meaning of
     this parameter will vary.

'qL STARTFLAG THREADCOUNT NEXTTHREAD'
     Obtain thread information from RTOS. Where: STARTFLAG (one hex
     digit) is one to indicate the first query and zero to indicate a
     subsequent query; THREADCOUNT (two hex digits) is the maximum
     number of threads the response packet can contain; and NEXTTHREAD
     (eight hex digits), for subsequent queries (STARTFLAG is zero), is
     returned in the response as ARGTHREAD.

     above).

     Reply:
     'qM COUNT DONE ARGTHREAD THREAD...'
          Where: COUNT (two hex digits) is the number of threads being

          threads and one indicates no further threads; ARGTHREADID
          (eight hex digits) is NEXTTHREAD from the request packet;
          THREAD... is a sequence of thread IDs, THREADID (eight hex
          digits), from the target.  See

'qOffsets'
     Get section offsets that the target used when relocating the
     downloaded image.

     Reply:
     'Text=XXX;Data=YYY[;Bss=ZZZ]'
          Relocate the 'Text' section by XXX from its original address.
          Relocate the 'Data' section by YYY from its original address.
          If the object file format provides segment information (e.g.
          ELF 'PT_LOAD' program headers), GDB will relocate entire
          segments by the supplied offsets.

          _Note: while a 'Bss' offset may be included in the response,
          GDB ignores this and instead applies the 'Data' offset to the
          'Bss' section._

     'TextSeg=XXX[;DataSeg=YYY]'
          Relocate the first segment of the object file, which
          conventionally contains program code, to a starting address of
          XXX.  If 'DataSeg' is specified, relocate the second segment,
          which conventionally contains modifiable data, to a starting
          address of YYY.  GDB will report an error if the object file
          does not contain segment information, or does not contain at
          least as many segments as mentioned in the reply.  Extra
          segments are kept at fixed offsets relative to the last
          relocated segment.

'qP MODE THREAD-ID'
     Returns information on THREAD-ID.  Where: MODE is a hex encoded 32
     bit mode; THREAD-ID is a thread ID (*note thread-id syntax::).

'QPassSignals: SIGNAL [;SIGNAL]...'
     Each listed SIGNAL should be passed directly to the inferior

     stop replies (*note Stop Reply Packets::).  Each SIGNAL list item
     should be strictly greater than the previous item.  These signals
     do not need to stop the inferior, or be reported to GDB.  All other
     signals should be reported to GDB.  Multiple 'QPassSignals' packets
     do not combine; any earlier 'QPassSignals' list is completely
     replaced by the new list.  This packet improves performance when

'QProgramSignals: SIGNAL [;SIGNAL]...'
     Each listed SIGNAL may be delivered to the inferior process.
     Others should be silently discarded.

     In some cases, the remote stub may need to decide whether to
     deliver a signal to the program or not without GDB involvement.
     One example of that is while detaching -- the program's threads may
     have stopped for signals that haven't yet had a chance of being
     reported to GDB, and so the remote stub can use the signal list
     specified by this packet to know whether to deliver or ignore those
     pending signals.

     This does not influence whether to deliver a signal as requested by
     a resumption packet (*note vCont packet::).

     Signals are numbered identically to continue packets and stop

'qSupported [:GDBFEATURE [;GDBFEATURE]... ]'
     Tell the remote stub about features supported by GDB, and query the
     stub for features it supports.  This packet allows GDB and the
     remote stub to take advantage of each others' features.
     'qSupported' also consolidates multiple feature probes at startup,
     to improve GDB performance--a single larger packet performs better
     than multiple smaller probe packets on high-latency links.  Some
     features may enable behavior which must not be on by default, e.g.
     because it would confuse older clients or stubs.  Other features
     may describe packets which could be automatically probed for, but
     are not.  These features must be reported before GDB will use them.
     This "default unsupported" behavior is not appropriate for all
     packets, but it helps to keep the initial connection time under
     control with new versions of GDB which support increasing numbers
     of packets.

     Reply:
     'STUBFEATURE [;STUBFEATURE]...'
          The stub supports or does not support each returned
          STUBFEATURE, depending on the form of each STUBFEATURE (see
          below for the possible forms).
     ''
          An empty reply indicates that 'qSupported' is not recognized,
          or that no features needed to be reported to GDB.

     The allowed forms for each feature (either a GDBFEATURE in the
     'qSupported' packet, or a STUBFEATURE in the response) are:

     'NAME=VALUE'
          The remote protocol feature NAME is supported, and associated
          with the specified VALUE.  The format of VALUE depends on the
          feature, but it must not include a semicolon.
     'NAME+'
          The remote protocol feature NAME is supported, and does not
          need an associated value.
     'NAME-'
          The remote protocol feature NAME is not supported.
     'NAME?'
          The remote protocol feature NAME may be supported, and GDB
          should auto-detect support in some other way when it is
          needed.  This form will not be used for GDBFEATURE
          notifications, but may be used for STUBFEATURE responses.

     Whenever the stub receives a 'qSupported' request, the supplied set
     of GDB features should override any previous request.  This allows
     GDB to put the stub in a known state, even if the stub had
     previously been communicating with a different version of GDB.

     The following values of GDBFEATURE (for the packet sent by GDB) are
     defined:

     'multiprocess'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports multiprocess
          extensions to the remote protocol.  GDB does not use such
          extensions unless the stub also reports that it supports them
          by including 'multiprocess+' in its 'qSupported' reply.  *Note
          multiprocess extensions::, for details.

     'xmlRegisters'
          This feature indicates that GDB supports the XML target
          description.  If the stub sees 'xmlRegisters=' with target
          specific strings separated by a comma, it will report register
          description.

     'qRelocInsn'
          This feature indicates whether GDB supports the 'qRelocInsn'
          packet (*note Relocate instruction reply packet: Tracepoint
          Packets.).

     Stubs should ignore any unknown values for GDBFEATURE.  Any GDB
     which sends a 'qSupported' packet supports receiving packets of
     unlimited length (earlier versions of GDB may reject overly long
     responses).  Additional values for GDBFEATURE may be defined in the
     future to let the stub take advantage of new features in GDB, e.g.
     incompatible improvements in the remote protocol--the
     'multiprocess' feature is an example of such a feature.  The stub's
     reply should be independent of the GDBFEATURE entries sent by GDB;
     first GDB describes all the features it supports, and then the stub
     replies with all the features it supports.

     Similarly, GDB will silently ignore unrecognized stub feature
     responses, as long as each response uses one of the standard forms.

     Some features are flags.  A stub which supports a flag feature
     should respond with a '+' form response.  Other features require
     values, and the stub should respond with an '=' form response.

     Each feature has a default value, which GDB will use if
     'qSupported' is not available or if the feature is not mentioned in
     the 'qSupported' response.  The default values are fixed; a stub is
     free to omit any feature responses that match the defaults.

     Not all features can be probed, but for those which can, the
     probing mechanism is useful: in some cases, a stub's internal
     architecture may not allow the protocol layer to know some
     information about the underlying target in advance.  This is
     especially common in stubs which may be configured for multiple
     targets.

     These are the currently defined stub features and their properties:

     These are the currently defined stub features, in more detail:

     'PacketSize=BYTES'
          The remote stub can accept packets up to at least BYTES in
          length.  GDB will send packets up to this size for bulk
          transfers, and will never send larger packets.  This is a
          limit on the data characters in the packet, including the
          frame and checksum.  There is no trailing NUL byte in a remote
          protocol packet; if the stub stores packets in a
          NUL-terminated format, it should allow an extra byte in its
          buffer for the NUL. If this stub feature is not supported, GDB
          guesses based on the size of the 'g' packet response.

     'qXfer:auxv:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:auxv:read' packet
          (*note qXfer auxiliary vector read::).

     'qXfer:btrace:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:btrace:read' packet
          (*note qXfer btrace read::).

     'qXfer:features:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:features:read' packet
          (*note qXfer target description read::).

     'qXfer:libraries:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:libraries:read' packet
          (*note qXfer library list read::).

     'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read'
          packet (*note qXfer svr4 library list read::).

     'augmented-libraries-svr4-read'
          The remote stub understands the augmented form of the
          'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read' packet (*note qXfer svr4 library
          list read::).

     'qXfer:memory-map:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:memory-map:read' packet
          (*note qXfer memory map read::).

     'qXfer:sdata:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:sdata:read' packet
          (*note qXfer sdata read::).

     'qXfer:spu:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:spu:read' packet (*note
          qXfer spu read::).

     'qXfer:spu:write'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:spu:write' packet
          (*note qXfer spu write::).

     'qXfer:siginfo:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:siginfo:read' packet
          (*note qXfer siginfo read::).

     'qXfer:siginfo:write'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:siginfo:write' packet
          (*note qXfer siginfo write::).

     'qXfer:threads:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:threads:read' packet
          (*note qXfer threads read::).

     'qXfer:traceframe-info:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:traceframe-info:read'
          packet (*note qXfer traceframe info read::).

     'qXfer:uib:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:uib:read' packet (*note
          qXfer unwind info block::).

     'qXfer:fdpic:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:fdpic:read' packet
          (*note qXfer fdpic loadmap read::).

     'QNonStop'
          The remote stub understands the 'QNonStop' packet (*note
          QNonStop::).

     'QPassSignals'
          The remote stub understands the 'QPassSignals' packet (*note
          QPassSignals::).

     'QStartNoAckMode'
          The remote stub understands the 'QStartNoAckMode' packet and
          prefers to operate in no-acknowledgment mode.  *Note Packet
          Acknowledgment::.

     'multiprocess'
          The remote stub understands the multiprocess extensions to the
          remote protocol syntax.  The multiprocess extensions affect
          the syntax of thread IDs in both packets and replies (*note
          thread-id syntax::), and add process IDs to the 'D' packet and
          'W' and 'X' replies.  Note that reporting this feature
          indicates support for the syntactic extensions only, not that
          the stub necessarily supports debugging of more than one
          process at a time.  The stub must not use multiprocess
          extensions in packet replies unless GDB has also indicated it
          supports them in its 'qSupported' request.

     'qXfer:osdata:read'
          The remote stub understands the 'qXfer:osdata:read' packet
          ((*note qXfer osdata read::).

     'ConditionalBreakpoints'
          The target accepts and implements evaluation of conditional
          expressions defined for breakpoints.  The target will only
          report breakpoint triggers when such conditions are true
          (*note Break Conditions: Conditions.).

     'ConditionalTracepoints'
          The remote stub accepts and implements conditional expressions
          defined for tracepoints (*note Tracepoint Conditions::).

     'ReverseContinue'
          The remote stub accepts and implements the reverse continue
          packet (*note bc::).

     'ReverseStep'
          The remote stub accepts and implements the reverse step packet
          (*note bs::).

     'TracepointSource'
          The remote stub understands the 'QTDPsrc' packet that supplies
          the source form of tracepoint definitions.

     'QAgent'
          The remote stub understands the 'QAgent' packet.

     'QAllow'
          The remote stub understands the 'QAllow' packet.

     'QDisableRandomization'
          The remote stub understands the 'QDisableRandomization'
          packet.

     'StaticTracepoint'
          The remote stub supports static tracepoints.

     'InstallInTrace'
          The remote stub supports installing tracepoint in tracing.

     'EnableDisableTracepoints'
          The remote stub supports the 'QTEnable' (*note QTEnable::) and
          'QTDisable' (*note QTDisable::) packets that allow tracepoints
          to be enabled and disabled while a trace experiment is
          running.

     'QTBuffer:size'
          The remote stub supports the 'QTBuffer:size' (*note
          QTBuffer-size::) packet that allows to change the size of the
          trace buffer.

     'tracenz'
          The remote stub supports the 'tracenz' bytecode for collecting
          strings.  See *note Bytecode Descriptions:: for details about
          the bytecode.

     'BreakpointCommands'
          The remote stub supports running a breakpoint's command list
          itself, rather than reporting the hit to GDB.

     'Qbtrace:off'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace:off' packet.

     'Qbtrace:bts'
          The remote stub understands the 'Qbtrace:bts' packet.

'qSymbol::'
     Notify the target that GDB is prepared to serve symbol lookup
     requests.  Accept requests from the target for the values of
     symbols.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The target does not need to look up any (more) symbols.
     'qSymbol:SYM_NAME'
          The target requests the value of symbol SYM_NAME (hex
          encoded).  GDB may provide the value by using the
          'qSymbol:SYM_VALUE:SYM_NAME' message, described below.

'qSymbol:SYM_VALUE:SYM_NAME'
     Set the value of SYM_NAME to SYM_VALUE.

     SYM_NAME (hex encoded) is the name of a symbol whose value the
     target has previously requested.

     SYM_VALUE (hex) is the value for symbol SYM_NAME.  If GDB cannot
     supply a value for SYM_NAME, then this field will be empty.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          The target does not need to look up any (more) symbols.
     'qSymbol:SYM_NAME'
          The target requests the value of a new symbol SYM_NAME (hex
          encoded).  GDB will continue to supply the values of symbols
          (if available), until the target ceases to request them.

'qTBuffer'
'QTBuffer'
'QTDisconnected'
'QTDP'
'QTDPsrc'
'QTDV'
'qTfP'
'qTfV'
'QTFrame'
'qTMinFTPILen'

     *Note Tracepoint Packets::.

'qThreadExtraInfo,THREAD-ID'
     Obtain from the target OS a printable string description of thread
     attributes for the thread THREAD-ID; see *note thread-id syntax::,
     for the forms of THREAD-ID.  This string may contain anything that
     the target OS thinks is interesting for GDB to tell the user about
     the thread.  The string is displayed in GDB's 'info threads'
     display.  Some examples of possible thread extra info strings are
     'Runnable', or 'Blocked on Mutex'.

     Reply:
     'XX...'
          Where 'XX...' is a hex encoding of ASCII data, comprising the
          printable string containing the extra information about the
          thread's attributes.

     (Note that the 'qThreadExtraInfo' packet's name is separated from
     the command by a ',', not a ':', contrary to the naming conventions
     above.  Please don't use this packet as a model for new packets.)

'qXfer:OBJECT:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
     Read uninterpreted bytes from the target's special data area
     identified by the keyword OBJECT.  Request LENGTH bytes starting at
     OFFSET bytes into the data.  The content and encoding of ANNEX is
     specific to OBJECT; it can supply additional details about what
     data to access.

     Here are the specific requests of this form defined so far.  All
     'qXfer:OBJECT:read:...' requests use the same reply formats, listed
     below.

     'qXfer:auxv:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's "auxiliary vector".  *Note auxiliary
          vector: OS Information.  Note ANNEX must be empty.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:btrace:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return a description of the current branch trace.  *Note
          Branch Trace Format::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer'
          packet may have one of the following values:

          'all'
               Returns all available branch trace.

          'new'
               Returns all available branch trace if the branch trace
               changed since the last read request.

          'delta'
               Returns the new branch trace since the last read request.
               Adds a new block to the end of the trace that begins at
               zero and ends at the source location of the first branch
               in the trace buffer.  This extra block is used to stitch
               traces together.

               If the trace buffer overflowed, returns an error
               indicating the overflow.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:features:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the "target description".  *Note Target Descriptions::.
          The annex specifies which XML document to access.  The main
          description is always loaded from the 'target.xml' annex.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:libraries:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's list of loaded libraries.  *Note Library
          List Format::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet
          must be empty (*note qXfer read::).

          Targets which maintain a list of libraries in the program's
          memory do not need to implement this packet; it is designed
          for platforms where the operating system manages the list of
          loaded libraries.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's list of loaded libraries when the target
          is an SVR4 platform.  *Note Library List Format for SVR4
          Targets::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must
          be empty unless the remote stub indicated it supports the
          augmented form of this packet by supplying an appropriate
          'qSupported' response (*note qXfer read::, *note
          qSupported::).

          This packet is optional for better performance on SVR4
          targets.  GDB uses memory read packets to read the SVR4
          library list otherwise.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

          If the remote stub indicates it supports the augmented form of
          this packet then the annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet
          may contain a semicolon-separated list of 'NAME=VALUE'
          arguments.  The currently supported arguments are:

          'start=ADDRESS'
               A hexadecimal number specifying the address of the
               'struct link_map' to start reading the library list from.
               If unset or zero then the first 'struct link_map' in the
               library list will be chosen as the starting point.

          'prev=ADDRESS'
               A hexadecimal number specifying the address of the
               'struct link_map' immediately preceding the 'struct
               link_map' specified by the 'start' argument.  If unset or
               zero then the remote stub will expect that no 'struct
               link_map' exists prior to the starting point.

          Arguments that are not understood by the remote stub will be
          silently ignored.

     'qXfer:memory-map:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's "memory-map".  *Note Memory Map Format::.
          The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must be empty
          (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:sdata:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Read contents of the extra collected static tracepoint marker
          information.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet
          must be empty (*note qXfer read::).  *Note Tracepoint Action
          Lists: Tracepoint Actions.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:siginfo:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Read contents of the extra signal information on the target
          system.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must be
          empty (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:spu:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Read contents of an 'spufs' file on the target system.  The
          annex specifies which file to read; it must be of the form
          'ID/NAME', where ID specifies an SPU context ID in the target
          process, and NAME identifes the 'spufs' file in that context
          to be accessed.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:threads:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the list of threads on target.  *Note Thread List
          Format::.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must
          be empty (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:traceframe-info:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return a description of the current traceframe's contents.
          *Note Traceframe Info Format::.  The annex part of the generic
          'qXfer' packet must be empty (*note qXfer read::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:uib:read:PC:OFFSET,LENGTH'

          Return the unwind information block for PC.  This packet is
          used on OpenVMS/ia64 to ask the kernel unwind information.

          This packet is not probed by default.

     'qXfer:fdpic:read:ANNEX:OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Read contents of 'loadmap's on the target system.  The annex,
          either 'exec' or 'interp', specifies which 'loadmap',
          executable 'loadmap' or interpreter 'loadmap' to read.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:osdata:read::OFFSET,LENGTH'
          Access the target's "operating system information".  *Note
          Operating System Information::.

     Reply:
     'm DATA'
          Data DATA (*note Binary Data::) has been read from the target.
          There may be more data at a higher address (although it is
          permitted to return 'm' even for the last valid block of data,
          as long as at least one byte of data was read).  It is
          possible for DATA to have fewer bytes than the LENGTH in the
          request.

     'l DATA'
          Data DATA (*note Binary Data::) has been read from the target.
          There is no more data to be read.  It is possible for DATA to
          have fewer bytes than the LENGTH in the request.

     'l'
          The OFFSET in the request is at the end of the data.  There is
          no more data to be read.

     'E00'
          The request was malformed, or ANNEX was invalid.

     'E NN'
          The offset was invalid, or there was an error encountered
          reading the data.  The NN part is a hex-encoded 'errno' value.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates the OBJECT string was not recognized
          by the stub, or that the object does not support reading.

'qXfer:OBJECT:write:ANNEX:OFFSET:DATA...'
     Write uninterpreted bytes into the target's special data area
     identified by the keyword OBJECT, starting at OFFSET bytes into the
     data.  The binary-encoded data (*note Binary Data::) to be written
     is given by DATA....  The content and encoding of ANNEX is specific
     to OBJECT; it can supply additional details about what data to
     access.

     Here are the specific requests of this form defined so far.  All
     'qXfer:OBJECT:write:...' requests use the same reply formats,
     listed below.

     'qXfer:siginfo:write::OFFSET:DATA...'
          Write DATA to the extra signal information on the target
          system.  The annex part of the generic 'qXfer' packet must be
          empty (*note qXfer write::).

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     'qXfer:spu:write:ANNEX:OFFSET:DATA...'
          Write DATA to an 'spufs' file on the target system.  The annex
          specifies which file to write; it must be of the form
          'ID/NAME', where ID specifies an SPU context ID in the target
          process, and NAME identifes the 'spufs' file in that context
          to be accessed.

          This packet is not probed by default; the remote stub must
          request it, by supplying an appropriate 'qSupported' response
          (*note qSupported::).

     Reply:
     'NN'
          NN (hex encoded) is the number of bytes written.  This may be
          fewer bytes than supplied in the request.

     'E00'
          The request was malformed, or ANNEX was invalid.

     'E NN'
          The offset was invalid, or there was an error encountered
          writing the data.  The NN part is a hex-encoded 'errno' value.

     ''
          An empty reply indicates the OBJECT string was not recognized
          by the stub, or that the object does not support writing.

'qXfer:OBJECT:OPERATION:...'
     Requests of this form may be added in the future.  When a stub does
     not recognize the OBJECT keyword, or its support for OBJECT does
     not recognize the OPERATION keyword, the stub must respond with an
     empty packet.

'qAttached:PID'
     Return an indication of whether the remote server attached to an
     existing process or created a new process.  When the multiprocess
     protocol extensions are supported (*note multiprocess
     extensions::), PID is an integer in hexadecimal format identifying
     the target process.  Otherwise, GDB will omit the PID field and the
     query packet will be simplified as 'qAttached'.

     This query is used, for example, to know whether the remote process
     should be detached or killed when a GDB session is ended with the
     'quit' command.

     Reply:
     '1'
          The remote server attached to an existing process.
     '0'
          The remote server created a new process.
     'E NN'
          A badly formed request or an error was encountered.

'Qbtrace:bts'
     Enable branch tracing for the current thread using bts tracing.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          Branch tracing has been enabled.
     'E.errtext'
          A badly formed request or an error was encountered.

'Qbtrace:off'
     Disable branch tracing for the current thread.

     Reply:
     'OK'
          Branch tracing has been disabled.
     'E.errtext'
          A badly formed request or an error was encountered.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The 'qP' and 'qL' packets predate these conventions, and have
arguments without any terminator for the packet name; we suspect they
are in widespread use in places that are difficult to upgrade.  The 'qC'
packet has no arguments, but some existing stubs (e.g. RedBoot) are
known to not check for the end of the packet.

...................................

The following 'g'/'G' packets have previously been defined.  In the
below, some thirty-two bit registers are transferred as sixty-four bits.
Those registers should be zero/sign extended (which?)  to fill the space
allocated.  Register bytes are transferred in target byte order.  The
two nibbles within a register byte are transferred most-significant -
least-significant.

MIPS32
     All registers are transferred as thirty-two bit quantities in the
     order: 32 general-purpose; sr; lo; hi; bad; cause; pc; 32
     floating-point registers; fsr; fir; fp.

MIPS64
     All registers are transferred as sixty-four bit quantities
     (including thirty-two bit registers such as 'sr').  The ordering is
     the same as 'MIPS32'.

E.6 Tracepoint Packets
======================

Here we describe the packets GDB uses to implement tracepoints (*note
Tracepoints::).

'QTDP:N:ADDR:ENA:STEP:PASS[:FFLEN][:XLEN,BYTES][-]'
     Create a new tracepoint, number N, at ADDR.  If ENA is 'E', then
     the tracepoint is enabled; if it is 'D', then the tracepoint is
     disabled.  The STEP gives the tracepoint's step count, and PASS
     gives its pass count.  If an 'F' is present, then the tracepoint is
     to be a fast tracepoint, and the FLEN is the number of bytes that
     the target should copy elsewhere to make room for the tracepoint.
     If an 'X' is present, it introduces a tracepoint condition, which
     consists of a hexadecimal length, followed by a comma and
     hex-encoded bytes, in a manner similar to action encodings as
     described below.  If the trailing '-' is present, further 'QTDP'
     packets will follow to specify this tracepoint's actions.

     Replies:
     'OK'
          The packet was understood and carried out.
     'qRelocInsn'
          *Note Relocate instruction reply packet: Tracepoint Packets.
     ''
          The packet was not recognized.

'QTDP:-N:ADDR:[S]ACTION...[-]'
     Define actions to be taken when a tracepoint is hit.  The N and
     ADDR must be the same as in the initial 'QTDP' packet for this
     tracepoint.  This packet may only be sent immediately after another
     'QTDP' packet that ended with a '-'.  If the trailing '-' is
     present, further 'QTDP' packets will follow, specifying more
     actions for this tracepoint.

     In the series of action packets for a given tracepoint, at most one
     can have an 'S' before its first ACTION.  If such a packet is sent,
     it and the following packets define "while-stepping" actions.  Any
     prior packets define ordinary actions -- that is, those taken when
     the tracepoint is first hit.  If no action packet has an 'S', then
     all the packets in the series specify ordinary tracepoint actions.

     The 'ACTION...' portion of the packet is a series of actions,
     concatenated without separators.  Each action has one of the
     following forms:

     'R MASK'
          Collect the registers whose bits are set in MASK, a
          hexadecimal number whose I'th bit is set if register number I
          should be collected.  (The least significant bit is numbered
          zero.)  Note that MASK may be any number of digits long; it
          may not fit in a 32-bit word.

     'M BASEREG,OFFSET,LEN'
          Collect LEN bytes of memory starting at the address in
          register number BASEREG, plus OFFSET.  If BASEREG is '-1',
          then the range has a fixed address: OFFSET is the address of
          the lowest byte to collect.  The BASEREG, OFFSET, and LEN
          parameters are all unsigned hexadecimal values (the '-1' value
          for BASEREG is a special case).

     'X LEN,EXPR'
          Evaluate EXPR, whose length is LEN, and collect memory as it
          directs.  The agent expression EXPR is as described in *note
          Agent Expressions::.  Each byte of the expression is encoded
          as a two-digit hex number in the packet; LEN is the number of
          bytes in the expression (and thus one-half the number of hex
          digits in the packet).

     Any number of actions may be packed together in a single 'QTDP'
     packet, as long as the packet does not exceed the maximum packet
     length (400 bytes, for many stubs).  There may be only one 'R'
     action per tracepoint, and it must precede any 'M' or 'X' actions.
     Any registers referred to by 'M' and 'X' actions must be collected
     by a preceding 'R' action.  (The "while-stepping" actions are
     treated as if they were attached to a separate tracepoint, as far
     as these restrictions are concerned.)

     Replies:
     'OK'
          The packet was understood and carried out.
     'qRelocInsn'
          *Note Relocate instruction reply packet: Tracepoint Packets.
     ''
          The packet was not recognized.

'QTDPsrc:N:ADDR:TYPE:START:SLEN:BYTES'
     Specify a source string of tracepoint N at address ADDR.  This is
     useful to get accurate reproduction of the tracepoints originally
     downloaded at the beginning of the trace run.  The TYPE is the name
     of the tracepoint part, such as 'cond' for the tracepoint's
     conditional expression (see below for a list of types), while BYTES
     is the string, encoded in hexadecimal.

     START is the offset of the BYTES within the overall source string,
     while SLEN is the total length of the source string.  This is
     intended for handling source strings that are longer than will fit
     in a single packet.

     The available string types are 'at' for the location, 'cond' for
     the conditional, and 'cmd' for an action command.  GDB sends a
     separate packet for each command in the action list, in the same
     order in which the commands are stored in the list.

     The target does not need to do anything with source strings except
     report them back as part of the replies to the 'qTfP'/'qTsP' query
     packets.

     Although this packet is optional, and GDB will only send it if the
     target replies with 'TracepointSource' *Note General Query
     Packets::, it makes both disconnected tracing and trace files much
     easier to use.  Otherwise the user must be careful that the
     tracepoints in effect while looking at trace frames are identical
     to the ones in effect during the trace run; even a small
     discrepancy could cause 'tdump' not to work, or a particular trace
     frame not be found.

'QTDV:N:VALUE'
     Create a new trace state variable, number N, with an initial value
     of VALUE, which is a 64-bit signed integer.  Both N and VALUE are
     encoded as hexadecimal values.  GDB has the option of not using
     this packet for initial values of zero; the target should simply
     create the trace state variables as they are mentioned in
     expressions.

'QTFrame:N'
     Select the N'th tracepoint frame from the buffer, and use the
     register and memory contents recorded there to answer subsequent
     request packets from GDB.

     A successful reply from the stub indicates that the stub has found
     the requested frame.  The response is a series of parts,
     concatenated without separators, describing the frame we selected.
     Each part has one of the following forms:

     'F F'
          The selected frame is number N in the trace frame buffer; F is
          a hexadecimal number.  If F is '-1', then there was no frame
          matching the criteria in the request packet.

     'T T'
          The selected trace frame records a hit of tracepoint number T;
          T is a hexadecimal number.

'QTFrame:pc:ADDR'
     Like 'QTFrame:N', but select the first tracepoint frame after the
     currently selected frame whose PC is ADDR; ADDR is a hexadecimal
     number.

'QTFrame:tdp:T'
     Like 'QTFrame:N', but select the first tracepoint frame after the
     currently selected frame that is a hit of tracepoint T; T is a
     hexadecimal number.

'QTFrame:range:START:END'
     Like 'QTFrame:N', but select the first tracepoint frame after the
     currently selected frame whose PC is between START (inclusive) and
     END (inclusive); START and END are hexadecimal numbers.

'QTFrame:outside:START:END'
     Like 'QTFrame:range:START:END', but select the first frame
     _outside_ the given range of addresses (exclusive).

'qTMinFTPILen'
     This packet requests the minimum length of instruction at which a
     fast tracepoint (*note Set Tracepoints::) may be placed.  For
     instance, on the 32-bit x86 architecture, it is possible to use a
     4-byte jump, but it depends on the target system being able to
     create trampolines in the first 64K of memory, which might or might
     not be possible for that system.  So the reply to this packet will
     be 4 if it is able to arrange for that.

     Replies:

     '0'
          The minimum instruction length is currently unknown.
     'LENGTH'
          The minimum instruction length is LENGTH, where LENGTH is a
          hexadecimal number greater or equal to 1.  A reply of 1 means
          that a fast tracepoint may be placed on any instruction
          regardless of size.
     'E'
          An error has occurred.
     ''
          An empty reply indicates that the request is not supported by
          the stub.

'QTStart'
     Begin the tracepoint experiment.  Begin collecting data from
     tracepoint hits in the trace frame buffer.  This packet supports
     the 'qRelocInsn' reply (*note Relocate instruction reply packet:
     Tracepoint Packets.).

'QTStop'
     End the tracepoint experiment.  Stop collecting trace frames.

'QTEnable:N:ADDR'
     Enable tracepoint N at address ADDR in a started tracepoint
     experiment.  If the tracepoint was previously disabled, then
     collection of data from it will resume.

'QTDisable:N:ADDR'
     Disable tracepoint N at address ADDR in a started tracepoint
     experiment.  No more data will be collected from the tracepoint
     unless 'QTEnable:N:ADDR' is subsequently issued.

'QTinit'
     Clear the table of tracepoints, and empty the trace frame buffer.

'QTro:START1,END1:START2,END2:...'
     Establish the given ranges of memory as "transparent".  The stub
     will answer requests for these ranges from memory's current
     contents, if they were not collected as part of the tracepoint hit.

     GDB uses this to mark read-only regions of memory, like those
     containing program code.  Since these areas never change, they
     should still have the same contents they did when the tracepoint
     was hit, so there's no reason for the stub to refuse to provide
     their contents.

'QTDisconnected:VALUE'
     Set the choice to what to do with the tracing run when GDB
     disconnects from the target.  A VALUE of 1 directs the target to
     continue the tracing run, while 0 tells the target to stop tracing
     if GDB is no longer in the picture.

'qTStatus'
     Ask the stub if there is a trace experiment running right now.

     The reply has the form:

     'TRUNNING[;FIELD]...'
          RUNNING is a single digit '1' if the trace is presently
          running, or '0' if not.  It is followed by semicolon-separated
          optional fields that an agent may use to report additional
          status.

     If the trace is not running, the agent may report any of several
     explanations as one of the optional fields:

     'tnotrun:0'
          No trace has been run yet.

     'tstop[:TEXT]:0'
          The trace was stopped by a user-originated stop command.  The
          optional TEXT field is a user-supplied string supplied as part
          of the stop command (for instance, an explanation of why the
          trace was stopped manually).  It is hex-encoded.

     'tfull:0'
          The trace stopped because the trace buffer filled up.

     'tdisconnected:0'
          The trace stopped because GDB disconnected from the target.

     'tpasscount:TPNUM'
          The trace stopped because tracepoint TPNUM exceeded its pass
          count.

     'terror:TEXT:TPNUM'
          The trace stopped because tracepoint TPNUM had an error.  The
          string TEXT is available to describe the nature of the error
          (for instance, a divide by zero in the condition expression);
          it is hex encoded.

     'tunknown:0'
          The trace stopped for some other reason.

     Additional optional fields supply statistical and other
     information.  Although not required, they are extremely useful for
     users monitoring the progress of a trace run.  If a trace has
     stopped, and these numbers are reported, they must reflect the
     state of the just-stopped trace.

     'tframes:N'
          The number of trace frames in the buffer.

     'tcreated:N'
          The total number of trace frames created during the run.  This
          may be larger than the trace frame count, if the buffer is
          circular.

     'tsize:N'
          The total size of the trace buffer, in bytes.

     'tfree:N'
          The number of bytes still unused in the buffer.

     'circular:N'
          The value of the circular trace buffer flag.  '1' means that
          the trace buffer is circular and old trace frames will be
          discarded if necessary to make room, '0' means that the trace
          buffer is linear and may fill up.

     'disconn:N'
          The value of the disconnected tracing flag.  '1' means that
          tracing will continue after GDB disconnects, '0' means that
          the trace run will stop.

'qTP:TP:ADDR'
     Ask the stub for the current state of tracepoint number TP at
     address ADDR.

     Replies:
     'VHITS:USAGE'
          The tracepoint has been hit HITS times so far during the trace
          run, and accounts for USAGE in the trace buffer.  Note that
          'while-stepping' steps are not counted as separate hits, but
          the steps' space consumption is added into the usage number.

'qTV:VAR'
     Ask the stub for the value of the trace state variable number VAR.

     Replies:
     'VVALUE'
          The value of the variable is VALUE.  This will be the current
          value of the variable if the user is examining a running
          target, or a saved value if the variable was collected in the
          trace frame that the user is looking at.  Note that multiple
          requests may result in different reply values, such as when
          requesting values while the program is running.

     'U'
          The value of the variable is unknown.  This would occur, for
          example, if the user is examining a trace frame in which the
          requested variable was not collected.

'qTfP'
'qTsP'
     These packets request data about tracepoints that are being used by
     the target.  GDB sends 'qTfP' to get the first piece of data, and
     multiple 'qTsP' to get additional pieces.  Replies to these packets
     generally take the form of the 'QTDP' packets that define
     tracepoints.  (FIXME add detailed syntax)

'qTfV'
'qTsV'
     These packets request data about trace state variables that are on
     the target.  GDB sends 'qTfV' to get the first vari of data, and
     multiple 'qTsV' to get additional variables.  Replies to these
     packets follow the syntax of the 'QTDV' packets that define trace
     state variables.

'qTfSTM'
'qTsSTM'
     These packets request data about static tracepoint markers that
     exist in the target program.  GDB sends 'qTfSTM' to get the first
     piece of data, and multiple 'qTsSTM' to get additional pieces.
     Replies to these packets take the following form:

     Reply:
     'm ADDRESS:ID:EXTRA'
          A single marker
     'm ADDRESS:ID:EXTRA,ADDRESS:ID:EXTRA...'
          a comma-separated list of markers
     'l'
          (lower case letter 'L') denotes end of list.
     'E NN'
          An error occurred.  The error number NN is given as hex
          digits.
     ''
          An empty reply indicates that the request is not supported by
          the stub.

     The ADDRESS is encoded in hex; ID and EXTRA are strings encoded in
     hex.

     In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one
     or more markers, separated by commas.  GDB will respond to each
     reply with a request for more markers (using the 'qs' form of the
     query), until the target responds with 'l' (lower-case ell, for
     "last").

'qTSTMat:ADDRESS'
     This packets requests data about static tracepoint markers in the
     target program at ADDRESS.  Replies to this packet follow the
     syntax of the 'qTfSTM' and 'qTsSTM' packets that list static
     tracepoint markers.

'QTSave:FILENAME'
     This packet directs the target to save trace data to the file name
     FILENAME in the target's filesystem.  The FILENAME is encoded as a
     hex string; the interpretation of the file name (relative vs
     absolute, wild cards, etc) is up to the target.

'qTBuffer:OFFSET,LEN'
     Return up to LEN bytes of the current contents of trace buffer,
     starting at OFFSET.  The trace buffer is treated as if it were a
     contiguous collection of traceframes, as per the trace file format.
     The reply consists as many hex-encoded bytes as the target can
     deliver in a packet; it is not an error to return fewer than were
     asked for.  A reply consisting of just 'l' indicates that no bytes
     are available.

'QTBuffer:circular:VALUE'
     This packet directs the target to use a circular trace buffer if
     VALUE is 1, or a linear buffer if the value is 0.

'QTBuffer:size:SIZE'
     This packet directs the target to make the trace buffer be of size
     SIZE if possible.  A value of '-1' tells the target to use whatever
     size it prefers.

'QTNotes:[TYPE:TEXT][;TYPE:TEXT]...'
     This packet adds optional textual notes to the trace run.
     Allowable types include 'user', 'notes', and 'tstop', the TEXT
     fields are arbitrary strings, hex-encoded.

E.6.1 Relocate instruction reply packet
---------------------------------------

When installing fast tracepoints in memory, the target may need to
relocate the instruction currently at the tracepoint address to a
different address in memory.  For most instructions, a simple copy is
enough, but, for example, call instructions that implicitly push the
return address on the stack, and relative branches or other PC-relative
instructions require offset adjustment, so that the effect of executing
the instruction at a different address is the same as if it had executed
in the original location.

   In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may also
respond with a number of intermediate 'qRelocInsn' request packets
before the final result packet, to have GDB handle this relocation
operation.  If a packet supports this mechanism, its documentation will
explicitly say so.  See for example the above descriptions for the
'QTStart' and 'QTDP' packets.  The format of the request is:

'qRelocInsn:FROM;TO'

     This requests GDB to copy instruction at address FROM to address
     TO, possibly adjusted so that executing the instruction at TO has
     the same effect as executing it at FROM.  GDB writes the adjusted
     instruction to target memory starting at TO.

   Replies:
'qRelocInsn:ADJUSTED_SIZE'
     Informs the stub the relocation is complete.  The ADJUSTED_SIZE is
     the length in bytes of resulting relocated instruction sequence.
'E NN'
     A badly formed request was detected, or an error was encountered
     while relocating the instruction.

E.7 Host I/O Packets
====================

The "Host I/O" packets allow GDB to perform I/O operations on the far
side of a remote link.  For example, Host I/O is used to upload and
download files to a remote target with its own filesystem.  Host I/O
uses the same constant values and data structure layout as the
target-initiated File-I/O protocol.  However, the Host I/O packets are
structured differently.  The target-initiated protocol relies on target
memory to store parameters and buffers.  Host I/O requests are initiated
by GDB, and the target's memory is not involved.  *Note File-I/O Remote
Protocol Extension::, for more details on the target-initiated protocol.

   The Host I/O request packets all encode a single operation along with
its arguments.  They have this format:

'vFile:OPERATION: PARAMETER...'
     OPERATION is the name of the particular request; the target should
     compare the entire packet name up to the second colon when checking
     for a supported operation.  The format of PARAMETER depends on the
     operation.  Numbers are always passed in hexadecimal.  Negative
     numbers have an explicit minus sign (i.e. two's complement is not
     used).  Strings (e.g. filenames) are encoded as a series of
     hexadecimal bytes.  The last argument to a system call may be a
     buffer of escaped binary data (*note Binary Data::).

   The valid responses to Host I/O packets are:

'F RESULT [, ERRNO] [; ATTACHMENT]'
     RESULT is the integer value returned by this operation, usually
     non-negative for success and -1 for errors.  If an error has
     occured, ERRNO will be included in the result specifying a value
     defined by the File-I/O protocol (*note Errno Values::).  For
     operations which return data, ATTACHMENT supplies the data as a
     binary buffer.  Binary buffers in response packets are escaped in
     the normal way (*note Binary Data::).  See the individual packet
     documentation for the interpretation of RESULT and ATTACHMENT.

''
     An empty response indicates that this operation is not recognized.

   These are the supported Host I/O operations:

'vFile:open: FILENAME, FLAGS, MODE'
     Open a file at FILENAME and return a file descriptor for it, or
     return -1 if an error occurs.  The FILENAME is a string, FLAGS is
     an integer indicating a mask of open flags (*note Open Flags::),
     and MODE is an integer indicating a mask of mode bits to use if the
     file is created (*note mode_t Values::).  *Note open::, for details
     of the open flags and mode values.

'vFile:close: FD'
     Close the open file corresponding to FD and return 0, or -1 if an
     error occurs.

'vFile:pread: FD, COUNT, OFFSET'
     Read data from the open file corresponding to FD.  Up to COUNT
     bytes will be read from the file, starting at OFFSET relative to
     the start of the file.  The target may read fewer bytes; common
     reasons include packet size limits and an end-of-file condition.
     The number of bytes read is returned.  Zero should only be returned
     for a successful read at the end of the file, or if COUNT was zero.

     The data read should be returned as a binary attachment on success.
     If zero bytes were read, the response should include an empty
     binary attachment (i.e. a trailing semicolon).  The return value is
     the number of target bytes read; the binary attachment may be
     longer if some characters were escaped.

'vFile:pwrite: FD, OFFSET, DATA'
     Write DATA (a binary buffer) to the open file corresponding to FD.
     Start the write at OFFSET from the start of the file.  Unlike many
     'write' system calls, there is no separate COUNT argument; the
     length of DATA in the packet is used.  'vFile:write' returns the
     number of bytes written, which may be shorter than the length of
     DATA, or -1 if an error occurred.

'vFile:unlink: FILENAME'
     Delete the file at FILENAME on the target.  Return 0, or -1 if an
     error occurs.  The FILENAME is a string.

'vFile:readlink: FILENAME'
     Read value of symbolic link FILENAME on the target.  Return the
     number of bytes read, or -1 if an error occurs.

     The data read should be returned as a binary attachment on success.
     If zero bytes were read, the response should include an empty
     binary attachment (i.e. a trailing semicolon).  The return value is
     the number of target bytes read; the binary attachment may be
     longer if some characters were escaped.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Interrupts,  Next: Notification Packets,  Prev: Host I/O Packets,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.8 Interrupts
==============

When a program on the remote target is running, GDB may attempt to
interrupt it by sending a 'Ctrl-C', 'BREAK' or a 'BREAK' followed by
'g', control of which is specified via GDB's 'interrupt-sequence'.

   The precise meaning of 'BREAK' is defined by the transport mechanism
and may, in fact, be undefined.  GDB does not currently define a 'BREAK'
mechanism for any of the network interfaces except for TCP, in which
case GDB sends the 'telnet' BREAK sequence.

   'Ctrl-C', on the other hand, is defined and implemented for all
transport mechanisms.  It is represented by sending the single byte
'0x03' without any of the usual packet overhead described in the
Overview section (*note Overview::).  When a '0x03' byte is transmitted
as part of a packet, it is considered to be packet data and does _not_
represent an interrupt.  E.g., an 'X' packet (*note X packet::), used
for binary downloads, may include an unescaped '0x03' as part of its
packet.

   'BREAK' followed by 'g' is also known as Magic SysRq g.  When Linux
kernel receives this sequence from serial port, it stops execution and
connects to gdb.

   Stubs are not required to recognize these interrupt mechanisms and
the precise meaning associated with receipt of the interrupt is
implementation defined.  If the target supports debugging of multiple
threads and/or processes, it should attempt to interrupt all
currently-executing threads and processes.  If the stub is successful at
interrupting the running program, it should send one of the stop reply
packets (*note Stop Reply Packets::) to GDB as a result of successfully
stopping the program in all-stop mode, and a stop reply for each stopped
thread in non-stop mode.  Interrupts received while the program is
stopped are discarded.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Notification Packets,  Next: Remote Non-Stop,  Prev: Interrupts,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.9 Notification Packets
========================

The GDB remote serial protocol includes "notifications", packets that
require no acknowledgment.  Both the GDB and the stub may send
notifications (although the only notifications defined at present are
sent by the stub).  Notifications carry information without incurring
the round-trip latency of an acknowledgment, and so are useful for
low-impact communications where occasional packet loss is not a problem.

   A notification packet has the form '% DATA # CHECKSUM', where DATA is
the content of the notification, and CHECKSUM is a checksum of DATA,
computed and formatted as for ordinary GDB packets.  A notification's
DATA never contains '$', '%' or '#' characters.  Upon receiving a
notification, the recipient sends no '+' or '-' to acknowledge the
notification's receipt or to report its corruption.

   Every notification's DATA begins with a name, which contains no colon
characters, followed by a colon character.

   Recipients should silently ignore corrupted notifications and
notifications they do not understand.  Recipients should restart timeout
periods on receipt of a well-formed notification, whether or not they
understand it.

   Senders should only send the notifications described here when this
protocol description specifies that they are permitted.  In the future,
we may extend the protocol to permit existing notifications in new
contexts; this rule helps older senders avoid confusing newer
recipients.

   (Older versions of GDB ignore bytes received until they see the '$'
byte that begins an ordinary packet, so new stubs may transmit
notifications without fear of confusing older clients.  There are no
notifications defined for GDB to send at the moment, but we assume that
most older stubs would ignore them, as well.)

   Each notification is comprised of three parts:
'NAME:EVENT'
     The notification packet is sent by the side that initiates the
     exchange (currently, only the stub does that), with EVENT carrying
     the specific information about the notification, and NAME
     specifying the name of the notification.
'ACK'
     The acknowledge sent by the other side, usually GDB, to acknowledge
     the exchange and request the event.

   The purpose of an asynchronous notification mechanism is to report to
GDB that something interesting happened in the remote stub.

   The remote stub may send notification NAME:EVENT at any time, but GDB
acknowledges the notification when appropriate.  The notification event
is pending before GDB acknowledges.  Only one notification at a time may
be pending; if additional events occur before GDB has acknowledged the
previous notification, they must be queued by the stub for later
synchronous transmission in response to ACK packets from GDB.  Because
the notification mechanism is unreliable, the stub is permitted to
resend a notification if it believes GDB may not have received it.

   Specifically, notifications may appear when GDB is not otherwise
reading input from the stub, or when GDB is expecting to read a normal
synchronous response or a '+'/'-' acknowledgment to a packet it has
sent.  Notification packets are distinct from any other communication
from the stub so there is no ambiguity.

   After receiving a notification, GDB shall acknowledge it by sending a
ACK packet as a regular, synchronous request to the stub.  Such
acknowledgment is not required to happen immediately, as GDB is
permitted to send other, unrelated packets to the stub first, which the
stub should process normally.

   Upon receiving a ACK packet, if the stub has other queued events to
report to GDB, it shall respond by sending a normal EVENT.  GDB shall
then send another ACK packet to solicit further responses; again, it is
permitted to send other, unrelated packets as well which the stub should
process normally.

   If the stub receives a ACK packet and there are no additional EVENT
to report, the stub shall return an 'OK' response.  At this point, GDB
has finished processing a notification and the stub has completed
sending any queued events.  GDB won't accept any new notifications until
the final 'OK' is received .  If further notification events occur, the
stub shall send a new notification, GDB shall accept the notification,
and the process shall be repeated.

   The process of asynchronous notification can be illustrated by the
following example:
     <- %%Stop:T0505:98e7ffbf;04:4ce6ffbf;08:b1b6e54c;thread:p7526.7526;core:0;
     ...
     -> vStopped
     <- T0505:68f37db7;04:40f37db7;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7528;core:0;
     -> vStopped
     <- T0505:68e3fdb6;04:40e3fdb6;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7529;core:0;
     -> vStopped
     <- OK

   The following notifications are defined:

NotificationAck     Event                       Description
                                                
Stop      vStopped  REPLY.  The REPLY has the   Report an asynchronous
                    form of a stop reply, as    stop event in non-stop
                    described in *note Stop     mode.
                    Reply Packets::.  Refer     
                    to *note Remote
                    Non-Stop::, for
                    information on how these
                    notifications are
                    acknowledged by GDB.

E.10 Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode
==============================================

GDB's remote protocol supports non-stop debugging of multi-threaded
programs, as described in *note Non-Stop Mode::.  If the stub supports
non-stop mode, it should report that to GDB by including 'QNonStop+' in
its 'qSupported' response (*note qSupported::).

   GDB typically sends a 'QNonStop' packet only when establishing a new
connection with the stub.  Entering non-stop mode does not alter the
state of any currently-running threads, but targets must stop all
threads in any already-attached processes when entering all-stop mode.
GDB uses the '?' packet as necessary to probe the target state after a
mode change.

   In non-stop mode, when an attached process encounters an event that
would otherwise be reported with a stop reply, it uses the asynchronous
notification mechanism (*note Notification Packets::) to inform GDB.  In
contrast to all-stop mode, where all threads in all processes are
stopped when a stop reply is sent, in non-stop mode only the thread
reporting the stop event is stopped.  That is, when reporting a 'S' or
'T' response to indicate completion of a step operation, hitting a
breakpoint, or a fault, only the affected thread is stopped; any other
still-running threads continue to run.  When reporting a 'W' or 'X'
response, all running threads belonging to other attached processes
continue to run.

   In non-stop mode, the target shall respond to the '?' packet as
follows.  First, any incomplete stop reply notification/'vStopped'
sequence in progress is abandoned.  The target must begin a new sequence
reporting stop events for all stopped threads, whether or not it has
previously reported those events to GDB.  The first stop reply is sent
as a synchronous reply to the '?' packet, and subsequent stop replies
are sent as responses to 'vStopped' packets using the mechanism
described above.  The target must not send asynchronous stop reply
notifications until the sequence is complete.  If all threads are
running when the target receives the '?' packet, or if the target is not
attached to any process, it shall respond 'OK'.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Packet Acknowledgment,  Next: Examples,  Prev: Remote Non-Stop,  Up: Remote Protocol

E.11 Packet Acknowledgment
==========================

By default, when either the host or the target machine receives a
packet, the first response expected is an acknowledgment: either '+' (to
indicate the package was received correctly) or '-' (to request
retransmission).  This mechanism allows the GDB remote protocol to
operate over unreliable transport mechanisms, such as a serial line.

   In cases where the transport mechanism is itself reliable (such as a
pipe or TCP connection), the '+'/'-' acknowledgments are redundant.  It
may be desirable to disable them in that case to reduce communication
overhead, or for other reasons.  This can be accomplished by means of
the 'QStartNoAckMode' packet; *note QStartNoAckMode::.

   When in no-acknowledgment mode, neither the stub nor GDB shall send
or expect '+'/'-' protocol acknowledgments.  The packet and response
format still includes the normal checksum, as described in *note
Overview::, but the checksum may be ignored by the receiver.

   If the stub supports 'QStartNoAckMode' and prefers to operate in
no-acknowledgment mode, it should report that to GDB by including
'QStartNoAckMode+' in its response to 'qSupported'; *note qSupported::.
If GDB also supports 'QStartNoAckMode' and it has not been disabled via
the 'set remote noack-packet off' command (*note Remote
Configuration::), GDB may then send a 'QStartNoAckMode' packet to the
stub.  Only then may the stub actually turn off packet acknowledgments.
GDB sends a final '+' acknowledgment of the stub's 'OK' response, which
can be safely ignored by the stub.

   Note that 'set remote noack-packet' command only affects negotiation
between GDB and the stub when subsequent connections are made; it does
not affect the protocol acknowledgment state for any current connection.
Since '+'/'-' acknowledgments are enabled by default when a new
connection is established, there is also no protocol request to
re-enable the acknowledgments for the current connection, once disabled.

E.13.1 File-I/O Overview
------------------------

The "File I/O remote protocol extension" (short: File-I/O) allows the
target to use the host's file system and console I/O to perform various
system calls.  System calls on the target system are translated into a
remote protocol packet to the host system, which then performs the
needed actions and returns a response packet to the target system.  This
simulates file system operations even on targets that lack file systems.

   The protocol is defined to be independent of both the host and target
systems.  It uses its own internal representation of datatypes and
values.  Both GDB and the target's GDB stub are responsible for
translating the system-dependent value representations into the internal
protocol representations when data is transmitted.

   The communication is synchronous.  A system call is possible only
when GDB is waiting for a response from the 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's'
packets.  While GDB handles the request for a system call, the target is
stopped to allow deterministic access to the target's memory.  Therefore
File-I/O is not interruptible by target signals.  On the other hand, it
is possible to interrupt File-I/O by a user interrupt ('Ctrl-C') within
GDB.

   The target's request to perform a host system call does not finish
the latest 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's' action.  That means, after finishing the
system call, the target returns to continuing the previous activity
(continue, step).  No additional continue or step request from GDB is
required.

     (gdb) continue
       <- target requests 'system call X'
       target is stopped, GDB executes system call
       -> GDB returns result
       ... target continues, GDB returns to wait for the target
       <- target hits breakpoint and sends a Txx packet

   The protocol only supports I/O on the console and to regular files on
the host file system.  Character or block special devices, pipes, named
pipes, sockets or any other communication method on the host system are
not supported by this protocol.

   File I/O is not supported in non-stop mode.

E.13.2 Protocol Basics
----------------------

The File-I/O protocol uses the 'F' packet as the request as well as
reply packet.  Since a File-I/O system call can only occur when GDB is
waiting for a response from the continuing or stepping target, the
File-I/O request is a reply that GDB has to expect as a result of a
previous 'C', 'c', 'S' or 's' packet.  This 'F' packet contains all
information needed to allow GDB to call the appropriate host system
call:

   * A unique identifier for the requested system call.

   * All parameters to the system call.  Pointers are given as addresses
     in the target memory address space.  Pointers to strings are given
     as pointer/length pair.  Numerical values are given as they are.
     Numerical control flags are given in a protocol-specific
     representation.

   At this point, GDB has to perform the following actions.

   * If the parameters include pointer values to data needed as input to
     a system call, GDB requests this data from the target with a
     standard 'm' packet request.  This additional communication has to
     be expected by the target implementation and is handled as any
     other 'm' packet.

   * GDB translates all value from protocol representation to host
     representation as needed.  Datatypes are coerced into the host
     types.

   * GDB calls the system call.

   * It then coerces datatypes back to protocol representation.

   * If the system call is expected to return data in buffer space
     specified by pointer parameters to the call, the data is
     transmitted to the target using a 'M' or 'X' packet.  This packet
     has to be expected by the target implementation and is handled as
     any other 'M' or 'X' packet.

   Eventually GDB replies with another 'F' packet which contains all
necessary information for the target to continue.  This at least
contains

   * Return value.

   * 'errno', if has been changed by the system call.

   * "Ctrl-C" flag.

   After having done the needed type and value coercion, the target
continues the latest continue or step action.

E.13.3 The 'F' Request Packet
-----------------------------

The 'F' request packet has the following format:

'FCALL-ID,PARAMETER...'

     CALL-ID is the identifier to indicate the host system call to be
     called.  This is just the name of the function.

     PARAMETER... are the parameters to the system call.  Parameters are
     hexadecimal integer values, either the actual values in case of
     scalar datatypes, pointers to target buffer space in case of
     compound datatypes and unspecified memory areas, or pointer/length
     pairs in case of string parameters.  These are appended to the
     CALL-ID as a comma-delimited list.  All values are transmitted in
     ASCII string representation, pointer/length pairs separated by a
     slash.

E.13.4 The 'F' Reply Packet
---------------------------

The 'F' reply packet has the following format:

'FRETCODE,ERRNO,CTRL-C FLAG;CALL-SPECIFIC ATTACHMENT'

     RETCODE is the return code of the system call as hexadecimal value.

     ERRNO is the 'errno' set by the call, in protocol-specific
     representation.  This parameter can be omitted if the call was
     successful.

     CTRL-C FLAG is only sent if the user requested a break.  In this
     case, ERRNO must be sent as well, even if the call was successful.
     The CTRL-C FLAG itself consists of the character 'C':

          F0,0,C

     or, if the call was interrupted before the host call has been
     performed:

          F-1,4,C

     assuming 4 is the protocol-specific representation of 'EINTR'.

E.13.5 The 'Ctrl-C' Message
---------------------------

If the 'Ctrl-C' flag is set in the GDB reply packet (*note The F Reply
Packet::), the target should behave as if it had gotten a break message.
The meaning for the target is "system call interrupted by 'SIGINT'".
Consequentially, the target should actually stop (as with a break
message) and return to GDB with a 'T02' packet.

   It's important for the target to know in which state the system call
was interrupted.  There are two possible cases:

   * The system call hasn't been performed on the host yet.

   * The system call on the host has been finished.

   These two states can be distinguished by the target by the value of
the returned 'errno'.  If it's the protocol representation of 'EINTR',
the system call hasn't been performed.  This is equivalent to the
'EINTR' handling on POSIX systems.  In any other case, the target may
presume that the system call has been finished -- successfully or not --
and should behave as if the break message arrived right after the system
call.

   GDB must behave reliably.  If the system call has not been called
yet, GDB may send the 'F' reply immediately, setting 'EINTR' as 'errno'
in the packet.  If the system call on the host has been finished before
the user requests a break, the full action must be finished by GDB.
This requires sending 'M' or 'X' packets as necessary.  The 'F' packet
may only be sent when either nothing has happened or the full action has
been completed.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Console I/O,  Next: List of Supported Calls,  Prev: The Ctrl-C Message,  Up: File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension

E.13.6 Console I/O
------------------

By default and if not explicitly closed by the target system, the file
descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are connected to the GDB console.  Output on the
GDB console is handled as any other file output operation ('write(1,
...)' or 'write(2, ...)').  Console input is handled by GDB so that
after the target read request from file descriptor 0 all following
typing is buffered until either one of the following conditions is met:

   * The user types 'Ctrl-c'.  The behaviour is as explained above, and
     the 'read' system call is treated as finished.

   * The user presses <RET>.  This is treated as end of input with a
     trailing newline.

   * The user types 'Ctrl-d'.  This is treated as end of input.  No
     trailing character (neither newline nor 'Ctrl-D') is appended to
     the input.

   If the user has typed more characters than fit in the buffer given to
the 'read' call, the trailing characters are buffered in GDB until
either another 'read(0, ...)' is requested by the target, or debugging
is stopped at the user's request.

          int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);

Request:
     'Fopen,PATHPTR/LEN,FLAGS,MODE'

     FLAGS is the bitwise 'OR' of the following values:

     'O_CREAT'
          If the file does not exist it will be created.  The host rules
          apply as far as file ownership and time stamps are concerned.

     'O_EXCL'
          When used with 'O_CREAT', if the file already exists it is an
          error and open() fails.

     'O_TRUNC'
          If the file already exists and the open mode allows writing
          ('O_RDWR' or 'O_WRONLY' is given) it will be truncated to zero
          length.

     'O_APPEND'
          The file is opened in append mode.

     'O_RDONLY'
          The file is opened for reading only.

     For non-zero LEN, the value returned is -1 on error and the return

     'EINTR'
          The call was interrupted by the user.

   GDB takes over the full task of calling the necessary host calls to
perform the 'system' call.  The return value of 'system' on the host is
simplified before it's returned to the target.  Any termination signal
information from the child process is discarded, and the return value
consists entirely of the exit status of the called command.

   Due to security concerns, the 'system' call is by default refused by
GDB.  The user has to allow this call explicitly with the 'set remote
system-call-allowed 1' command.

'set remote system-call-allowed'
     Control whether to allow the 'system' calls in the File I/O
     protocol for the remote target.  The default is zero (disabled).

'show remote system-call-allowed'
     Show whether the 'system' calls are allowed in the File I/O
     protocol.

File: gdb.info,  Node: Integral Datatypes,  Next: Pointer Values,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

Integral Datatypes
..................

The integral datatypes used in the system calls are 'int', 'unsigned
int', 'long', 'unsigned long', 'mode_t', and 'time_t'.

   'int', 'unsigned int', 'mode_t' and 'time_t' are implemented as 32
bit values in this protocol.

   'long' and 'unsigned long' are implemented as 64 bit types.

   *Note Limits::, for corresponding MIN and MAX values (similar to
those in 'limits.h') to allow range checking on host and target.

   'time_t' datatypes are defined as seconds since the Epoch.

   All integral datatypes transferred as part of a memory read or write
of a structured datatype e.g. a 'struct stat' have to be given in big
endian byte order.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Pointer Values,  Next: Memory Transfer,  Prev: Integral Datatypes,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

Pointer Values
..............

Pointers to target data are transmitted as they are.  An exception is
made for pointers to buffers for which the length isn't transmitted as
part of the function call, namely strings.  Strings are transmitted as a
pointer/length pair, both as hex values, e.g.

     1aaf/12

which is a pointer to data of length 18 bytes at position 0x1aaf.  The
length is defined as the full string length in bytes, including the
trailing null byte.  For example, the string '"hello world"' at address
0x123456 is transmitted as

     123456/d


File: gdb.info,  Node: Memory Transfer,  Next: struct stat,  Prev: Pointer Values,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

Memory Transfer
...............

Structured data which is transferred using a memory read or write (for
example, a 'struct stat') is expected to be in a protocol-specific
format with all scalar multibyte datatypes being big endian.
Translation to this representation needs to be done both by the target
before the 'F' packet is sent, and by GDB before it transfers memory to
the target.  Transferred pointers to structured data should point to the
already-coerced data at any time.


File: gdb.info,  Node: struct stat,  Next: struct timeval,  Prev: Memory Transfer,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

struct stat
...........

The buffer of type 'struct stat' used by the target and GDB is defined
as follows:

     struct stat {
         unsigned int  st_dev;      /* device */
         unsigned int  st_ino;      /* inode */
         mode_t        st_mode;     /* protection */
         unsigned int  st_nlink;    /* number of hard links */
         unsigned int  st_uid;      /* user ID of owner */
         unsigned int  st_gid;      /* group ID of owner */
         unsigned int  st_rdev;     /* device type (if inode device) */
         unsigned long st_size;     /* total size, in bytes */
         unsigned long st_blksize;  /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
         unsigned long st_blocks;   /* number of blocks allocated */
         time_t        st_atime;    /* time of last access */
         time_t        st_mtime;    /* time of last modification */
         time_t        st_ctime;    /* time of last change */
     };

   The integral datatypes conform to the definitions given in the
appropriate section (see *note Integral Datatypes::, for details) so
this structure is of size 64 bytes.

   The values of several fields have a restricted meaning and/or range
of values.

'st_dev'
     A value of 0 represents a file, 1 the console.

'st_ino'
     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

'st_mode'
     Valid mode bits are described in *note Constants::.  Any other bits
     have currently no meaning for the target.

'st_uid'
'st_gid'
'st_rdev'
     No valid meaning for the target.  Transmitted unchanged.

'st_atime'
'st_mtime'
'st_ctime'
     These values have a host and file system dependent accuracy.
     Especially on Windows hosts, the file system may not support exact
     timing values.

   The target gets a 'struct stat' of the above representation and is
responsible for coercing it to the target representation before
continuing.

   Note that due to size differences between the host, target, and
protocol representations of 'struct stat' members, these members could
eventually get truncated on the target.


File: gdb.info,  Node: struct timeval,  Prev: struct stat,  Up: Protocol-specific Representation of Datatypes

struct timeval
..............

The buffer of type 'struct timeval' used by the File-I/O protocol is
defined as follows:

     struct timeval {
         time_t tv_sec;  /* second */
         long   tv_usec; /* microsecond */
     };

   The integral datatypes conform to the definitions given in the
appropriate section (see *note Integral Datatypes::, for details) so
this structure is of size 8 bytes.

E.14 Library List Format
========================

On some platforms, a dynamic loader (e.g. 'ld.so') runs in the same
process as your application to manage libraries.  In this case, GDB can
use the loader's symbol table and normal memory operations to maintain a
list of shared libraries.  On other platforms, the operating system
manages loaded libraries.  GDB can not retrieve the list of currently
loaded libraries through memory operations, so it uses the
'qXfer:libraries:read' packet (*note qXfer library list read::) instead.
The remote stub queries the target's operating system and reports which
libraries are loaded.

   The 'qXfer:libraries:read' packet returns an XML document which lists
loaded libraries and their offsets.  Each library has an associated name
and one or more segment or section base addresses, which report where
the library was loaded in memory.

   For the common case of libraries that are fully linked binaries, the
library should have a list of segments.  If the target supports dynamic
linking of a relocatable object file, its library XML element should
instead include a list of allocated sections.  The segment or section
bases are start addresses, not relocation offsets; they do not depend on
the library's link-time base addresses.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML library
lists.  *Note Expat::.

   A simple memory map, with one loaded library relocated by a single
offset, looks like this:

     <library-list>
       <library name="/lib/libc.so.6">
         <segment address="0x10000000"/>
       </library>
     </library-list>

   Another simple memory map, with one loaded library with three
allocated sections (.text, .data, .bss), looks like this:

     <library-list>
       <library name="sharedlib.o">
         <section address="0x10000000"/>
         <section address="0x20000000"/>
         <section address="0x30000000"/>
       </library>
     </library-list>

   The format of a library list is described by this DTD:

     <!-- library-list: Root element with versioning -->
     <!ELEMENT library-list  (library)*>
     <!ATTLIST library-list  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">
     <!ELEMENT library       (segment*, section*)>
     <!ATTLIST library       name    CDATA   #REQUIRED>
     <!ELEMENT segment       EMPTY>
     <!ATTLIST segment       address CDATA   #REQUIRED>
     <!ELEMENT section       EMPTY>
     <!ATTLIST section       address CDATA   #REQUIRED>

   In addition, segments and section descriptors cannot be mixed within
a single library element, and you must supply at least one segment or
section for each library.

E.15 Library List Format for SVR4 Targets
=========================================

On SVR4 platforms GDB can use the symbol table of a dynamic loader (e.g.
'ld.so') and normal memory operations to maintain a list of shared
libraries.  Still a special library list provided by this packet is more
efficient for the GDB remote protocol.

   The 'qXfer:libraries-svr4:read' packet returns an XML document which
lists loaded libraries and their SVR4 linker parameters.  For each
library on SVR4 target, the following parameters are reported:

   - 'name', the absolute file name from the 'l_name' field of 'struct
     link_map'.
   - 'lm' with address of 'struct link_map' used for TLS (Thread Local
     Storage) access.
   - 'l_addr', the displacement as read from the field 'l_addr' of
     'struct link_map'.  For prelinked libraries this is not an absolute
     memory address.  It is a displacement of absolute memory address
     against address the file was prelinked to during the library load.
   - 'l_ld', which is memory address of the 'PT_DYNAMIC' segment

   Additionally the single 'main-lm' attribute specifies address of
'struct link_map' used for the main executable.  This parameter is used
for TLS access and its presence is optional.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML SVR4 library
lists.  *Note Expat::.

   A simple memory map, with two loaded libraries (which do not use
prelink), looks like this:

     <library-list-svr4 version="1.0" main-lm="0xe4f8f8">
       <library name="/lib/ld-linux.so.2" lm="0xe4f51c" l_addr="0xe2d000"
                l_ld="0xe4eefc"/>
       <library name="/lib/libc.so.6" lm="0xe4fbe8" l_addr="0x154000"
                l_ld="0x152350"/>
     </library-list-svr>

   The format of an SVR4 library list is described by this DTD:

     <!-- library-list-svr4: Root element with versioning -->
     <!ELEMENT library-list-svr4  (library)*>
     <!ATTLIST library-list-svr4  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">

E.16 Memory Map Format
======================

To be able to write into flash memory, GDB needs to obtain a memory map
from the target.  This section describes the format of the memory map.

   The memory map is obtained using the 'qXfer:memory-map:read' (*note
qXfer memory map read::) packet and is an XML document that lists memory
regions.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML memory maps.
*Note Expat::.

   The top-level structure of the document is shown below:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE memory-map
               PUBLIC "+//IDN gnu.org//DTD GDB Memory Map V1.0//EN"
                      "http://sourceware.org/gdb/gdb-memory-map.dtd">
     <memory-map>
         region...
     </memory-map>

   Each region can be either:

   * A region of RAM starting at ADDR and extending for LENGTH bytes
     from there:

          <memory type="ram" start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A region of read-only memory:

          <memory type="rom" start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A region of flash memory, with erasure blocks BLOCKSIZE bytes in
     length:

          <memory type="flash" start="ADDR" length="LENGTH">
            <property name="blocksize">BLOCKSIZE</property>
          </memory>

   Regions must not overlap.  GDB assumes that areas of memory not
covered by the memory map are RAM, and uses the ordinary 'M' and 'X'
packets to write to addresses in such ranges.

   The formal DTD for memory map format is given below:

     <!-- ................................................... -->
     <!-- Memory Map XML DTD ................................ -->
     <!-- File: memory-map.dtd .............................. -->

E.17 Thread List Format
=======================

To efficiently update the list of threads and their attributes, GDB
issues the 'qXfer:threads:read' packet (*note qXfer threads read::) and
obtains the XML document with the following structure:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <threads>
         <thread id="id" core="0">
         ... description ...
         </thread>
     </threads>

   Each 'thread' element must have the 'id' attribute that identifies
the thread (*note thread-id syntax::).  The 'core' attribute, if
present, specifies which processor core the thread was last executing
on.  The content of the of 'thread' element is interpreted as
human-readable auxilliary information.

E.18 Traceframe Info Format
===========================

To be able to know which objects in the inferior can be examined when
inspecting a tracepoint hit, GDB needs to obtain the list of memory
ranges, registers and trace state variables that have been collected in
a traceframe.

   This list is obtained using the 'qXfer:traceframe-info:read' (*note
qXfer traceframe info read::) packet and is an XML document.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML traceframe
info discovery.  *Note Expat::.

   The top-level structure of the document is shown below:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE traceframe-info
               PUBLIC "+//IDN gnu.org//DTD GDB Memory Map V1.0//EN"

     <traceframe-info>
        block...
     </traceframe-info>

   Each traceframe block can be either:

   * A region of collected memory starting at ADDR and extending for
     LENGTH bytes from there:

          <memory start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A block indicating trace state variable numbered NUMBER has been
     collected:

          <tvar id="NUMBER"/>

   The formal DTD for the traceframe info format is given below:

     <!ELEMENT traceframe-info  (memory | tvar)* >
     <!ATTLIST traceframe-info  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">

     <!ELEMENT memory        EMPTY>

E.19 Branch Trace Format
========================

In order to display the branch trace of an inferior thread, GDB needs to
obtain the list of branches.  This list is represented as list of
sequential code blocks that are connected via branches.  The code in
each block has been executed sequentially.

   This list is obtained using the 'qXfer:btrace:read' (*note qXfer
btrace read::) packet and is an XML document.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML traceframe
info discovery.  *Note Expat::.

Appendix F The GDB Agent Expression Mechanism
*********************************************

In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program's execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to
be able to observe the program's behavior without interrupting it.

   Using GDB's 'trace' and 'collect' commands, the user can specify
locations in the program, and arbitrary expressions to evaluate when
those locations are reached.  Later, using the 'tfind' command, she can
examine the values those expressions had when the program hit the trace
points.  The expressions may also denote objects in memory -- structures
or arrays, for example -- whose values GDB should record; while visiting
a particular tracepoint, the user may inspect those objects as if they
were in memory at that moment.  However, because GDB records these
values without interacting with the user, it can do so quickly and
unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program's behavior.

   When GDB is debugging a remote target, the GDB "agent" code running
on the target computes the values of the expressions itself.  To avoid
having a full symbolic expression evaluator on the agent, GDB translates
expressions in the source language into a simpler bytecode language, and
then sends the bytecode to the agent; the agent then executes the
bytecode, and records the values for GDB to retrieve later.

   The bytecode language is simple; there are forty-odd opcodes, the
bulk of which are the usual vocabulary of C operands (addition,
subtraction, shifts, and so on) and various sizes of literals and memory
reference operations.  The bytecode interpreter operates strictly on
machine-level values -- various sizes of integers and floating point
numbers -- and requires no information about types or symbols; thus, the
interpreter's internal data structures are simple, and each bytecode
requires only a few native machine instructions to implement it.  The
interpreter is small, and strict limits on the memory and time required
to evaluate an expression are easy to determine, making it suitable for
use by the debugging agent in real-time applications.

File: gdb.info,  Node: General Bytecode Design,  Next: Bytecode Descriptions,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.1 General Bytecode Design
===========================

The agent represents bytecode expressions as an array of bytes.  Each
instruction is one byte long (thus the term "bytecode").  Some
instructions are followed by operand bytes; for example, the 'goto'
instruction is followed by a destination for the jump.

   The bytecode interpreter is a stack-based machine; most instructions
pop their operands off the stack, perform some operation, and push the
result back on the stack for the next instruction to consume.  Each
element of the stack may contain either a integer or a floating point
value; these values are as many bits wide as the largest integer that
can be directly manipulated in the source language.  Stack elements
carry no record of their type; bytecode could push a value as an
integer, then pop it as a floating point value.  However, GDB will not
generate code which does this.  In C, one might define the type of a
stack element as follows:
     union agent_val {
       LONGEST l;
       DOUBLEST d;
     };
where 'LONGEST' and 'DOUBLEST' are 'typedef' names for the largest
integer and floating point types on the machine.

   By the time the bytecode interpreter reaches the end of the
expression, the value of the expression should be the only value left on
the stack.  For tracing applications, 'trace' bytecodes in the
expression will have recorded the necessary data, and the value on the
stack may be discarded.  For other applications, like conditional
breakpoints, the value may be useful.

   Separate from the stack, the interpreter has two registers:
'pc'
     The address of the next bytecode to execute.

'start'
     The address of the start of the bytecode expression, necessary for
     interpreting the 'goto' and 'if_goto' instructions.

Neither of these registers is directly visible to the bytecode language
itself, but they are useful for defining the meanings of the bytecode
operations.

   There are no instructions to perform side effects on the running
program, or call the program's functions; we assume that these
expressions are only used for unobtrusive debugging, not for patching
the running code.

   Most bytecode instructions do not distinguish between the various
sizes of values, and operate on full-width values; the upper bits of the
values are simply ignored, since they do not usually make a difference
to the value computed.  The exceptions to this rule are:

memory reference instructions ('ref'N)
     There are distinct instructions to fetch different word sizes from
     memory.  Once on the stack, however, the values are treated as
     full-size integers.  They may need to be sign-extended; the 'ext'
     instruction exists for this purpose.

the sign-extension instruction ('ext' N)
     These clearly need to know which portion of their operand is to be
     extended to occupy the full length of the word.

   If the interpreter is unable to evaluate an expression completely for
some reason (a memory location is inaccessible, or a divisor is zero,
for example), we say that interpretation "terminates with an error".
This means that the problem is reported back to the interpreter's caller
in some helpful way.  In general, code using agent expressions should
assume that they may attempt to divide by zero, fetch arbitrary memory
locations, and misbehave in other ways.

   Even complicated C expressions compile to a few bytecode
instructions; for example, the expression 'x + y * z' would typically
produce code like the following, assuming that 'x' and 'y' live in
registers, and 'z' is a global variable holding a 32-bit 'int':
     reg 1
     reg 2
     const32 address of z
     ref32
     ext 32
     mul
     add
     end

   In detail, these mean:

'reg 1'
     Push the value of register 1 (presumably holding 'x') onto the
     stack.

'reg 2'
     Push the value of register 2 (holding 'y').

'const32 address of z'
     Push the address of 'z' onto the stack.

'ref32'
     Fetch a 32-bit word from the address at the top of the stack;
     replace the address on the stack with the value.  Thus, we replace
     the address of 'z' with 'z''s value.

'ext 32'
     Sign-extend the value on the top of the stack from 32 bits to full
     length.  This is necessary because 'z' is a signed integer.

'mul'
     Pop the top two numbers on the stack, multiply them, and push their
     product.  Now the top of the stack contains the value of the
     expression 'y * z'.

'add'
     Pop the top two numbers, add them, and push the sum.  Now the top
     of the stack contains the value of 'x + y * z'.

'end'
     Stop executing; the value left on the stack top is the value to be
     recorded.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Bytecode Descriptions,  Next: Using Agent Expressions,  Prev: General Bytecode Design,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.2 Bytecode Descriptions
=========================

Each bytecode description has the following form:

'add' (0x02): A B => A+B

     Pop the top two stack items, A and B, as integers; push their sum,
     as an integer.

   In this example, 'add' is the name of the bytecode, and '(0x02)' is
the one-byte value used to encode the bytecode, in hexadecimal.  The
phrase "A B => A+B" shows the stack before and after the bytecode
executes.  Beforehand, the stack must contain at least two values, A and
B; since the top of the stack is to the right, B is on the top of the
stack, and A is underneath it.  After execution, the bytecode will have
popped A and B from the stack, and replaced them with a single value,
A+B.  There may be other values on the stack below those shown, but the
bytecode affects only those shown.

   Here is another example:

'const8' (0x22) N: => N
     Push the 8-bit integer constant N on the stack, without sign
     extension.

   In this example, the bytecode 'const8' takes an operand N directly
from the bytecode stream; the operand follows the 'const8' bytecode
itself.  We write any such operands immediately after the name of the
bytecode, before the colon, and describe the exact encoding of the
operand in the bytecode stream in the body of the bytecode description.

   For the 'const8' bytecode, there are no stack items given before the
=>; this simply means that the bytecode consumes no values from the
stack.  If a bytecode consumes no values, or produces no values, the
list on either side of the => may be empty.

   If a value is written as A, B, or N, then the bytecode treats it as
an integer.  If a value is written is ADDR, then the bytecode treats it
as an address.

   We do not fully describe the floating point operations here; although
this design can be extended in a clean way to handle floating point
values, they are not of immediate interest to the customer, so we avoid
describing them, to save time.

'float' (0x01): =>

     Prefix for floating-point bytecodes.  Not implemented yet.

'add' (0x02): A B => A+B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their sum, as an integer.

'sub' (0x03): A B => A-B
     Pop two integers from the stack, subtract the top value from the
     next-to-top value, and push the difference.

'mul' (0x04): A B => A*B
     Pop two integers from the stack, multiply them, and push the
     product on the stack.  Note that, when one multiplies two N-bit
     numbers yielding another N-bit number, it is irrelevant whether the
     numbers are signed or not; the results are the same.

'div_signed' (0x05): A B => A/B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the quotient.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'div_unsigned' (0x06): A B => A/B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the quotient.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'rem_signed' (0x07): A B => A MODULO B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the remainder.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'rem_unsigned' (0x08): A B => A MODULO B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the remainder.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

'lsh' (0x09): A B => A<<B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A left by B bits, and push the
     result.

'rsh_signed' (0x0a): A B => '(signed)'A>>B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A right by B bits, inserting copies
     of the top bit at the high end, and push the result.

'rsh_unsigned' (0x0b): A B => A>>B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A right by B bits, inserting zero
     bits at the high end, and push the result.

'log_not' (0x0e): A => !A
     Pop an integer from the stack; if it is zero, push the value one;
     otherwise, push the value zero.

'bit_and' (0x0f): A B => A&B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise 'and'.

'bit_or' (0x10): A B => A|B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise 'or'.

'bit_xor' (0x11): A B => A^B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise
     exclusive-'or'.

'bit_not' (0x12): A => ~A
     Pop an integer from the stack, and push its bitwise complement.

'equal' (0x13): A B => A=B
     Pop two integers from the stack; if they are equal, push the value
     one; otherwise, push the value zero.

'less_signed' (0x14): A B => A<B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; if the next-to-top value is
     less than the top value, push the value one; otherwise, push the
     value zero.

'less_unsigned' (0x15): A B => A<B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; if the next-to-top value
     is less than the top value, push the value one; otherwise, push the
     value zero.

'ext' (0x16) N: A => A, sign-extended from N bits
     Pop an unsigned value from the stack; treating it as an N-bit
     twos-complement value, extend it to full length.  This means that
     all bits to the left of bit N-1 (where the least significant bit is
     bit 0) are set to the value of bit N-1.  Note that N may be larger
     than or equal to the width of the stack elements of the bytecode
     engine; in this case, the bytecode should have no effect.

     The number of source bits to preserve, N, is encoded as a single
     byte unsigned integer following the 'ext' bytecode.

'zero_ext' (0x2a) N: A => A, zero-extended from N bits
     Pop an unsigned value from the stack; zero all but the bottom N
     bits.  This means that all bits to the left of bit N-1 (where the
     least significant bit is bit 0) are set to the value of bit N-1.

     The number of source bits to preserve, N, is encoded as a single
     byte unsigned integer following the 'zero_ext' bytecode.

'ref8' (0x17): ADDR => A
'ref16' (0x18): ADDR => A
'ref32' (0x19): ADDR => A
'ref64' (0x1a): ADDR => A
     Pop an address ADDR from the stack.  For bytecode 'ref'N, fetch an
     N-bit value from ADDR, using the natural target endianness.  Push
     the fetched value as an unsigned integer.

     Note that ADDR may not be aligned in any particular way; the 'refN'
     bytecodes should operate correctly for any address.

     If attempting to access memory at ADDR would cause a processor
     exception of some sort, terminate with an error.

'ref_float' (0x1b): ADDR => D
'ref_double' (0x1c): ADDR => D
'ref_long_double' (0x1d): ADDR => D
'l_to_d' (0x1e): A => D
'd_to_l' (0x1f): D => A
     Not implemented yet.

'dup' (0x28): A => A A
     Push another copy of the stack's top element.

'swap' (0x2b): A B => B A
     Exchange the top two items on the stack.

'pop' (0x29): A =>
     Discard the top value on the stack.

'pick' (0x32) N: A ... B => A ... B A
     Duplicate an item from the stack and push it on the top of the
     stack.  N, a single byte, indicates the stack item to copy.  If N
     is zero, this is the same as 'dup'; if N is one, it copies the item
     under the top item, etc.  If N exceeds the number of items on the
     stack, terminate with an error.

'rot' (0x33): A B C => C B A
     Rotate the top three items on the stack.

'if_goto' (0x20) OFFSET: A =>
     Pop an integer off the stack; if it is non-zero, branch to the
     given offset in the bytecode string.  Otherwise, continue to the
     next instruction in the bytecode stream.  In other words, if A is
     non-zero, set the 'pc' register to 'start' + OFFSET.  Thus, an
     offset of zero denotes the beginning of the expression.

     The OFFSET is stored as a sixteen-bit unsigned value, stored
     immediately following the 'if_goto' bytecode.  It is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The offset is not guaranteed to fall at any particular
     alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where
     fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you
     should fetch the offset one byte at a time.

'goto' (0x21) OFFSET: =>
     Branch unconditionally to OFFSET; in other words, set the 'pc'
     register to 'start' + OFFSET.

     The offset is stored in the same way as for the 'if_goto' bytecode.

'const8' (0x22) N: => N
'const16' (0x23) N: => N
'const32' (0x24) N: => N
'const64' (0x25) N: => N
     Push the integer constant N on the stack, without sign extension.
     To produce a small negative value, push a small twos-complement
     value, and then sign-extend it using the 'ext' bytecode.

     The constant N is stored in the appropriate number of bytes
     following the 'const'B bytecode.  The constant N is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The constant is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch N one byte at a time.

'reg' (0x26) N: => A
     Push the value of register number N, without sign extension.  The
     registers are numbered following GDB's conventions.

     The register number N is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
     immediately following the 'reg' bytecode.  It is always stored most
     significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The register number is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch the register number one byte at a time.

'getv' (0x2c) N: => V
     Push the value of trace state variable number N, without sign
     extension.

     The variable number N is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
     immediately following the 'getv' bytecode.  It is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The variable number is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch the register number one byte at a time.

'setv' (0x2d) N: => V
     Set trace state variable number N to the value found on the top of
     the stack.  The stack is unchanged, so that the value is readily
     available if the assignment is part of a larger expression.  The
     handling of N is as described for 'getv'.

'trace' (0x0c): ADDR SIZE =>
     Record the contents of the SIZE bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer,
     for later retrieval by GDB.

'trace_quick' (0x0d) SIZE: ADDR => ADDR
     Record the contents of the SIZE bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer,
     for later retrieval by GDB. SIZE is a single byte unsigned integer
     following the 'trace' opcode.

     This bytecode is equivalent to the sequence 'dup const8 SIZE
     trace', but we provide it anyway to save space in bytecode strings.

'trace16' (0x30) SIZE: ADDR => ADDR
     Identical to trace_quick, except that SIZE is a 16-bit big-endian
     unsigned integer, not a single byte.  This should probably have
     been named 'trace_quick16', for consistency.

'tracev' (0x2e) N: => A
     Record the value of trace state variable number N in the trace
     buffer.  The handling of N is as described for 'getv'.

'tracenz' (0x2f) ADDR SIZE =>
     Record the bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer, for later retrieval by
     GDB. Stop at either the first zero byte, or when SIZE bytes have
     been recorded, whichever occurs first.

'printf' (0x34) NUMARGS STRING =>
     Do a formatted print, in the style of the C function 'printf').
     The value of NUMARGS is the number of arguments to expect on the
     stack, while STRING is the format string, prefixed with a two-byte
     length.  The last byte of the string must be zero, and is included
     in the length.  The format string includes escaped sequences just
     as it appears in C source, so for instance the format string
     '"\t%d\n"' is six characters long, and the output will consist of a
     tab character, a decimal number, and a newline.  At the top of the
     stack, above the values to be printed, this bytecode will pop a
     "function" and "channel".  If the function is nonzero, then the
     target may treat it as a function and call it, passing the channel
     as a first argument, as with the C function 'fprintf'.  If the
     function is zero, then the target may simply call a standard
     formatted print function of its choice.  In all, this bytecode pops
     2 + NUMARGS stack elements, and pushes nothing.

'end' (0x27): =>
     Stop executing bytecode; the result should be the top element of
     the stack.  If the purpose of the expression was to compute an
     lvalue or a range of memory, then the next-to-top of the stack is
     the lvalue's address, and the top of the stack is the lvalue's
     size, in bytes.

F.3 Using Agent Expressions
===========================

Agent expressions can be used in several different ways by GDB, and the
debugger can generate different bytecode sequences as appropriate.

   One possibility is to do expression evaluation on the target rather
than the host, such as for the conditional of a conditional tracepoint.
In such a case, GDB compiles the source expression into a bytecode
sequence that simply gets values from registers or memory, does
arithmetic, and returns a result.

   Another way to use agent expressions is for tracepoint data
collection.  GDB generates a different bytecode sequence for collection;
in addition to bytecodes that do the calculation, GDB adds 'trace'
bytecodes to save the pieces of memory that were used.

   * The user selects trace points in the program's code at which GDB
     should collect data.

   * The user specifies expressions to evaluate at each trace point.
     These expressions may denote objects in memory, in which case those
     objects' contents are recorded as the program runs, or computed
     values, in which case the values themselves are recorded.

   * GDB transmits the tracepoints and their associated expressions to
     the GDB agent, running on the debugging target.

   * The agent arranges to be notified when a trace point is hit.

   * When execution on the target reaches a trace point, the agent
     evaluates the expressions associated with that trace point, and
     records the resulting values and memory ranges.

   * Later, when the user selects a given trace event and inspects the
     objects and expression values recorded, GDB talks to the agent to
     retrieve recorded data as necessary to meet the user's requests.
     If the user asks to see an object whose contents have not been
     recorded, GDB reports an error.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Varying Target Capabilities,  Next: Rationale,  Prev: Using Agent Expressions,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.4 Varying Target Capabilities
===============================

Some targets don't support floating-point, and some would rather not
have to deal with 'long long' operations.  Also, different targets will
have different stack sizes, and different bytecode buffer lengths.

   Thus, GDB needs a way to ask the target about itself.  We haven't
worked out the details yet, but in general, GDB should be able to send
the target a packet asking it to describe itself.  The reply should be a
packet whose length is explicit, so we can add new information to the
packet in future revisions of the agent, without confusing old versions
of GDB, and it should contain a version number.  It should contain at
least the following information:

   * whether floating point is supported

   * whether 'long long' is supported

   * maximum acceptable size of bytecode stack

   * maximum acceptable length of bytecode expressions

   * which registers are actually available for collection

   * whether the target supports disabled tracepoints


File: gdb.info,  Node: Rationale,  Prev: Varying Target Capabilities,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.5 Rationale
=============

Some of the design decisions apparent above are arguable.

What about stack overflow/underflow?
     GDB should be able to query the target to discover its stack size.
     Given that information, GDB can determine at translation time
     whether a given expression will overflow the stack.  But this spec
     isn't about what kinds of error-checking GDB ought to do.

Why are you doing everything in LONGEST?

     Speed isn't important, but agent code size is; using LONGEST brings
     in a bunch of support code to do things like division, etc.  So
     this is a serious concern.

     First, note that you don't need different bytecodes for different
     operand sizes.  You can generate code without _knowing_ how big the
     stack elements actually are on the target.  If the target only
     supports 32-bit ints, and you don't send any 64-bit bytecodes,
     everything just works.  The observation here is that the MIPS and
     the Alpha have only fixed-size registers, and you can still get C's
     semantics even though most instructions only operate on full-sized
     words.  You just need to make sure everything is properly
     sign-extended at the right times.  So there is no need for 32- and
     64-bit variants of the bytecodes.  Just implement everything using
     the largest size you support.

     GDB should certainly check to see what sizes the target supports,
     so the user can get an error earlier, rather than later.  But this
     information is not necessary for correctness.

Why don't you have '>' or '<=' operators?
     I want to keep the interpreter small, and we don't need them.  We
     can combine the 'less_' opcodes with 'log_not', and swap the order
     of the operands, yielding all four asymmetrical comparison
     operators.  For example, '(x <= y)' is '! (x > y)', which is '! (y
     < x)'.

Why do you have 'log_not'?
Why do you have 'ext'?
Why do you have 'zero_ext'?
     These are all easily synthesized from other instructions, but I
     expect them to be used frequently, and they're simple, so I include
     them to keep bytecode strings short.

     'log_not' is equivalent to 'const8 0 equal'; it's used in half the
     relational operators.

     'ext N' is equivalent to 'const8 S-N lsh const8 S-N rsh_signed',
     where S is the size of the stack elements; it follows 'refM' and
     REG bytecodes when the value should be signed.  See the next
     bulleted item.

     'zero_ext N' is equivalent to 'constM MASK log_and'; it's used
     whenever we push the value of a register, because we can't assume
     the upper bits of the register aren't garbage.

Why not have sign-extending variants of the 'ref' operators?
     Because that would double the number of 'ref' operators, and we
     need the 'ext' bytecode anyway for accessing bitfields.

Why not have constant-address variants of the 'ref' operators?
     Because that would double the number of 'ref' operators again, and
     'const32 ADDRESS ref32' is only one byte longer.

Why do the 'refN' operators have to support unaligned fetches?
     GDB will generate bytecode that fetches multi-byte values at
     unaligned addresses whenever the executable's debugging information
     tells it to.  Furthermore, GDB does not know the value the pointer
     will have when GDB generates the bytecode, so it cannot determine
     whether a particular fetch will be aligned or not.

     In particular, structure bitfields may be several bytes long, but
     follow no alignment rules; members of packed structures are not
     necessarily aligned either.

     In general, there are many cases where unaligned references occur
     in correct C code, either at the programmer's explicit request, or
     at the compiler's discretion.  Thus, it is simpler to make the GDB
     agent bytecodes work correctly in all circumstances than to make
     GDB guess in each case whether the compiler did the usual thing.

Why are there no side-effecting operators?
     Because our current client doesn't want them?  That's a cheap
     answer.  I think the real answer is that I'm afraid of implementing
     function calls.  We should re-visit this issue after the present
     contract is delivered.

Why aren't the 'goto' ops PC-relative?
     The interpreter has the base address around anyway for PC bounds
     checking, and it seemed simpler.

Why is there only one offset size for the 'goto' ops?
     Offsets are currently sixteen bits.  I'm not happy with this
     situation either:

     Suppose we have multiple branch ops with different offset sizes.
     As I generate code left-to-right, all my jumps are forward jumps
     (there are no loops in expressions), so I never know the target
     when I emit the jump opcode.  Thus, I have to either always assume
     the largest offset size, or do jump relaxation on the code after I
     generate it, which seems like a big waste of time.

     I can imagine a reasonable expression being longer than 256 bytes.
     I can't imagine one being longer than 64k.  Thus, we need 16-bit
     offsets.  This kind of reasoning is so bogus, but relaxation is
     pathetic.

     The other approach would be to generate code right-to-left.  Then
     I'd always know my offset size.  That might be fun.

Where is the function call bytecode?

     When we add side-effects, we should add this.

Why does the 'reg' bytecode take a 16-bit register number?

     Intel's IA-64 architecture has 128 general-purpose registers, and
     128 floating-point registers, and I'm sure it has some random
     control registers.

Why do we need 'trace' and 'trace_quick'?
     Because GDB needs to record all the memory contents and registers
     an expression touches.  If the user wants to evaluate an expression
     'x->y->z', the agent must record the values of 'x' and 'x->y' as
     well as the value of 'x->y->z'.

Don't the 'trace' bytecodes make the interpreter less general?
     They do mean that the interpreter contains special-purpose code,
     but that doesn't mean the interpreter can only be used for that
     purpose.  If an expression doesn't use the 'trace' bytecodes, they
     don't get in its way.

Why doesn't 'trace_quick' consume its arguments the way everything else does?
     In general, you do want your operators to consume their arguments;
     it's consistent, and generally reduces the amount of stack
     rearrangement necessary.  However, 'trace_quick' is a kludge to
     save space; it only exists so we needn't write 'dup const8 SIZE
     trace' before every memory reference.  Therefore, it's okay for it
     not to consume its arguments; it's meant for a specific context in
     which we know exactly what it should do with the stack.  If we're
     going to have a kludge, it should be an effective kludge.

Why does 'trace16' exist?
     That opcode was added by the customer that contracted Cygnus for
     the data tracing work.  I personally think it is unnecessary;
     objects that large will be quite rare, so it is okay to use 'dup
     const16 SIZE trace' in those cases.

     Whatever we decide to do with 'trace16', we should at least leave
     opcode 0x30 reserved, to remain compatible with the customer who
     added it.

Appendix G Target Descriptions
******************************

One of the challenges of using GDB to debug embedded systems is that
there are so many minor variants of each processor architecture in use.
It is common practice for vendors to start with a standard processor
core -- ARM, PowerPC, or MIPS, for example -- and then make changes to
adapt it to a particular market niche.  Some architectures have hundreds
of variants, available from dozens of vendors.  This leads to a number
of problems:

   * With so many different customized processors, it is difficult for
     the GDB maintainers to keep up with the changes.
   * Since individual variants may have short lifetimes or limited
     audiences, it may not be worthwhile to carry information about
     every variant in the GDB source tree.
   * When GDB does support the architecture of the embedded system at
     hand, the task of finding the correct architecture name to give the
     'set architecture' command can be error-prone.

   To address these problems, the GDB remote protocol allows a target
system to not only identify itself to GDB, but to actually describe its
own features.  This lets GDB support processor variants it has never
seen before -- to the extent that the descriptions are accurate, and
that GDB understands them.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML target
descriptions.  *Note Expat::.

* Menu:

* Retrieving Descriptions::         How descriptions are fetched from a target.
* Target Description Format::       The contents of a target description.
* Predefined Target Types::         Standard types available for target
                                    descriptions.
* Standard Target Features::        Features GDB knows about.

G.1 Retrieving Descriptions
===========================

Target descriptions can be read from the target automatically, or
specified by the user manually.  The default behavior is to read the
description from the target.  GDB retrieves it via the remote protocol
using 'qXfer' requests (*note qXfer: General Query Packets.).  The ANNEX
in the 'qXfer' packet will be 'target.xml'.  The contents of the
'target.xml' annex are an XML document, of the form described in *note
Target Description Format::.

   Alternatively, you can specify a file to read for the target
description.  If a file is set, the target will not be queried.  The
commands to specify a file are:

'set tdesc filename PATH'
     Read the target description from PATH.

'unset tdesc filename'
     Do not read the XML target description from a file.  GDB will use
     the description supplied by the current target.

'show tdesc filename'
     Show the filename to read for a target description, if any.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Target Description Format,  Next: Predefined Target Types,  Prev: Retrieving Descriptions,  Up: Target Descriptions

G.2 Target Description Format
=============================

A target description annex is an XML (http://www.w3.org/XML/) document
which complies with the Document Type Definition provided in the GDB
sources in 'gdb/features/gdb-target.dtd'.  This means you can use
generally available tools like 'xmllint' to check that your feature
descriptions are well-formed and valid.  However, to help people
unfamiliar with XML write descriptions for their targets, we also
describe the grammar here.

   Target descriptions can identify the architecture of the remote
target and (for some architectures) provide information about custom
register sets.  They can also identify the OS ABI of the remote target.
GDB can use this information to autoconfigure for your target, or to
warn you if you connect to an unsupported target.

   Here is a simple target description:

     <target version="1.0">
       <architecture>i386:x86-64</architecture>
     </target>

This minimal description only says that the target uses the x86-64
architecture.

   A target description has the following overall form, with [ ] marking
optional elements and ... marking repeatable elements.  The elements are
explained further below.

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "gdb-target.dtd">
     <target version="1.0">
       [ARCHITECTURE]
       [OSABI]
       [COMPATIBLE]
       [FEATURE...]
     </target>

The description is generally insensitive to whitespace and line breaks,
under the usual common-sense rules.  The XML version declaration and
document type declaration can generally be omitted (GDB does not require
them), but specifying them may be useful for XML validation tools.  The
'version' attribute for '<target>' may also be omitted, but we recommend
including it; if future versions of GDB use an incompatible revision of
'gdb-target.dtd', they will detect and report the version mismatch.

G.2.1 Inclusion
---------------

It can sometimes be valuable to split a target description up into
several different annexes, either for organizational purposes, or to
share files between different possible target descriptions.  You can
divide a description into multiple files by replacing any element of the
target description with an inclusion directive of the form:

     <xi:include href="DOCUMENT"/>

When GDB encounters an element of this form, it will retrieve the named
XML DOCUMENT, and replace the inclusion directive with the contents of
that document.  If the current description was read using 'qXfer', then
so will be the included document; DOCUMENT will be interpreted as the
name of an annex.  If the current description was read from a file, GDB
will look for DOCUMENT as a file in the same directory where it found
the original description.

G.2.2 Architecture
------------------

An '<architecture>' element has this form:

       <architecture>ARCH</architecture>

   ARCH is one of the architectures from the set accepted by 'set
architecture' (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

G.2.3 OS ABI
------------

This optional field was introduced in GDB version 7.0.  Previous
versions of GDB ignore it.

   An '<osabi>' element has this form:

       <osabi>ABI-NAME</osabi>

   ABI-NAME is an OS ABI name from the same selection accepted by 'set osabi'
(*note Configuring the Current ABI: ABI.).

G.2.4 Compatible Architecture
-----------------------------

This optional field was introduced in GDB version 7.0.  Previous
versions of GDB ignore it.

   A '<compatible>' element has this form:

       <compatible>ARCH</compatible>

   ARCH is one of the architectures from the set accepted by 'set
architecture' (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

   A '<compatible>' element is used to specify that the target is able
to run binaries in some other than the main target architecture given by
the '<architecture>' element.  For example, on the Cell Broadband
Engine, the main architecture is 'powerpc:common' or 'powerpc:common64',
but the system is able to run binaries in the 'spu' architecture as
well.  The way to describe this capability with '<compatible>' is as
follows:

       <architecture>powerpc:common</architecture>
       <compatible>spu</compatible>

G.2.5 Features
--------------

Each '<feature>' describes some logical portion of the target system.
Features are currently used to describe available CPU registers and the
types of their contents.  A '<feature>' element has this form:

     <feature name="NAME">
       [TYPE...]
       REG...
     </feature>

Each feature's name should be unique within the description.  The name
of a feature does not matter unless GDB has some special knowledge of
the contents of that feature; if it does, the feature should have its
standard name.  *Note Standard Target Features::.

G.2.6 Types
-----------

Any register's value is a collection of bits which GDB must interpret.
The default interpretation is a two's complement integer, but other
types can be requested by name in the register description.  Some
predefined types are provided by GDB (*note Predefined Target Types::),
and the description can define additional composite types.

   Each type element must have an 'id' attribute, which gives a unique
(within the containing '<feature>') name to the type.  Types must be
defined before they are used.

   Some targets offer vector registers, which can be treated as arrays
of scalar elements.  These types are written as '<vector>' elements,
specifying the array element type, TYPE, and the number of elements,
COUNT:

     <vector id="ID" type="TYPE" count="COUNT"/>

   If a register's value is usefully viewed in multiple ways, define it
with a union type containing the useful representations.  The '<union>'
element contains one or more '<field>' elements, each of which has a
NAME and a TYPE:

     <union id="ID">
       <field name="NAME" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </union>

   If a register's value is composed from several separate values,
define it with a structure type.  There are two forms of the '<struct>'
element; a '<struct>' element must either contain only bitfields or
contain no bitfields.  If the structure contains only bitfields, its
total size in bytes must be specified, each bitfield must have an
explicit start and end, and bitfields are automatically assigned an
integer type.  The field's START should be less than or equal to its
END, and zero represents the least significant bit.

     <struct id="ID" size="SIZE">
       <field name="NAME" start="START" end="END"/>
       ...
     </struct>

   If the structure contains no bitfields, then each field has an
explicit type, and no implicit padding is added.

     <struct id="ID">
       <field name="NAME" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </struct>

   If a register's value is a series of single-bit flags, define it with
a flags type.  The '<flags>' element has an explicit SIZE and contains
one or more '<field>' elements.  Each field has a NAME, a START, and an
END.  Only single-bit flags are supported.

     <flags id="ID" size="SIZE">
       <field name="NAME" start="START" end="END"/>
       ...
     </flags>

G.2.7 Registers
---------------

Each register is represented as an element with this form:

     <reg name="NAME"
          bitsize="SIZE"
          [regnum="NUM"]
          [save-restore="SAVE-RESTORE"]
          [type="TYPE"]
          [group="GROUP"]/>

The components are as follows:

NAME
     The register's name; it must be unique within the target
     description.

BITSIZE
     The register's size, in bits.

REGNUM
     The register's number.  If omitted, a register's number is one
     greater than that of the previous register (either in the current
     feature or in a preceding feature); the first register in the
     target description defaults to zero.  This register number is used
     to read or write the register; e.g. it is used in the remote 'p'
     and 'P' packets, and registers appear in the 'g' and 'G' packets in
     order of increasing register number.

SAVE-RESTORE
     Whether the register should be preserved across inferior function
     calls; this must be either 'yes' or 'no'.  The default is 'yes',
     which is appropriate for most registers except for some system
     control registers; this is not related to the target's ABI.

TYPE
     The type of the register.  It may be a predefined type, a type
     defined in the current feature, or one of the special types 'int'
     and 'float'.  'int' is an integer type of the correct size for
     BITSIZE, and 'float' is a floating point type (in the
     architecture's normal floating point format) of the correct size
     for BITSIZE.  The default is 'int'.

GROUP
     The register group to which this register belongs.  It must be
     either 'general', 'float', or 'vector'.  If no GROUP is specified,
     GDB will not display the register in 'info registers'.

G.3 Predefined Target Types
===========================

Type definitions in the self-description can build up composite types
from basic building blocks, but can not define fundamental types.
Instead, standard identifiers are provided by GDB for the fundamental
types.  The currently supported types are:

'int8'
'int16'
'int32'
'int64'
'int128'
     Signed integer types holding the specified number of bits.

'uint8'
'uint16'
'uint32'
'uint64'
'uint128'
     Unsigned integer types holding the specified number of bits.

'code_ptr'
'data_ptr'
     Pointers to unspecified code and data.  The program counter and any
     dedicated return address register may be marked as code pointers;
     printing a code pointer converts it into a symbolic address.  The
     stack pointer and any dedicated address registers may be marked as
     data pointers.

'ieee_single'
     Single precision IEEE floating point.

'ieee_double'
     Double precision IEEE floating point.

'arm_fpa_ext'
     The 12-byte extended precision format used by ARM FPA registers.

'i387_ext'
     The 10-byte extended precision format used by x87 registers.

'i386_eflags'
     32bit EFLAGS register used by x86.

'i386_mxcsr'
     32bit MXCSR register used by x86.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Standard Target Features,  Prev: Predefined Target Types,  Up: Target Descriptions

G.4 Standard Target Features
============================

A target description must contain either no registers or all the
target's registers.  If the description contains no registers, then GDB
will assume a default register layout, selected based on the
architecture.  If the description contains any registers, the default
layout will not be used; the standard registers must be described in the
target description, in such a way that GDB can recognize them.

   This is accomplished by giving specific names to feature elements
which contain standard registers.  GDB will look for features with those
names and verify that they contain the expected registers; if any known
feature is missing required registers, or if any required feature is
missing, GDB will reject the target description.  You can add additional
registers to any of the standard features -- GDB will display them just
as if they were added to an unrecognized feature.

   This section lists the known features and their expected contents.
Sample XML documents for these features are included in the GDB source
tree, in the directory 'gdb/features'.

   Names recognized by GDB should include the name of the company or
organization which selected the name, and the overall architecture to
which the feature applies; so e.g. the feature containing ARM core
registers is named 'org.gnu.gdb.arm.core'.

   The names of registers are not case sensitive for the purpose of
recognizing standard features, but GDB will only display registers using
the capitalization used in the description.

Appendix H Operating System Information
***************************************

* Menu:

* Process list::

Users of GDB often wish to obtain information about the state of the
operating system running on the target--for example the list of
processes, or the list of open files.  This section describes the
mechanism that makes it possible.  This mechanism is similar to the
target features mechanism (*note Target Descriptions::), but focuses on
a different aspect of target.

   Operating system information is retrived from the target via the
remote protocol, using 'qXfer' requests (*note qXfer osdata read::).
The object name in the request should be 'osdata', and the ANNEX
identifies the data to be fetched.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Process list,  Up: Operating System Information

H.1 Process list
================

When requesting the process list, the ANNEX field in the 'qXfer' request
should be 'processes'.  The returned data is an XML document.  The
formal syntax of this document is defined in 'gdb/features/osdata.dtd'.

   An example document is:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "osdata.dtd">
     <osdata type="processes">
       <item>
         <column name="pid">1</column>
         <column name="user">root</column>
         <column name="command">/sbin/init</column>
         <column name="cores">1,2,3</column>
       </item>
     </osdata>

   Each item should include a column whose name is 'pid'.  The value of
that column should identify the process on the target.  The 'user' and
'command' columns are optional, and will be displayed by GDB.  The
'cores' column, if present, should contain a comma-separated list of
cores that this process is running on.  Target may provide additional
columns, which GDB currently ignores.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Trace File Format,  Next: Index Section Format,  Prev: Operating System Information,  Up: Top

Appendix I Trace File Format
****************************

The trace file comes in three parts: a header, a textual description
section, and a trace frame section with binary data.

   The header has the form '\x7fTRACE0\n'.  The first byte is '0x7f' so
as to indicate that the file contains binary data, while the '0' is a
version number that may have different values in the future.

   The description section consists of multiple lines of ASCII text
separated by newline characters ('0xa').  The lines may include a
variety of optional descriptive or context-setting information, such as
tracepoint definitions or register set size.  GDB will ignore any line
that it does not recognize.  An empty line marks the end of this
section.

   The trace frame section consists of a number of consecutive frames.
Each frame begins with a two-byte tracepoint number, followed by a
four-byte size giving the amount of data in the frame.  The data in the
frame consists of a number of blocks, each introduced by a character
indicating its type (at least register, memory, and trace state
variable).  The data in this section is raw binary, not a hexadecimal or
other encoding; its endianness matches the target's endianness.

'R BYTES'
     Register block.  The number and ordering of bytes matches that of a
     'g' packet in the remote protocol.  Note that these are the actual
     bytes, in target order and GDB register order, not a hexadecimal
     encoding.

'M ADDRESS LENGTH BYTES...'
     Memory block.  This is a contiguous block of memory, at the 8-byte
     address ADDRESS, with a 2-byte length LENGTH, followed by LENGTH
     bytes.

'V NUMBER VALUE'
     Trace state variable block.  This records the 8-byte signed value
     VALUE of trace state variable numbered NUMBER.

   Future enhancements of the trace file format may include additional
types of blocks.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Index Section Format,  Next: Man Pages,  Prev: Trace File Format,  Up: Top

Appendix J '.gdb_index' section format
**************************************

This section documents the index section that is created by 'save
gdb-index' (*note Index Files::).  The index section is DWARF-specific;
some knowledge of DWARF is assumed in this description.

   The mapped index file format is designed to be directly 'mmap'able on
any architecture.  In most cases, a datum is represented using a
little-endian 32-bit integer value, called an 'offset_type'.  Big endian
machines must byte-swap the values before using them.  Exceptions to
this rule are noted.  The data is laid out such that alignment is always
respected.

   A mapped index consists of several areas, laid out in order.

  1. The file header.  This is a sequence of values, of 'offset_type'
     unless otherwise noted:

       1. The version number, currently 8.  Versions 1, 2 and 3 are
          obsolete.  Version 4 uses a different hashing function from
          versions 5 and 6.  Version 6 includes symbols for inlined
          functions, whereas versions 4 and 5 do not.  Version 7 adds
          attributes to the CU indices in the symbol table.  Version 8
          specifies that symbols from DWARF type units
          ('DW_TAG_type_unit') refer to the type unit's symbol table and
          not the compilation unit ('DW_TAG_comp_unit') using the type.

          GDB will only read version 4, 5, or 6 indices by specifying
          'set use-deprecated-index-sections on'.  GDB has a workaround
          for potentially broken version 7 indices so it is currently
          not flagged as deprecated.

       2. The offset, from the start of the file, of the CU list.

       3. The offset, from the start of the file, of the types CU list.
          Note that this area can be empty, in which case this offset
          will be equal to the next offset.

       4. The offset, from the start of the file, of the address area.

       5. The offset, from the start of the file, of the symbol table.

       6. The offset, from the start of the file, of the constant pool.

  2. The CU list.  This is a sequence of pairs of 64-bit little-endian
     values, sorted by the CU offset.  The first element in each pair is
     the offset of a CU in the '.debug_info' section.  The second
     element in each pair is the length of that CU. References to a CU
     elsewhere in the map are done using a CU index, which is just the
     0-based index into this table.  Note that if there are type CUs,
     then conceptually CUs and type CUs form a single list for the
     purposes of CU indices.

  3. The types CU list.  This is a sequence of triplets of 64-bit
     little-endian values.  In a triplet, the first value is the CU
     offset, the second value is the type offset in the CU, and the
     third value is the type signature.  The types CU list is not
     sorted.

  4. The address area.  The address area consists of a sequence of
     address entries.  Each address entry has three elements:

       1. The low address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.

       2. The high address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.  Like
          'DW_AT_high_pc', the value is one byte beyond the end.

       3. The CU index.  This is an 'offset_type' value.

  5. The symbol table.  This is an open-addressed hash table.  The size
     of the hash table is always a power of 2.

     Each slot in the hash table consists of a pair of 'offset_type'
     values.  The first value is the offset of the symbol's name in the
     constant pool.  The second value is the offset of the CU vector in
     the constant pool.

     If both values are 0, then this slot in the hash table is empty.
     This is ok because while 0 is a valid constant pool index, iPK
