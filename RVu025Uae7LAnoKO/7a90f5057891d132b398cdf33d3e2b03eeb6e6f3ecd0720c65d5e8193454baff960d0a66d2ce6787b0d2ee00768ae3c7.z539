     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBaddr2line\fR translates addresses into file names and line numbers.
Given an address in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable
object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and
line number are associated with it.
.PP
The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the \fB\-e\fR
option.  The default is the file \fIa.out\fR.  The section in the relocatable
object to use is specified with the \fB\-j\fR option.
.PP
\&\fBaddr2line\fR has two modes of operation.
.PP
In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line,
and \fBaddr2line\fR displays the file name and line number for each
address.
.PP
In the second, \fBaddr2line\fR reads hexadecimal addresses from
standard input, and prints the file name and line number for each
address on standard output.  In this mode, \fBaddr2line\fR may be used
in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen addresses.
.PP
The format of the output is \fB\s-1FILENAME:LINENO\s0\fR.  The file name and
line number for each input address is printed on separate lines.
.PP
If the \fB\-f\fR option is used, then each \fB\s-1FILENAME:LINENO\s0\fR
line is preceded by \fB\s-1FUNCTIONNAME\s0\fR which is the name of the
function containing the address.
.PP
If the \fB\-i\fR option is used and the code at the given address is
present there because of inlining by the compiler then the
\&\fB{\s-1FUNCTIONNAME\s0} \s-1FILENAME:LINENO\s0\fR information for the inlining
function will be displayed afterwards.  This continues recursively
until there is no more inlining to report.
.PP
If the \fB\-a\fR option is used then the output is prefixed by the
input address.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fR option is used then the output for each input
address is displayed on one, possibly quite long, line.  If
\&\fB\-p\fR is not used then the output is broken up into multiple
lines, based on the paragraphs above.
.PP
If the file name or function name can not be determined,
\&\fBaddr2line\fR will print two question marks in their place.  If the
line number can not be determined, \fBaddr2line\fR will print 0.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-addresses\fR" 4
.IX Item "--addresses"
.PD
Display the address before the function name, file and line number
information.  The address is printed with a \fB0x\fR prefix to easily
identify it.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIbfdname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b bfdname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-target=\fR\fIbfdname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target=bfdname"
.PD
Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
\&\fIbfdname\fR.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-demangle[=\fR\fIstyle\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--demangle[=style]"
.PD
Decode (\fIdemangle\fR) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
makes \*(C+ function names readable.  Different compilers have different
mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to
choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-exe=\fR\fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exe=filename"
.PD
Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
translated.  The default file is \fIa.out\fR.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "--functions"
.PD
Display function names as well as file and line number information.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-basenames\fR" 4
.IX Item "--basenames"
.PD
Display only the base of each file name.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "--inlines"
.PD
If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source
information for all enclosing scopes back to the first non-inlined
function will also be printed.  For example, if \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR inlines
\&\f(CW\*(C`callee1\*(C'\fR which inlines \f(CW\*(C`callee2\*(C'\fR, and address is from
\&\f(CW\*(C`callee2\*(C'\fR, the source information for \f(CW\*(C`callee1\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
will also be printed.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR" 4
.IX Item "-j"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section"
.PD
Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-pretty\-print\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pretty-print"
.PD
Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on one line.
If option \fB\-i\fR is specified, lines for all enclosing scopes are
prefixed with \fB(inlined by)\fR.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR program creates, modifies, and extracts from
archives.  An \fIarchive\fR is a single file holding a collection of
other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve
the original individual files (called \fImembers\fR of the archive).
.PP
The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and
group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
extraction.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR can maintain archives whose members have names of any
length; however, depending on how \fBar\fR is configured on your
system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility
with archive formats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the
limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16
characters (typical of formats related to coff).
.PP
\&\fBar\fR is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort
are most often used as \fIlibraries\fR holding commonly needed
subroutines.
.PP
\&\fBar\fR creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable
object modules in the archive when you specify the modifier \fBs\fR.
Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever \fBar\fR
makes a change to its contents (save for the \fBq\fR update operation).
An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.
.PP
You may use \fBnm \-s\fR or \fBnm \-\-print\-armap\fR to list this index
table.  If an archive lacks the table, another form of \fBar\fR called
\&\fBranlib\fR can be used to add just the table.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR can optionally create a \fIthin\fR archive,
which contains a symbol index and references to the original copies
of the member files of the archive.  This is useful for building
libraries for use within a local build tree, where the relocatable
objects are expected to remain available, and copying the contents of
each object would only waste time and space.
.PP
An archive can either be \fIthin\fR or it can be normal.  It cannot
be both at the same time.  Once an archive is created its format
cannot be changed without first deleting it and then creating a new
archive in its place.
.PP
Thin archives are also \fIflattened\fR, so that adding one thin
archive to another thin archive does not nest it, as would happen with
a normal archive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are added
individually to the second archive.
.PP
The paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to the
archive itself.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR is designed to be compatible with two different
facilities.  You can control its activity using command-line options,
like the different varieties of \fBar\fR on Unix systems; or, if you
specify the single command-line option \fB\-M\fR, you can control it
with a script supplied via standard input, like the \s-1MRI\s0 \*(L"librarian\*(R"
program.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR allows you to mix the operation code \fIp\fR and modifier
flags \fImod\fR in any order, within the first command-line argument.
.PP
If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
dash.
.PP
The \fIp\fR keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be
any of the following, but you must specify only one of them:
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
\&\fIDelete\fR modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
be deleted as \fImember\fR...; the archive is untouched if you
specify no files to delete.
.Sp
If you specify the \fBv\fR modifier, \fBar\fR lists each module
as it is deleted.
.IP "\fBm\fR" 4
.IX Item "m"
Use this operation to \fImove\fR members in an archive.
.Sp
The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in more
than one member.
.Sp
If no modifiers are used with \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR, any members you name in the
\&\fImember\fR arguments are moved to the \fIend\fR of the archive;
you can use the \fBa\fR, \fBb\fR, or \fBi\fR modifiers to move them to a
specified place instead.
.IP "\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "p"
\&\fIPrint\fR the specified members of the archive, to the standard
output file.  If the \fBv\fR modifier is specified, show the member
name before copying its contents to standard output.
.Sp
If you specify no \fImember\fR arguments, all the files in the archive are
printed.
.IP "\fBq\fR" 4
.IX Item "q"
\&\fIQuick append\fR; Historically, add the files \fImember\fR... to the end of
\&\fIarchive\fR, without checking for replacement.
.Sp
The modifiers \fBa\fR, \fBb\fR, and \fBi\fR do \fInot\fR affect this
operation; new members are always placed at the end of the archive.
.Sp
The modifier \fBv\fR makes \fBar\fR list each file as it is appended.
.Sp
Since the point of this operation is speed, implementations of
\&\fBar\fR have the option of not updating the archive's symbol
table if one exists.  Too many different systems however assume that
symbol tables are always up-to-date, so \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR will
rebuild the table even with a quick append.
.Sp
Note \- \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR treats the command \fBqs\fR as a
synonym for \fBr\fR \- replacing already existing files in the
archive and appending new ones at the end.
.IP "\fBr\fR" 4
.IX Item "r"
Insert the files \fImember\fR... into \fIarchive\fR (with
\&\fIreplacement\fR). This operation differs from \fBq\fR in that any
previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being
added.
.Sp
If one of the files named in \fImember\fR... does not exist, \fBar\fR
displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing members
of the archive matching that name.
.Sp
By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may
use one of the modifiers \fBa\fR, \fBb\fR, or \fBi\fR to request
placement relative to some existing member.
.Sp
The modifier \fBv\fR used with this operation elicits a line of
output for each file inserted, along with one of the letters \fBa\fR or
\&\fBr\fR to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member
deleted) or replaced.
.IP "\fBs\fR" 4
.IX Item "s"
Add an index to the archive, or update it if it already exists.  Note
this command is an exception to the rule that there can only be one
command letter, as it is possible to use it as either a command or a
modifier.  In either case it does the same thing.
.IP "\fBt\fR" 4
.IX Item "t"
Display a \fItable\fR listing the contents of \fIarchive\fR, or those
of the files listed in \fImember\fR... that are present in the
archive.  Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to
see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can
request that by also specifying the \fBv\fR modifier.
.Sp
If you do not specify a \fImember\fR, all files in the archive
are listed.
.Sp
If there is more than one file with the same name (say, \fBfie\fR) in
an archive (say \fBb.a\fR), \fBar t b.a fie\fR lists only the
first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
listing\-\-\-in our example, \fBar t b.a\fR.
.IP "\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "x"
\&\fIExtract\fR members (named \fImember\fR) from the archive.  You can
use the \fBv\fR modifier with this operation, to request that
\&\fBar\fR list each name as it extracts it.
.Sp
If you do not specify a \fImember\fR, all files in the archive
are extracted.
.Sp
Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Displays the list of command line options supported by \fBar\fR
and then exits.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Displays the version information of \fBar\fR and then exits.
.PP
A number of modifiers (\fImod\fR) may immediately follow the \fIp\fR
keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior:
.IP "\fBa\fR" 4
.IX Item "a"
Add new files \fIafter\fR an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier \fBa\fR, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the \fIrelpos\fR argument, before the
\&\fIarchive\fR specification.
.IP "\fBb\fR" 4
.IX Item "b"
Add new files \fIbefore\fR an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier \fBb\fR, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the \fIrelpos\fR argument, before the
\&\fIarchive\fR specification.  (same as \fBi\fR).
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
\&\fICreate\fR the archive.  The specified \fIarchive\fR is always
created if it did not exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by
using this modifier.
.IP "\fBD\fR" 4
.IX Item "D"
Operate in \fIdeterministic\fR mode.  When adding files and the archive
index use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and use consistent file modes
for all files.  When this option is used, if \fBar\fR is used with
identical options and identical input files, multiple runs will create
identical output files regardless of the input files' owners, groups,
file modes, or modification times.
.Sp
If \fIbinutils\fR was configured with
\&\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR, then this mode is on by default.
It can be disabled with the \fBU\fR modifier, below.
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Truncate names in the archive.  \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR will normally permit file
names of any length.  This will cause it to create archives which are
not compatible with the native \fBar\fR program on some systems.  If
this is a concern, the \fBf\fR modifier may be used to truncate file
names when putting them in the archive.
.IP "\fBi\fR" 4
.IX Item "i"
Insert new files \fIbefore\fR an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier \fBi\fR, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the \fIrelpos\fR argument, before the
\&\fIarchive\fR specification.  (same as \fBb\fR).
.IP "\fBl\fR" 4
.IX Item "l"
This modifier is accepted but not used.
.IP "\fBN\fR" 4
.IX Item "N"
Uses the \fIcount\fR parameter.  This is used if there are multiple
entries in the archive with the same name.  Extract or delete instance
\&\fIcount\fR of the given name from the archive.
.IP "\fBo\fR" 4
.IX Item "o"
Preserve the \fIoriginal\fR dates of members when extracting them.  If
you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
are stamped with the time of extraction.
.IP "\fBP\fR" 4
.IX Item "P"
Use the full path name when matching names in the archive.  \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBar\fR can not create an archive with a full path name (such archives
are not \s-1POSIX\s0 complaint), but other archive creators can.  This option
will cause \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR to match file names using a complete path
name, which can be convenient when extracting a single file from an
archive created by another tool.
.IP "\fBs\fR" 4
.IX Item "s"
Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one,
even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use this modifier
flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running \fBar s\fR on an
archive is equivalent to running \fBranlib\fR on it.
.IP "\fBS\fR" 4
.IX Item "S"
Do not generate an archive symbol table.  This can speed up building a
large library in several steps.  The resulting archive can not be used
with the linker.  In order to build a symbol table, you must omit the
\&\fBS\fR modifier on the last execution of \fBar\fR, or you must run
\&\fBranlib\fR on the archive.
.IP "\fBT\fR" 4
.IX Item "T"
Make the specified \fIarchive\fR a \fIthin\fR archive.  If it already
exists and is a regular archive, the existing members must be present
in the same directory as \fIarchive\fR.
.IP "\fBu\fR" 4
.IX Item "u"
Normally, \fBar r\fR... inserts all files
listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert \fIonly\fR those
of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same
names, use this modifier.  The \fBu\fR modifier is allowed only for the
operation \fBr\fR (replace).  In particular, the combination \fBqu\fR is
not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed
advantage from the operation \fBq\fR.
.IP "\fBU\fR" 4
.IX Item "U"
Do \fInot\fR operate in \fIdeterministic\fR mode.  This is the inverse
of the \fBD\fR modifier, above: added files and the archive index will
get their actual \s-1UID\s0, \s-1GID\s0, timestamp, and file mode values.
.Sp
This is the default unless \fIbinutils\fR was configured with
\&\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
This modifier requests the \fIverbose\fR version of an operation.  Many
operations display additional information, such as filenames processed,
when the modifier \fBv\fR is appended.
.IP "\fBV\fR" 4
.IX Item "V"
This modifier shows the version number of \fBar\fR.
.PP
\&\fBar\fR ignores an initial option spelt \fB\-X32_64\fR, for
compatibility with \s-1AIX\s0.  The behaviour produced by this option is the
default for \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR.  \fBar\fR does not support any of the other
\&\fB\-X\fR options; in particular, it does not support \fB\-X32\fR
which is the default for \s-1AIX\s0 \fBar\fR.
.PP
The optional command line switch \fB\-\-plugin\fR \fIname\fR causes
\&\fBar\fR to load the plugin called \fIname\fR which adds support
for more file formats.  This option is only available if the toolchain
has been built with plugin support enabled.
.PP
The optional command line switch \fB\-\-target\fR \fIbfdname\fR
specifies that the archive members are in an object code format
different from your system's default format.  See
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.PK
     ŠcOÛ³ß?      	   1/1.z2202  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBas\fR is really a family of assemblers.
If you use (or have used) the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
\&\fIpseudo-ops\fR) and assembler syntax.
.PP
\&\fBas\fR is primarily intended to assemble the output of the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 C compiler \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C'\fR for use by the linker
\&\f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make \fBas\fR
assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.
Any exceptions are documented explicitly.
This doesn't mean \fBas\fR always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.
.PP
Each time you run \fBas\fR it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)
.PP
You give \fBas\fR a command line that has zero or more input file
names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A
command line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning
is taken to be an input file name.
.PP
If you give \fBas\fR no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the \fBas\fR standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type \fBctl-D\fR to tell \fBas\fR there is no more program
to assemble.
.PP
Use \fB\-\-\fR if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.
.PP
If the source is empty, \fBas\fR produces a small, empty object
file.
.PP
\&\fBas\fR may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler
runs \fBas\fR automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so
that \fBas\fR could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
grave problem that stops the assembly.
.PP
If you are invoking \fBas\fR via the \s-1GNU\s0 C compiler,
you can use the \fB\-Wa\fR option to pass arguments through to the assembler.
The assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the \fB\-Wa\fR)
by commas.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-c \-g \-O \-Wa,\-alh,\-L file.c
.Ve
.PP
This passes two options to the assembler: \fB\-alh\fR (emit a listing to
standard output with high-level and assembly source) and \fB\-L\fR (retain
local symbols in the symbol table).
.PP
Usually you do not need to use this \fB\-Wa\fR mechanism, since many compiler
command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler by the compiler.
(You can call the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler driver with the \fB\-v\fR option to see
precisely what options it passes to each compilation pass, including the
assembler.)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.IP "\fB\-a[cdghlmns]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a[cdghlmns]"
Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-ac\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ac"
omit false conditionals
.IP "\fB\-ad\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ad"
omit debugging directives
.IP "\fB\-ag\fR" 4

This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will issue an error
message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction which will not execute
on the target processor.  The following processor names are recognized:
\&\f(CW\*(C`cortex\-a53\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`cortex\-a57\*(C'\fR,
and
\&\f(CW\*(C`xgene\-1\*(C'\fR.
The special name \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR may be used to allow the assembler to accept
instructions valid for any supported processor, including all optional
extensions.
.Sp
In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to
accept, or restrict, various extension mnemonics that extend the
processor.
.Sp
If some implementations of a particular processor can have an
extension, then then those extensions are automatically enabled.
Consequently, you will not normally have to specify any additional
extensions.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIarchitecture\fR\fB[+\fR\fIextension\fR\fB...]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=architecture[+extension...]"
This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler will
issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an
instruction which will not execute on the target architecture.  The
only value for \fIarchitecture\fR is \f(CW\*(C`armv8\-a\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If both \fB\-mcpu\fR and \fB\-march\fR are specified, the
assembler will use the setting for \fB\-mcpu\fR.  If neither are
specified, the assembler will default to \fB\-mcpu=all\fR.

The architecture option can be extended with the same instruction set
extension options as the \fB\-mcpu\fR option.  Unlike
\&\fB\-mcpu\fR, extensions are not always enabled by default,
.IP "\fB\-mverbose\-error\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-m\fR\fIcpu\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu"
This option specifies the target processor.  If an attempt is made to

In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to
accept various extension mnemonics.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-march=i686+sse4+vmx\*(C'\fR extends \fIi686\fR with \fIsse4\fR and

The \fB\-mdsbt\fR option causes the assembler to generate the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Tag_ABI_DSBT\*(C'\fR attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the
code is using \s-1DSBT\s0 addressing.  The \fB\-mno\-dsbt\fR option, the
default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that the code
does not use \s-1DSBT\s0 addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if
objects of different type (\s-1DSBT\s0 and non-DSBT) are linked together.

\&\f(CW\*(C`Tag_ABI_PID\*(C'\fR attribute with a value indicating the form of data
addressing used by the code.  \fB\-mpid=no\fR, the default,
indicates position-dependent data addressing, \fB\-mpid=near\fR
indicates position-independent addressing with \s-1GOT\s0 accesses using near
\&\s-1DP\s0 addressing, and \fB\-mpid=far\fR indicates position-independent

Xtensa processor.
.IP "\fB\-\-text\-section\-literals | \-\-no\-text\-section\-literals\fR" 4
.IX Item "--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals"
Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
\&\fB\-\-no\-text\-section\-literals\fR, which places literals in
separate sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
placed in a data \s-1RAM/ROM\s0.  With \fB\-\-text\-section\-literals\fR, the
literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as
close as possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large
assembly files, where the literals would otherwise be out of range of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR instructions in the text section.  These options only affect
literals referenced via PC-relative \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR instructions; literals
for absolute mode \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR instructions are handled separately.
.IP "\fB\-\-absolute\-literals | \-\-no\-absolute\-literals\fR" 4
.IX Item "--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals"
Indicate to the assembler whether \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR instructions use absolute
or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute
addressing option, the default is to use absolute \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR
relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR relocations
can be used.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-align | \-\-no\-target\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-align | --no-target-align"
Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties at some
expense in code size.    This optimization is enabled by default.  Note
that the assembler will always align instructions like \f(CW\*(C`LOOP\*(C'\fR that
have fixed alignment requirements.
.IP "\fB\-\-longcalls | \-\-no\-longcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "--longcalls | --no-longcalls"
Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow calls
across a greater range of addresses.    This option should be used when call
targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade both code size
and performance, but the linker can generally optimize away the
unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within range.  The default is
\&\fB\-\-no\-longcalls\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-transform | \-\-no\-transform\fR" 4
.IX Item "--transform | --no-transform"
Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa instructions,
including both relaxation and optimization.  The default is
\&\fB\-\-transform\fR; \fB\-\-no\-transform\fR should only be used in the
rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified in the
assembly source.  Using \fB\-\-no\-transform\fR causes out of range
instruction operands to be errors.
.IP "\fB\-\-rename\-section\fR \fIoldname\fR\fB=\fR\fInewname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--rename-section oldname=newname"
Rename the \fIoldname\fR section to \fInewname\fR.  This option can be used
multiple times to rename multiple sections.
.IP "\fB\-\-trampolines | \-\-no\-trampolines\fR" 4
.IX Item "--trampolines | --no-trampolines"
Enable or disable transformation of jump instructions to allow jumps
across a greater range of addresses.    This option should be used when jump targets can
potentially be out of range.  In the absence of such jumps this option
does not affect code size or performance.  The default is
\&\fB\-\-trampolines\fR.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \*(C+ and Java languages provide function overloading, which means
that you can write many functions with the same name, providing that
each function takes parameters of different types.  In order to be
able to distinguish these similarly named functions \*(C+ and Java
encode them into a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies
each different version.  This process is known as \fImangling\fR. The
\&\fBc++filt\fR
[1]
program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (\fIdemangles\fR) low-level
names into user-level names so that they can be read.
.PP
Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,
dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential mangled name.
If the name decodes into a \*(C+ name, the \*(C+ name replaces the
low-level name in the output, otherwise the original word is output.
In this way you can pass an entire assembler source file, containing
mangled names, through \fBc++filt\fR and see the same source file
containing demangled names.
.PP
You can also use \fBc++filt\fR to decipher individual symbols by
passing them on the command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        c++filt <symbol>
.Ve
.PP
If no \fIsymbol\fR arguments are given, \fBc++filt\fR reads symbol
names from the standard input instead.  All the results are printed on
the standard output.  The difference between reading names from the
command line versus reading names from the standard input is that
command line arguments are expected to be just mangled names and no
checking is performed to separate them from surrounding text.  Thus
for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        c++filt \-n _Z1fv
.Ve
.PP
will work and demangle the name to \*(L"f()\*(R" whereas:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        c++filt \-n _Z1fv,
.Ve
.PP
will not work.  (Note the extra comma at the end of the mangled
name which makes it invalid).  This command however will work:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        echo _Z1fv, | c++filt \-n
.Ve
.PP
and will display \*(L"f(),\*(R", i.e., the demangled name followed by a
trailing comma.  This behaviour is because when the names are read
from the standard input it is expected that they might be part of an
assembler source file where there might be extra, extraneous
characters trailing after a mangled name.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&            .type   _Z1fv, @function
.Ve

On some systems, both the C and \*(C+ compilers put an underscore in front
of every name.  For example, the C name \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR gets the low-level
name \f(CW\*(C`_foo\*(C'\fR.  This option removes the initial underscore.  Whether
\&\fBc++filt\fR removes the underscore by default is target dependent.

the compiler, and they can be confused with non-mangled names.  For example,
a function called \*(L"a\*(R" treated as a mangled type name would be
demangled to \*(L"signed char\*(R".

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The C preprocessor, often known as \fIcpp\fR, is a \fImacro processor\fR
that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program
before compilation.  It is called a macro processor because it allows
you to define \fImacros\fR, which are brief abbreviations for longer
constructs.
.PP
The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, \*(C+, and
Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general
text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of
character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it
preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
C\-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.
.PP
Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
(Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  \fB\-traditional\-cpp\fR
mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many
of the problems can be avoided by writing C or \*(C+ style comments
instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.
.PP
Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
you are writing in.  Modern versions of the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler have macro
facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,
try a true general text processor, such as \s-1GNU M4.\s0
.PP
C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the \s-1GNU C\s0
preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of \s-1ISO\s0
Standard C.  In its default mode, the \s-1GNU C\s0 preprocessor does not do a
few things required by the standard.  These are features which are
rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning
of a program which does not expect them.  To get strict \s-1ISO\s0 Standard C,
you should use the \fB\-std=c90\fR, \fB\-std=c99\fR or
\&\fB\-std=c11\fR options, depending
on which version of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatory
diagnostics, you must also use \fB\-pedantic\fR.
.PP
This manual describes the behavior of the \s-1ISO\s0 preprocessor.  To
minimize gratuitous differences, where the \s-1ISO\s0 preprocessor's
behavior does not conflict with traditional semantics, the
traditional preprocessor should behave the same way.  The various
differences that do exist are detailed in the section \fBTraditional
Mode\fR.
.PP
For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to \fB\s-1CPP\s0\fR in this
manual refer to \s-1GNU CPP.\s0
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, \fIinfile\fR and
\&\fIoutfile\fR.  The preprocessor reads \fIinfile\fR together with any
other files it specifies with \fB#include\fR.  All the output generated
by the combined input files is written in \fIoutfile\fR.
.PP
Either \fIinfile\fR or \fIoutfile\fR may be \fB\-\fR, which as
\&\fIinfile\fR means to read from standard input and as \fIoutfile\fR
means to write to standard output.  Also, if either file is omitted, it
means the same as if \fB\-\fR had been specified for that file.
.PP
Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in \fB=\fR, all options
which take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately
after the option, or with a space between option and argument:
\&\fB\-Ifoo\fR and \fB\-I foo\fR have the same effect.
.PP
Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dM\fR is very different from
\&\fB\-d\ \-M\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \f(CW1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name=definition"
The contents of \fIdefinition\fR are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a \fB#define\fR
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.
.Sp
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With \fBsh\fR and \fBcsh\fR,
\&\fB\-D'\fR\fIname\fR\fB(\fR\fIargs...\fR\fB)=\fR\fIdefinition\fR\fB'\fR works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR and
\&\fB\-include\fR \fIfile\fR options are processed after all
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Cancel any previous definition of \fIname\fR, either built in or
provided with a \fB\-D\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I dir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
.Sp
Directories named by \fB\-I\fR are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory \fIdir\fR is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
\&.
If \fIdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Write output to \fIfile\fR.  This is the same as specifying \fIfile\fR
as the second non-option argument to \fBcpp\fR.  \fBgcc\fR has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use \fB\-o\fR to specify the output file.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is \fB\-Wcomment\fR, \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR,
\&\fB\-Wmultichar\fR and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in \f(CW\*(C`#if\*(C'\fR expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
.IP "\fB\-Wcomment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomment"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wcomments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wcomments"
.PD
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a \fB//\fR comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (\fB??/\fR at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  If \fB\-Wall\fR is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
\&\fB\-Wall\fR warnings, use \fB\-trigraphs \-Wall \-Wno\-trigraphs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO C. \s0 Also warn about \s-1ISO C\s0 constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
.IP "\fB\-Wundef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wundef"
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
\&\fB#if\fR directive, outside of \fBdefined\fR.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-macros"
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is \fIused\fR if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
.Sp
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then \s-1CPP\s0 will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
\&        #endif
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wendif\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wendif-labels"
Warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        #if FOO
\&        ...
\&        #else FOO
\&        ...
\&        #endif FOO
.Ve
.Sp
The second and third \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:

.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp

.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.

Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:

extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
.Sp
The option's behavior depends on the \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR
options.
.Sp
With \fB\-E\fR, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`#ifdef\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`#error\*(C'\fR.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the \fB\-dD\fR option is
implicitly enabled.
.Sp
With \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_LINE_\|_\*(C'\fR, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
With both \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, the rules for
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of

When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.
.IP "\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions \fB.i\fR, \fB.ii\fR or \fB.mi\fR.  These are the
extensions that \s-1GCC\s0 uses for preprocessed files created by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.

This option is only useful for debugging \s-1GCC. \s0 When used with

When used without \fB\-E\fR, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR[\fB=\fR\fIlevel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]"
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The \fIlevel\fR parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value \fB0\fR of \fIlevel\fR de-activates
this option just as if no \fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR was present
on the command line. Value \fB1\fR tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value \fB2\fR tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
\&\fB2\fR.

\&\fB\-fexec\-charset\fR, \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding supported
by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-finput\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finput-charset=charset"
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by \s-1GCC. \s0 If the
locale does not specify, or \s-1GCC\s0 cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding
supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives are emitted whatsoever.

Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.
.IP "\fB\-CC\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CC"
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is

also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
.Sp
In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C\-style comments.  This is to prevent later use

Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBdlltool\fR reads its inputs, which can come from the \fB\-d\fR and
\&\fB\-b\fR options as well as object files specified on the command
line.  It then processes these inputs and if the \fB\-e\fR option has
been specified it creates a exports file.  If the \fB\-l\fR option
has been specified it creates a library file and if the \fB\-z\fR option
has been specified it creates a def file.  Any or all of the \fB\-e\fR,
\&\fB\-l\fR and \fB\-z\fR options can be present in one invocation of
dlltool.
.PP
When creating a \s-1DLL\s0, along with the source for the \s-1DLL\s0, it is necessary
to have three other files.  \fBdlltool\fR can help with the creation of
these files.
.PP
The first file is a \fI.def\fR file which specifies which functions are
exported from the \s-1DLL\s0, which functions the \s-1DLL\s0 imports, and so on.  This
is a text file and can be created by hand, or \fBdlltool\fR can be used
to create it using the \fB\-z\fR option.  In this case \fBdlltool\fR
will scan the object files specified on its command line looking for
those functions which have been specially marked as being exported and
put entries for them in the \fI.def\fR file it creates.
.PP
In order to mark a function as being exported from a \s-1DLL\s0, it needs to
have an \fB\-export:<name_of_function>\fR entry in the \fB.drectve\fR
section of the object file.  This can be done in C by using the
\&\fIasm()\fR operator:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&          asm (".section .drectve");
\&          asm (".ascii \e"\-export:my_func\e"");
\&        
\&          int my_func (void) { ... }
.Ve
.PP
The second file needed for \s-1DLL\s0 creation is an exports file.  This file
is linked with the object files that make up the body of the \s-1DLL\s0 and it
handles the interface between the \s-1DLL\s0 and the outside world.  This is a
binary file and it can be created by giving the \fB\-e\fR option to
\&\fBdlltool\fR when it is creating or reading in a \fI.def\fR file.
.PP
The third file needed for \s-1DLL\s0 creation is the library file that programs
will link with in order to access the functions in the \s-1DLL\s0 (an `import
library').  This file can be created by giving the \fB\-l\fR option to
dlltool when it is creating or reading in a \fI.def\fR file.
.PP
If the \fB\-y\fR option is specified, dlltool generates a delay-import
library that can be used instead of the normal import library to allow
a program to link to the dll only as soon as an imported function is
called for the first time. The resulting executable will need to be
linked to the static delayimp library containing _\|\fI_delayLoadHelper2()\fR,
which in turn will import LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress from kernel32.
.PP
\&\fBdlltool\fR builds the library file by hand, but it builds the
exports file by creating temporary files containing assembler statements
and then assembling these.  The \fB\-S\fR command line option can be
used to specify the path to the assembler that dlltool will use,
and the \fB\-f\fR option can be used to pass specific flags to that
assembler.  The \fB\-n\fR can be used to prevent dlltool from deleting
these temporary assembler files when it is done, and if \fB\-n\fR is
specified twice then this will prevent dlltool from deleting the
temporary object files it used to build the library.
.PP
Here is an example of creating a \s-1DLL\s0 from a source file \fBdll.c\fR and
also creating a program (from an object file called \fBprogram.o\fR)
that uses that \s-1DLL:\s0
.PP
.Vb 4
\&          gcc \-c dll.c
\&          dlltool \-e exports.o \-l dll.lib dll.o
\&          gcc dll.o exports.o \-o dll.dll
\&          gcc program.o dll.lib \-o program
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBdlltool\fR may also be used to query an existing import library
to determine the name of the \s-1DLL\s0 to which it is associated.  See the
description of the \fB\-I\fR or \fB\-\-identify\fR option.

.IX Item "-l filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-lib\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-y\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-y filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-delaylib\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-delaylib filename"
.PD
Specifies the name of the delay-import library file to be created by dlltool.
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-all-symbols"
Treat all global and weak defined symbols found in the input object
files as symbols to be exported.  There is a small list of symbols which
are not exported by default; see the \fB\-\-no\-default\-excludes\fR
option.  You may add to the list of symbols to not export by using the
\&\fB\-\-exclude\-symbols\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-export\-all\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-export-all-symbols"
Only export symbols explicitly listed in an input \fI.def\fR file or in
\&\fB.drectve\fR sections in the input object files.  This is the default
behaviour.  The \fB.drectve\fR sections are created by \fBdllexport\fR
attributes in the source code.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-symbols\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-symbols list"
Do not export the symbols in \fIlist\fR.  This is a list of symbol names
separated by comma or colon characters.  The symbol names should not
contain a leading underscore.  This is only meaningful when
\&\fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-default\-excludes\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-default-excludes"
When \fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR is used, it will by default avoid
exporting certain special symbols.  The current list of symbols to avoid
exporting is \fBDllMain@12\fR, \fBDllEntryPoint@0\fR,
\&\fBimpure_ptr\fR.  You may use the \fB\-\-no\-default\-excludes\fR option
to go ahead and export these special symbols.  This is only meaningful
when \fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR \fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S path"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-as\fR \fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--as path"
.PD
Specifies the path, including the filename, of the assembler to be used
to create the exports file.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIoptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f options"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-as\-flags\fR \fIoptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "--as-flags options"
.PD
Specifies any specific command line options to be passed to the
assembler when building the exports file.  This option will work even if
the \fB\-S\fR option is not used.  This option only takes one argument,
and if it occurs more than once on the command line, then later
occurrences will override earlier occurrences.  So if it is necessary to
pass multiple options to the assembler they should be enclosed in
double quotes.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-dll\-name\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dll-name name"
.PD
Specifies the name to be stored in the \fI.def\fR file as the name of
the \s-1DLL\s0 when the \fB\-e\fR option is used.  If this option is not
present, then the filename given to the \fB\-e\fR option will be
used as the name of the \s-1DLL\s0.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m machine"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-machine\fR \fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-machine machine"
.PD
Specifies the type of machine for which the library file should be
built.  \fBdlltool\fR has a built in default type, depending upon how
it was created, but this option can be used to override that.  This is
normally only useful when creating DLLs for an \s-1ARM\s0 processor, when the
contents of the \s-1DLL\s0 are actually encode using Thumb instructions.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-add\-indirect\fR" 4
.IX Item "--add-indirect"
.PD
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports file it
should add a section which allows the exported functions to be
referenced without using the import library.  Whatever the hell that
means!
.IP "\fB\-U\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-add\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "--add-underscore"
.PD
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports file it
should prepend an underscore to the names of \fIall\fR exported symbols.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-leading\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-leading-underscore"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-leading\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "--leading-underscore"
.PD
Specifies whether standard symbol should be forced to be prefixed, or
not.
.IP "\fB\-\-add\-stdcall\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "--add-stdcall-underscore"
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports file it
should prepend an underscore to the names of exported \fIstdcall\fR
functions. Variable names and non-stdcall function names are not modified.
This option is useful when creating GNU-compatible import libs for third
party DLLs that were built with MS-Windows tools.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-kill\-at\fR" 4
.IX Item "--kill-at"
.PD
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports file it
should not append the string \fB@ <number>\fR.  These numbers are
called ordinal numbers and they represent another way of accessing the
function in a \s-1DLL\s0, other than by name.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-add\-stdcall\-alias\fR" 4
.IX Item "--add-stdcall-alias"
.PD
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports file it
should add aliases for stdcall symbols without \fB@ <number>\fR
in addition to the symbols with \fB@ <number>\fR.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-ext\-prefix\-alias\fR \fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ext-prefix-alias prefix"
.PD
Causes \fBdlltool\fR to create external aliases for all \s-1DLL\s0
imports with the specified prefix.  The aliases are created for both
external and import symbols with no leading underscore.
.IP "\fB\-x\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-idata4\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-idata4"
.PD
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports and library
files it should omit the \f(CW\*(C`.idata4\*(C'\fR section.  This is for compatibility
with certain operating systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-use\-nul\-prefixed\-import\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "--use-nul-prefixed-import-tables"
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports and library
files it should prefix the \f(CW\*(C`.idata4\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.idata5\*(C'\fR by zero an
element. This emulates old gnu import library generation of
\&\f(CW\*(C`dlltool\*(C'\fR. By default this option is turned off.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-idata5\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-idata5"
.PD
Specifies that when \fBdlltool\fR is creating the exports and library
files it should omit the \f(CW\*(C`.idata5\*(C'\fR section.  This is for compatibility
with certain operating systems.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-identify\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4

Specifies that \fBdlltool\fR should inspect the import library
indicated by \fIfilename\fR and report, on \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR, the name(s)
of the associated \s-1DLL\s0(s).  This can be performed in addition to any
other operations indicated by the other options and arguments.
\&\fBdlltool\fR fails if the import library does not exist or is not
actually an import library. See also \fB\-\-identify\-strict\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-identify\-strict\fR" 4
.IX Item "--identify-strict"
Modifies the behavior of the \fB\-\-identify\fR option, such
that an error is reported if \fIfilename\fR is associated with
more than one \s-1DLL\s0.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-interwork\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-nodelete\fR" 4
.IX Item "--nodelete"
.PD
Makes \fBdlltool\fR preserve the temporary assembler files it used to
create the exports file.  If this option is repeated then dlltool will
also preserve the temporary object files it uses to create the library
file.

Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC,\s0 it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The \*(L"overall options\*(R" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command-line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dv\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-v\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the \fB\-l\fR option is significant.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example,
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

.SS "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

You can specify the input language explicitly with the \fB\-x\fR option:
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x language"
Specify explicitly the \fIlanguage\fR for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next \fB\-x\fR option.  Possible values for \fIlanguage\fR are:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        c  c\-header  cpp\-output
\&        c++  c++\-header  c++\-cpp\-output
\&        objective\-c  objective\-c\-header  objective\-c\-cpp\-output

\&        go
\&        java
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-x none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x none"
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if \fB\-x\fR
has not been used at all).
.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, \*(C+, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
.Sp
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, etc., with \fB.s\fR.
.Sp
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
.Sp
Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Place output in file \fIfile\fR.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
.Sp
If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI.gch\fR, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4
.IX Item "-###"
Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or \f(CW\*(C`./\-_\*(C'\fR.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.
.IP "\fB\-pipe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pipe"

various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler has
no trouble.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by \fBgcc\fR.  If the \fB\-v\fR option is also specified
then \fB\-\-help\fR is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by \fBgcc\fR, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the \fB\-Wextra\fR option has also been specified
(prior to the \fB\-\-help\fR option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific

.IP "\fB\-\-help={\fR\fIclass\fR|[\fB^\fR]\fIqualifier\fR\fB}\fR[\fB,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...]"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimizers\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimizers"
Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
.IP "\fBwarnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "warnings"
Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
.IP "\fBtarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "target"
Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
\&\fB\-\-target\-help\fR option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended \fB\-\-help=\fR syntax.
.IP "\fBparams\fR" 4
.IX Item "params"
Display the values recognized by the \fB\-\-param\fR
option.
.IP "\fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "language"
Display the options supported for \fIlanguage\fR, where
\&\fIlanguage\fR is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fBcommon\fR" 4
.IX Item "common"
Display the options that are common to all languages.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
These are the supported qualifiers:
.IP "\fBundocumented\fR" 4
.IX Item "undocumented"
Display only those options that are undocumented.
.IP "\fBjoined\fR" 4
.IX Item "joined"
Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
\&\fB\-\-help=target\fR.
.IP "\fBseparate\fR" 4
.IX Item "separate"
Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: \fB\-o output-file\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
\&\fB^\fR character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The argument to \fB\-\-help=\fR should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.
.Sp
Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
\&\fItarget\fR.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-\-help=\fR option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.
.Sp
If the \fB\-Q\fR option appears on the command line before the
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR option, then the descriptive text displayed by
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the \fB\-\-help=\fR option is used).
.Sp
Here is a truncated example from the \s-1ARM\s0 port of \fBgcc\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&          % gcc \-Q \-mabi=2 \-\-help=target \-c
\&          The following options are target specific:
\&          \-mabi=                                2
\&          \-mabort\-on\-noreturn                   [disabled]
\&          \-mapcs                                [disabled]
.Ve
.Sp
The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at \fB\-O2\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by \fB\-O3\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O3 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O3\-opts
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O2\-opts
\&        diff /tmp/O2\-opts /tmp/O3\-opts | grep enabled
.Ve
.RE

.Sp
.Vb 1

.IP "\fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIname\fR\fB.so\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fplugin=name.so"
Load the plugin code in file \fIname\fR.so, assumed to be a

the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
purposes of argument parsing (See
\&\fB\-fplugin\-arg\-\fR\fIname\fR\fB\-\fR\fIkey\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR below).

useful way to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.SS "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR, \fB.hpp\fR,
\&\fB.H\fR, or (for shared template code) \fB.tcc\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, the use of \fBgcc\fR does not add the \*(C+ library.
\&\fBg++\fR is a program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 and automatically specifies linking
against the \*(C+ library.  It treats \fB.c\fR,
\&\fB.h\fR and \fB.i\fR files as \*(C+ source files instead of C source
files unless \fB\-x\fR is used.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a \fB.h\fR extension for use in \*(C+
compilations.  On many systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with
the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.
.SS "Options Controlling C Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling C Dialect"
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+) that the compiler
accepts:
.IP "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, this is equivalent to \fB\-std=c90\fR. In \*(C+ mode, it is
equivalent to \fB\-std=c++98\fR.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO
C90 \s0(when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO C\s0 program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-Wpedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO C \s0(such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in
functions when \fB\-ansi\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-std=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-std="
Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or \*(C+.
.Sp
The compiler can accept several base standards, such as \fBc90\fR or
\&\fBc++98\fR, and \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of those standards, such as
\&\fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu++98\fR.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
\&\fB\-std=c90\fR turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are
incompatible with \s-1ISO C90,\s0 such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR
keywords, but not other \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not have a meaning in
\&\s-1ISO C90,\s0 such as omitting the middle term of a \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR
expression. On the other hand, when a \s-1GNU\s0 dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to identify which features are \s-1GNU\s0
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
\&\fB\-std=gnu90 \-Wpedantic\fR warns about \*(C+ style \fB//\fR
comments, while \fB\-std=gnu99 \-Wpedantic\fR does not.

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is

.IP "\fB\-fhosted\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fhosted"
Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies
\&\fB\-fbuiltin\fR.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR has a return
type of \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-freestanding\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffreestanding\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffreestanding"
Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
implies \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  The most obvious example is an \s-1OS\s0 kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-hosted\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fopenmp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fopenmp"
Enable handling of OpenMP directives \f(CW\*(C`#pragma omp\*(C'\fR in C/\*(C+ and
\&\f(CW\*(C`!$omp\*(C'\fR in Fortran.  When \fB\-fopenmp\fR is specified, the
compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v4.0 <\fBhttp://www.openmp.org/\fR>.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for \fB\-pthread\fR. \fB\-fopenmp\fR implies
\&\fB\-fopenmp\-simd\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fopenmp\-simd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fopenmp-simd"
Enable handling of OpenMP's \s-1SIMD\s0 directives with \f(CW\*(C`#pragma omp\*(C'\fR
in C/\*(C+ and \f(CW\*(C`!$omp\*(C'\fR in Fortran. Other OpenMP directives
are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-fcilkplus\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcilkplus"
Enable the usage of Cilk Plus language extension features for C/\*(C+.
When the option \fB\-fcilkplus\fR is specified, enable the usage of
the Cilk Plus Language extension features for C/\*(C+.  The present
implementation follows \s-1ABI\s0 version 1.2.  This is an experimental
feature that is only partially complete, and whose interface may
change in future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 as the official specification
changes.  Currently, all features but \f(CW\*(C`_Cilk_for\*(C'\fR have been
implemented.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-tm"
When the option \fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR is specified, the compiler
generates code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional
Memory \s-1ABI\s0 specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is
an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions
of \s-1GCC,\s0 as the official specification changes.  Please note that not
all architectures are supported for this feature.
.Sp
For more information on \s-1GCC\s0's support for transactional memory,

non-call exceptions (\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR).
.IP "\fB\-fms\-extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fms-extensions"
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

In \*(C+ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar

.Sp
.Vb 4

Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.

Note that this option is off for all targets but i?86 and x86_64
targets using ms-abi.
.IP "\fB\-fplan9\-extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fplan9-extensions"
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.
.Sp
This enables \fB\-fms\-extensions\fR, permits passing pointers to
structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers to
elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous
fields declared using a typedef.    This is only
supported for C, not \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-trigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-trigraphs"
Support \s-1ISO C\s0 trigraphs.  The \fB\-ansi\fR option (and \fB\-std\fR
options for strict \s-1ISO C\s0 conformance) implies \fB\-trigraphs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-traditional\fR" 4
.IX Item "-traditional"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-traditional\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-traditional-cpp"
.PD
Formerly, these options caused \s-1GCC\s0 to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the \fB\-E\fR switch.
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the \s-1GNU
CPP\s0 manual for details.
.IP "\fB\-fcond\-mismatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcond-mismatch"
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-flax\-vector\-conversions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flax-vector-conversions"
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.
.IP "\fB\-funsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
.IP "\fB\-fsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be signed, like \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Note that this is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-unsigned\-char\fR, which is
the negative form of \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.  Likewise, the option
\&\fB\-fno\-signed\-char\fR is equivalent to \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.

.PD
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either \f(CW\*(C`signed\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned\*(C'\fR.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR are signed types.
.SS "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`firstClass.C\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        g++ \-g \-frepo \-O \-c firstClass.C
.Ve
.PP
In this example, only \fB\-frepo\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC.\s0
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI. \s0 The default is version 2.
.Sp
Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.  Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs are fixed.
.Sp
Version 1 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.
.Sp
Version 2 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.4.
.Sp
Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
.Sp
Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
.Sp
Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
.Sp
Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of \*(C+11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and \-\-, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
.Sp
See also \fB\-Wabi\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-access\-control\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-access-control"
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR only returns \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconstexpr\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstexpr-depth=n"
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for \*(C+11 constexpr functions
to \fIn\fR.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
.IP "\fB\-fdeduce\-init\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdeduce-init-list"
Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
\&\f(CW\*(C`std::initializer_list\*(C'\fR from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        template <class T> auto forward(T t) \-> decltype (realfn (t))
\&        {
\&          return realfn (t);
\&        }
\&        
\&        void f()
\&        {
\&          forward({1,2}); // call forward<std::initializer_list<int>>
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the \*(C+11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
.IP "\fB\-ffriend\-injection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffriend-injection"
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
\&\*(C+ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.
.Sp
This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
\&\fB\s-1NDEBUG\s0\fR.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.
.IP "\fB\-fextern\-tls\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fextern-tls-init"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-extern-tls-init"
.PD
The \*(C+11 and OpenMP standards allow \fBthread_local\fR and
\&\fBthreadprivate\fR variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining \s-1TU\s0 needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining \s-1TU\s0 will be executed before any uses in
another \s-1TU\s0), they can avoid this overhead with the
\&\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR option.
.Sp
On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
\&\fB\-fextern\-tls\-init\fR.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is \fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffor\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffor-scope"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-for-scope"
.PD
If \fB\-ffor\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR is limited to the \fBfor\fR loop itself,
as specified by the \*(C+ standard.
If \fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of \*(C+.
.Sp
If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-keywords"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR instead.
\&\fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-templates"
Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-inline\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-inline-templates"
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implement\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implement-inlines"
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by \fB#pragma implementation\fR.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
.IP "\fB\-fms\-extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fms-extensions"
Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in \s-1MFC,\s0 such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nonansi\-builtins\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nonansi-builtins"
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
\&\s-1ANSI/ISO C. \s0 These include \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_exit\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bzero\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`conjf\*(C'\fR, and other related functions.
.IP "\fB\-fnothrow\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnothrow-opt"
Treat a \f(CW\*(C`throw()\*(C'\fR exception specification as if it were a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noexcept\*(C'\fR specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the \s-1EH\s0 cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to \f(CW\*(C`terminate\*(C'\fR rather than \f(CW\*(C`unexpected\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-operator\-names\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-operator-names"
Do not treat the operator name keywords \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bitand\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`bitor\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`compl\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`not\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`or\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`xor\*(C'\fR as
synonyms as keywords.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-optional\-diags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optional-diags"
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
.IP "\fB\-fpermissive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpermissive"
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using \fB\-fpermissive\fR allows some
nonconforming code to compile.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-pretty-templates"
When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`void f(T) [with T = int]\*(C'\fR
rather than \f(CW\*(C`void f(int)\*(C'\fR) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use \fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR to disable them.
.IP "\fB\-frepo\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frepo"
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies \fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-rtti\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ run-time type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The \fBdynamic_cast\fR operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or to
unambiguous base classes.
.IP "\fB\-fstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-enums\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-enums"
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the \*(C+ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-backtrace\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=n"
Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
warning or error to \fIn\fR.  The default value is 10.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth=n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO \*(C+\s0
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in \*(C+11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-threadsafe\-statics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-threadsafe-statics"
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+
\&\s-1ABI\s0 for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-cxa\-atexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-get\-exception\-ptr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This
causes \f(CW\*(C`std::uncaught_exception\*(C'\fR to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO. \s0 Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
.Sp
You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.
.Sp
Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-ms\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-ms-compat"
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make \s-1GCC\s0's \*(C+
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
.Sp
The flag makes these changes to \s-1GCC\s0's linkage model:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
It sets the default visibility to \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR, like
\&\fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR.
.IP "2." 4
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
.IP "3." 4
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
In new code it is better to use \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
.Sp
Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the \s-1ODR\s0 to define types with the same name differently.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-fvtable\-verify=\fR\fIstd|preinit|none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvtable-verify=std|preinit|none"
Turn on (or off, if using \fB\-fvtable\-verify=none\fR) the security
feature that verifies at runtime, for every virtual call that is made, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected (at runtime), an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.
.Sp
This option causes runtime data structures to be built, at program start up,
for verifying the vtable pointers.  The options \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`preinit\*(C'\fR
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches 'main'.  The
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR causes these data structure to be built after the

\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR causes them to be built before the shared

If this option appears multiple times in the compiler line, with different

\&'preinit'; 'preinit' will take priority over 'std'.
.IP "\fB\-fvtv\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvtv-debug"
Causes debug versions of the runtime functions for the vtable verification 
feature to be called.  This assumes the \fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR or
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR has been used.  This flag will also cause the
compiler to keep track of which vtable pointers it found for each class, and
record that information in the file \*(L"vtv_set_ptr_data.log\*(R", in the dump
file directory on the user's machine.
.Sp
Note:  This feature \s-1APPENDS\s0 data to the log file. If you want a fresh log
file, be sure to delete any existing one.
.IP "\fB\-fvtv\-counts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvtv-counts"
This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR or \fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR, this
causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls
it encountered and the number of verifications it inserted.  It also
counts the number of calls to certain runtime library functions
that it inserts.  This information, for each compilation unit, is written
to a file named \*(L"vtv_count_data.log\*(R", in the dump_file directory on
the user's machine.   It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets
for each class, and writes this information to \*(L"vtv_class_set_sizes.log\*(R"
in the same directory.

Note:  This feature \s-1APPENDS\s0 data to the log files.  To get a fresh log
files, be sure to delete any existing ones.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-weak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-weak"
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-nostdinc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc++"
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
\&\*(C+, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the \*(C+ library.)
.PP
In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-Wabi\fR (C, Objective-C, \*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wabi (C, Objective-C, and Objective- only)"
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral \*(C+ \s-1ABI. \s0 Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.
.Sp
You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
.Sp
The known incompatibilities in \fB\-fabi\-version=2\fR (the default) include:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type is
mangled incorrectly:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern int N;
\&        template <int &> struct S {};
\&        void n (S<N>) {2}
.Ve

This is fixed in \fB\-fabi\-version=3\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1SIMD\s0 vector types declared using \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute ((vector_size))\*(C'\fR are

.Sp
The mangling is changed in \fB\-fabi\-version=4\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The known incompatibilities in \fB\-fabi\-version=1\fR include:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
\&        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ places \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as \f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers do not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that causes G++ and other compilers to
lay out \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ does not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers do.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that causes G++ and other
compilers to lay out \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ makes the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};
\&        
\&        struct B {
\&          A a;
\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
\&        
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ places the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Names of template functions whose types involve \f(CW\*(C`typename\*(C'\fR or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.
.Sp
.Vb 2

Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

.IP "\fB\-Wctor\-dtor\-privacy\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wctor-dtor-privacy ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no non-private
methods, and there's at least one private member function that isn't
a constructor or destructor.
.IP "\fB\-Wdelete\-non\-virtual\-dtor\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when \fBdelete\fR is used to destroy an instance of a class that
has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled
by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wliteral\-suffix\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wliteral-suffix ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does
not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming extension, \s-1GCC\s0 treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from \f(CW\*(C`<inttypes.h>\*(C'\fR.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        #define _\|_STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
\&        #include <inttypes.h>
\&        #include <stdio.h>

.Ve
.Sp
This flag is included in \fB\-Wall\fR and \fB\-Wc++11\-compat\fR.
.Sp
With \fB\-std=c++11\fR, \fB\-Wno\-narrowing\fR suppresses the diagnostic
required by the standard.  Note that this does not affect the meaning
of well-formed code; narrowing conversions are still considered
ill-formed in \s-1SFINAE\s0 context.
.IP "\fB\-Wnoexcept\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnoexcept ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. \fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR or \fBnoexcept\fR) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.
.IP "\fB\-Wnon\-virtual\-dtor\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnon-virtual-dtor ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual
destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which
case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This
warning is automatically enabled if \fB\-Weffc++\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-Wreorder\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wreorder ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not

.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-null\-sentinel\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-null-sentinel ( and Objective- only)"
Warn about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined
to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_null\*(C'\fR.  Although it is a null pointer constant rather than a
null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.
But this use is not portable across different compilers.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( and Objective- only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
\&\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR, which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-cast\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-cast ( and Objective- only)"
Warn if an old-style (C\-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a \*(C+ program.  The new-style casts (\fBdynamic_cast\fR,
\&\fBstatic_cast\fR, \fBreinterpret_cast\fR, and \fBconst_cast\fR) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.
.IP "\fB\-Woverloaded\-virtual\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Woverloaded-virtual ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:

.IX Item "-Wsign-promo ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of

unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
.SS "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialects"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective- Dialects"
(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
languages themselves.
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-g \-fgnu\-runtime \-O \-c some_class.m

In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC.\s0
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, overrides the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS X. \s0 The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (\f(CW\*(C`[receiver
message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and \s-1ABI\s0 version 0 or 1.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-abi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-abi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the Objective-C \s-1ABI\s0 for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64\-bit) \s-1ABI. \s0 If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32\-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64\-bit target machines.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.4\s0 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-direct\-dispatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-direct-dispatch"
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-exceptions"
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by \*(C+ and Java.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords \f(CW@try\fR,
\&\f(CW@throw\fR, \f(CW@catch\fR, \f(CW@finally\fR and
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  This option is available with both the \s-1GNU\s0
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.2\s0 and earlier).
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-gc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-gc"
Enable garbage collection (\s-1GC\s0) in Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-nilcheck\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-nilcheck"
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the \s-1ABI,\s0 check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
\&\fB\-fno\-objc\-nilcheck\fR.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime \s-1ABI,\s0 is used.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-std=objc1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-std=objc1"
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by \s-1GCC 4.0. \s0 This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/\*(C+ language; it does not affect conformance to C/\*(C+ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/\*(C+ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by \s-1GCC 4.0\s0 is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\-freplace\-objc\-classes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freplace-objc-classes"
Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow \fB\f(BIdyld\fB\|(1)\fR to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.3\s0
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.

If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.

.IX Item "-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the \fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR option is
being used.

selector to a receiver of type \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Class\*(C'\fR.  When this flag

if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.
.IP "\fB\-Wundeclared\-selector\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression referring to an

\&\f(CW@interface\fR or \f(CW@protocol\fR declaration, or implicitly in
an \f(CW@implementation\fR section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression is found,

.SS "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
.IX Subsection "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.
.IP "\fB\-fmessage\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmessage-length=n"
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about \fIn\fR
characters.  The default is 72 characters for \fBg++\fR and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by \s-1GCC. \s0 If \fIn\fR is zero, then no
line-wrapping is done; each error message appears on a single
line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=once"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information \fIonce\fR; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=every\-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-color"
.PD
Use color in diagnostics.  \fI\s-1WHEN\s0\fR is \fBnever\fR, \fBalways\fR,
or \fBauto\fR.  The default is \fBnever\fR if \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR environment
variable isn't present in the environment, and \fBauto\fR otherwise.
\&\fBauto\fR means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal.
The forms \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color\fR and \fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-color\fR are
aliases for \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color=always\fR and
\&\fB\-fdiagnostics\-color=never\fR, respectively.
.Sp
The colors are defined by the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (\s-1SGR\s0) substrings. \s-1SGR\s0 commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
Common values to concatenate include
\&\fB1\fR for bold,
\&\fB4\fR for underline,
\&\fB5\fR for blink,
\&\fB7\fR for inverse,
\&\fB39\fR for default foreground color,
\&\fB30\fR to \fB37\fR for foreground colors,
\&\fB90\fR to \fB97\fR for 16\-color mode foreground colors,
\&\fB38;5;0\fR to \fB38;5;255\fR
for 88\-color and 256\-color modes foreground colors,
\&\fB49\fR for default background color,
\&\fB40\fR to \fB47\fR for background colors,
\&\fB100\fR to \fB107\fR for 16\-color mode background colors,
and \fB48;5;0\fR to \fB48;5;255\fR
for 88\-color and 256\-color modes background colors.
.Sp
The default \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR is
\&\fBerror=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:caret=01;32:locus=01:quote=01\fR
where \fB01;31\fR is bold red, \fB01;35\fR is bold magenta,
\&\fB01;36\fR is bold cyan, \fB01;32\fR is bold green and
\&\fB01\fR is bold. Setting \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR to the empty
string disables colors.
Supported capabilities are as follows.

By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the

.SS "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by \s-1GCC.\s0

.IP "\fB\-fmax\-errors=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmax-errors=n"
Limits the maximum number of error messages to \fIn\fR, at which point
\&\s-1GCC\s0 bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If \fIn\fR is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR is also
specified, then \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR takes precedence over this
option.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Inhibit all warning messages.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into errors.
.IP "\fB\-Werror=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror="
Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example \fB\-Werror=switch\fR turns the warnings
controlled by \fB\-Wswitch\fR into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate \fB\-Werror\fR for specific
warnings; for example \fB\-Wno\-error=switch\fR makes
\&\fB\-Wswitch\fR warnings not be errors, even when \fB\-Werror\fR
is in effect.
.Sp
The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
\&\fB\-Werror=\fR and \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
\&\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR flag.)
.Sp
Note that specifying \fB\-Werror=\fR\fIfoo\fR automatically implies
\&\fB\-W\fR\fIfoo\fR.  However, \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR\fIfoo\fR does not
imply anything.
.IP "\fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfatal-errors"
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
\&\fB\-W\fR, for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings; for
example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to \fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and
\&\fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.
.PP
When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-warning\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the \fB\-Wno\-\fR form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for \fB\-Wno\-unknown\-warning\fR unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new \fB\-Wno\-\fR options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

Issue all the warnings demanded by strict \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0;

version of the \s-1ISO C\s0 standard specified by any \fB\-std\fR option used.
.Sp
Valid \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO C\s0).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO
C\s0 conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO C \s0\fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO C\s0 might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO C\s0 on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU
C\s0 dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-function\-declaration\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)"
Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared. In

.IP "\fB\-Wignored\-qualifiers\fR (C and \*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wignored-qualifiers (C and only)"
Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR.  For \s-1ISO C\s0 such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For \*(C+, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 prohibits qualified \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.
.Sp
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmain"
Warn if the type of \fBmain\fR is suspicious.  \fBmain\fR should be
a function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This warning
is enabled by default in \*(C+ and is enabled by either \fB\-Wall\fR

.IX Item "-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, , Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
.Sp
Also warn if a comparison like \fBx<=y<=z\fR appears; this is
equivalent to \fB(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\fR, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.Sp
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C/\*(C+, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR
can belong to the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code
looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Also warn for dangerous uses of the \s-1GNU\s0 extension to
\&\f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and \*(C+ standards.
.Sp
The C and \*(C+ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/\*(C+
program are evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and \*(C+ standards specify that \*(L"Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.\*(R".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a[n]
= b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.

Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in \*(C+, a reference) to a
variable that goes out of scope after the function returns.
.IP "\fB\-Wreturn\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wreturn-type"
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults
to \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Also warn about any \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with no
return value in a function whose return type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value), and about a \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with an
expression in a function whose return type is \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For \*(C+, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic

Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label prevents this
warning.)  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label).
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-default\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-default"

.IX Item "-Wswitch-enum"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between \fB\-Wswitch\fR and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label.
.IP "\fB\-Wsync\-nand\fR (C and \*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsync-nand (C and only)"
Warn when \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync_fetch_and_nand\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync_nand_and_fetch\*(C'\fR

Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
\&\fBvoid\fR. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as \fBx[i,j]\fR causes a warning, while

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
All the above \fB\-Wunused\fR options combined.
.Sp
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify \fB\-Wextra \-Wunused\fR (note that \fB\-Wall\fR implies
\&\fB\-Wunused\fR), or separately specify \fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wuninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call. In \*(C+,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static \fBconst\fR member
appears in a class without constructors.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of \s-1GCC\s0 used.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.IP "\fB\-Wmaybe\-uninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmaybe-uninitialized"
For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time. These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {
\&            case 1: x = 1;
\&              break;
\&            case 2: x = 4;
\&              break;
\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with \fIassert\fR\|(0) or
similar code.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
.Sp
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR or \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunknown-pragmas"
Warn when a \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR directive is encountered that is not understood by 
\&\s-1GCC. \s0 If this command-line option is used, warnings are even issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings are only enabled by the \fB\-Wall\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pragmas\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
It is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing=n"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way \fB\-O\fR 
works.
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR.
.Sp
Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 3 (default for \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
\&\f(CW\*(C`*(int*)&some_float\*(C'\fR.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=n"
.PD
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
.Sp
An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=1"
Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example,  with \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR, the compiler simplifies
\&\f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > x\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.  This level of
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=2"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`abs (x) >= 0\*(C'\fR.  This can only be
simplified when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is in effect, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`abs (INT_MIN)\*(C'\fR overflows to \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN\*(C'\fR, which is less than
zero.  \fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR (with no level) is the same as
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=3"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > 1\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x > 0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=4\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=4"
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: \f(CW\*(C`(x * 10) / 5\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x * 2\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=5\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=5"
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 2 > y\*(C'\fR is
simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 >= y\*(C'\fR.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like

Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells

.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-equal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-equal"
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
.Sp
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,

.IP "\(bu" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize \fB#elif\fR, so this option

The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating-point

headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious

address of a string literal, such as \f(CW\*(C`if (x == "abc")\*(C'\fR.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-multichar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-multichar"
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (\fB'\s-1FOOF\s0'\fR) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
.IP "\fB\-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnormalized=<none|id|nfc|nfkc>"
In \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+,\s0 two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic \s-1ASCII\s0 character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the \s-1ISO 10646\s0 standard sets out some \fInormalization rules\fR which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  \s-1GCC\s0 can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
.Sp
There are four levels of warning supported by \s-1GCC. \s0 The default is
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfc\fR, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the \s-1ISO 10646 \*(L"C\*(R"\s0 normalized form, \fI\s-1NFC\s0\fR.  \s-1NFC\s0 is the
recommended form for most uses.
.Sp
Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 that, when turned into \s-1NFC,\s0 are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 or \*(C+ and have all your identifiers in \s-1NFC.
\&\s0\fB\-Wnormalized=id\fR suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
.Sp
You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=none\fR.  You should only do this if you
are using some other normalization scheme (like \*(L"D\*(R"), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
.Sp
Some characters in \s-1ISO 10646\s0 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance \f(CW\*(C`\eu207F\*(C'\fR, \*(L"\s-1SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N\*(R",\s0 displays just like a regular \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR that has been
placed in a superscript.  \s-1ISO 10646\s0 defines the \fI\s-1NFKC\s0\fR
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and \s-1GCC\s0 warns if your code is not in \s-1NFKC\s0 if you use
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfkc\fR.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-deprecated\fR" 4

be used to relax the cost model.
.IP "\fB\-Woverride\-init\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4

.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked"
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
is misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        struct foo {
\&          int x;
\&          char a, b, c, d;
\&        } _\|_attribute_\|_((packed));
\&        struct bar {
\&          char z;
\&          struct foo f;
\&        };
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\-bitfield\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked-bitfield-compat"
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of \s-1GCC\s0 ignore the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute
on bit-fields of type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR.  This has been fixed in \s-1GCC 4.4\s0 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  \s-1GCC\s0
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in \s-1GCC 4.4.\s0
For example there is no longer a 4\-bit padding between field \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR in this structure:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        struct foo
\&        {
\&          char a:4;
\&          char b:8;
\&        } _\|_attribute_\|_ ((packed));
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by default.  Use
\&\fB\-Wno\-packed\-bitfield\-compat\fR to disable this warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wnested\-externs\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if an \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declaration is encountered within a function.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-inherited\-variadic\-ctor\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor"
Suppress warnings about use of \*(C+11 inheriting constructors when the
base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the warning is
on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( and Objective- only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \fBoffsetof\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 standard, applying \fBoffsetof\fR
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \fBoffsetof\fR typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types (such as a simple
\&\fBstruct\fR that fails to be a \s-1POD\s0 type only by virtue of having a
constructor).  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
.Sp
The restrictions on \fBoffsetof\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-int\-to\-pointer\-cast\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast"
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size. In \*(C+, casting to a pointer type of smaller size is
an error. \fBWint-to-pointer-cast\fR is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-to\-int\-cast\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)"
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-pch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-pch"
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlong-long"
Warn if \fBlong long\fR type is used.  This is enabled by either
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR or \fB\-Wtraditional\fR in \s-1ISO C90\s0 and \*(C+98
modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvariadic\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvariadic-macros"
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic \s-1ISO C90\s0 mode, or the \s-1GNU\s0
alternate syntax when in pedantic \s-1ISO C99\s0 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-variadic\-macros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvarargs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvarargs"
Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable
arguments like \fBva_start\fR.  This is default.  To inhibit the
warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-varargs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvector\-operation\-performance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvector-operation-performance"
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via \s-1SIMD\s0 capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented \f(CW\*(C`piecewise\*(C'\fR, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
\&\f(CW\*(C`in parallel\*(C'\fR, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and \f(CW\*(C`as a single scalar\*(C'\fR, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-virtual\-move\-assign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-virtual-move-assign"
Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial \*(C+11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it will be
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.
.IP "\fB\-Wvla\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvla"
Warn if variable length array is used in the code.
\&\fB\-Wno\-vla\fR prevents the \fB\-Wpedantic\fR warning of
the variable length array.
.IP "\fB\-Wvolatile\-register\-var\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvolatile-register-var"
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-sign\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR and by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, which can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-sign\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstack-protector"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
.IP "\fB\-Woverlength\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Woverlength-strings"
Warn about string constants that are longer than the \*(L"minimum
maximum\*(R" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
.Sp
The limit applies \fIafter\fR string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing \s-1NUL. \s0 In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  \*(C+98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in \*(C+.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, and can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-overlength\-strings\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunsuffixed\-float\-constants\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)"
Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with \fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the \f(CW\*(C`FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64\*(C'\fR pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
.SS "Options for Debugging Your Program or \s-1GCC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or \s-1GCC:\s0
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF, XCOFF,\s0 or \s-1DWARF 2\s0).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR, \fB\-gstabs\fR,
\&\fB\-gxcoff+\fR, \fB\-gxcoff\fR, or \fB\-gvms\fR (see below).
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
.Sp
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.Sp
The following options are useful when \s-1GCC\s0 is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
.IP "\fB\-gsplit\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gsplit-dwarf"
Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension .dwo.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo
files.
.IP "\fB\-ggdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggdb"
Produce debugging information for use by \s-1GDB. \s0 This means to use the
most expressive format available (\s-1DWARF 2,\s0 stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including \s-1GDB\s0 extensions if at all
possible.
.IP "\fB\-gpubnames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gpubnames"
Generate dwarf .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections.
.IP "\fB\-ggnu\-pubnames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggnu-pubnames"
Generate .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections in a format
suitable for conversion into a \s-1GDB\s0 index.  This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce \s-1GDB\s0 index version 7.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without \s-1GDB\s0 extensions.  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on most \s-1BSD\s0
systems.  On \s-1MIPS,\s0 Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by \s-1DBX\s0 or \s-1SDB.\s0
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-class\-debug\-always\fR" 4
.IX Item "-femit-class-debug-always"
Instead of emitting debugging information for a \*(C+ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way \s-1GCC\s0
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
.IP "\fB\-fdebug\-types\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdebug-types-section"
When using \s-1DWARF\s0 Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR section instead of making them part of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.debug_info\*(C'\fR section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all \s-1DWARF\s0 consumers support \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR sections yet
and on some objects \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs+"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
.IP "\fB\-gcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1COFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by \s-1SDB\s0 on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the \s-1DBX\s0 debugger on \s-1IBM RS/6000\s0 systems.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff+"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the \s-1GNU\s0
assembler (\s-1GAS\s0) to fail with an error.
.IP "\fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gdwarf-version"
Produce debugging information in \s-1DWARF\s0 format (if that is supported).
The value of \fIversion\fR may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version
for most targets is 4.
.Sp
Note that with \s-1DWARF\s0 Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting \s-1DWARF 3\s0 extensions in the unwind tables.
.Sp
Version 4 may require \s-1GDB 7.0\s0 and \fB\-fvar\-tracking\-assignments\fR
for maximum benefit.
.IP "\fB\-grecord\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-grecord-gcc-switches"
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in \s-1DWARF\s0 debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  See also \fB\-frecord\-gcc\-switches\fR for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-gno\-record\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gno-record-gcc-switches"
Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer attribute
in \s-1DWARF\s0 debugging information.

.IX Item "-gstrict-dwarf"
Disallow using extensions of later \s-1DWARF\s0 standard version than selected
with \fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR.  On most targets using non-conflicting
\&\s-1DWARF\s0 extensions from later standard versions is allowed.

.IX Item "-gvmslevel"
.PD
Request debugging information and also use \fIlevel\fR to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
.Sp
Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, \fB\-g0\fR negates
\&\fB\-g\fR.
.Sp
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
tables, but no information about local variables.
.Sp
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use \fB\-g3\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
\&\s-1GCC\s0 used to support an option \fB\-gdwarf\fR that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the \s-1DWARF\s0 format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional \fB\-g\fR\fIlevel\fR option to change the
debug level for \s-1DWARF.\s0
.IP "\fB\-gtoggle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gtoggle"
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=address\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=address"
Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
Memory access instructions will be instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.

.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=leak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=leak"
Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.
This option only matters for linking of executables and if neither
\&\fB\-fsanitize=address\fR nor \fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR is used.  In that
case it will link the executable against a library that overrides \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR
and other allocator functions.  See
<\fBhttps://code.google.com/p/address\-sanitizer/wiki/LeakSanitizer\fR> for more

Various computations will be instrumented to detect undefined behavior
at runtime.  Current suboptions are:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=shift\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=shift"
This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is
not undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs

\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug=\fR, with the equal sign but without \fIopts\fR,

Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.
.Sp
This option is a detailed version of
\&\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-reduced\fR and \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-baseonly\fR,
which serves for most needs.
.Sp
A specification has the syntax[\fBdir:\fR|\fBind:\fR][\fBord:\fR|\fBgen:\fR](\fBany\fR|\fBsys\fR|\fBbase\fR|\fBnone\fR)
.Sp
The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (\fBdir:\fR) or used indirectly (\fBind:\fR).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
\&\fBstruct one direct; struct two * indirect;\fR.
.Sp
The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (\fBord:\fR) or generic structs (\fBgen:\fR).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For \*(C+, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR does not yet implement them.
.Sp
The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values \fBnone\fR and \fBany\fR have the normal meaning.
The value \fBbase\fR means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling \fIfoo.c\fR, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and \fIfoo.h\fR,
but not other header files.
The value \fBsys\fR means those types satisfying \fBbase\fR
or declared in system or compiler headers.

You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.

Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a

\&\fI.su\fR to the \fIauxname\fR.  \fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
The name of the function.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A number of bytes.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier \f(CW\*(C`bounded\*(C'\fR is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by

a pass number and a word to the \fIdumpname\fR, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file. In case of
\&\fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files. Note that the pass number is
computed statically as passes get registered into the pass manager.
Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of execution of
passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin could have a
number over 200 even if it executed quite early.  \fIdumpname\fR is

Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
\&\fB\-\fR\fIoptions\fR form is used, \fIoptions\fR is a list of
\&\fB\-\fR separated options to select the dump details and
optimizations.  If \fIoptions\fR is not specified, it defaults to
\&\fBoptimized\fR for details and \fBoptall\fR for optimization
groups. If the \fIfilename\fR is not specified, it defaults to
\&\fIstderr\fR. Note that the output \fIfilename\fR will be overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, \fIstderr\fR should be used
instead.
.Sp
The options can be divided into two groups, 1) options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and 2) options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the latter options override the earlier options on the command
line. Though multiple \-fopt\-info options are accepted, only one of
them can have \fB=filename\fR. If other filenames are provided then
all but the first one are ignored.
.Sp
The dump verbosity has the following options
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimized\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimized"
Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which got
successfully vectorized.
.IP "\fBmissed\fR" 4
.IX Item "missed"
Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output. For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O2 \-ftree\-vectorize \-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed
.Ve
.Sp

vectorization passes on stderr.

.IP "\fBoptall\fR" 4

.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-missed=missed.all
.Ve
.Sp
outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
\&\fImissed.all\fR.
.Sp
As another example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-inline\-optimized\-missed=inline.txt
.Ve
.Sp
will output information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
\&\fIinline.txt\fR.
.Sp
If the \fIfilename\fR is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the \fIfilename\fR.
Otherwise the dump is output onto \fIstderr\fR. If \fIoptions\fR is
omitted, it defaults to \fBall-optall\fR, which means dump all
available optimization info from all the passes. In the following
example, all optimization info is output on to \fIstderr\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info
.Ve
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed\fR behaves the same as
\&\fB\-fopt\-info\-missed\-vec\fR.
.Sp
As another example, consider
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed=vec.miss \-fopt\-info\-loop\-optimized=loop.opt
.Ve
.Sp
Here the two output filenames \fIvec.miss\fR and \fIloop.opt\fR are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only the \fIvec.miss\fR is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

.IX Item "-frandom-seed=string"
This option provides a seed that \s-1GCC\s0 uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the \fB\-frandom\-seed\fR option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.
.Sp
The \fIstring\fR should be different for every file you compile.
.IP "\fB\-fsched\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsched-verbose=n"
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched1\fR or
\&\fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched2\fR is specified, in which case it is output
to the usual dump listing file, \fI.sched1\fR or \fI.sched2\fR
respectively.  However for \fIn\fR greater than nine, the output is
always printed to standard error.
.Sp
For \fIn\fR greater than zero, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR outputs the
same information as \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched1\fR and \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched2\fR.
For \fIn\fR greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For \fIn\fR greater
than two, it includes \s-1RTL\s0 at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
And for \fIn\fR over four, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR also includes
dependence info.

.IX Item "-save-temps=cwd"
.PD
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR produces files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.Sp
When used in combination with the \fB\-x\fR command-line option,
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
If you invoke \s-1GCC\s0 in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        gcc \-save\-temps \-o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
\&        gcc \-save\-temps \-o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&
.Ve
.Sp
may result in \fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.o\fR being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.
.IP "\fB\-save\-temps=obj\fR" 4
.IX Item "-save-temps=obj"
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently.  If the
\&\fB\-o\fR option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the \fB\-o\fR option is not used, the
\&\fB\-save\-temps=obj\fR switch behaves like \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3

\&        gcc \-save\-temps=obj foobar.c \-o dir2/yfoobar
.Ve
.Sp
creates \fIfoo.i\fR, \fIfoo.s\fR, \fIdir/xbar.i\fR,

.IP "\fB\-time\fR[\fB=\fR\fIfile\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-time[=file]"
Report the \s-1CPU\s0 time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).
.Sp
Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # cc1 0.12 0.01
\&        # as 0.00 0.01
.Ve
.Sp
The first number on each line is the \*(L"user time\*(R", that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is \*(L"system time\*(R",
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.Sp
With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        0.12 0.01 cc1 <options>
\&        0.00 0.01 as <options>
.Ve
.Sp
The \*(L"user time\*(R" and the \*(L"system time\*(R" are moved before the program

Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF 2\s0 output, \s-1GCC\s0 avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have \s-1GCC\s0 emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
.SS "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
.PP
Most optimizations are only enabled if an \fB\-O\fR level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.
.PP
Depending on the target and how \s-1GCC\s0 was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each \fB\-O\fR level than
those listed here.  You can invoke \s-1GCC\s0 with \fB\-Q \-\-help=optimizers\fR

check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the \fB\-fno\-keep\-static\-consts\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmerge-constants"
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.
.Sp
This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use \fB\-fno\-merge\-constants\fR to inhibit this
behavior.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fmerge\-all\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmerge-all-constants"
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
.Sp
This option implies \fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR.  In addition to
\&\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or \*(C+ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched"
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\-allow\-regmoves\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves"
Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
\&\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-branch\-count\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-branch-count-reg"
Do not use \*(L"decrement and branch\*(R" instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result.
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, \s-1IA\-64\s0 and S/390.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fbranch\-count\-reg\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-function\-cse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-function-cse"
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
.Sp
This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ffunction\-cse\fR
.IP "\fB\-fno\-zero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss"
If the target supports a \s-1BSS\s0 section, \s-1GCC\s0 by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into \s-1BSS. \s0 This can save space in the resulting
code.
.Sp
This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section\-\-\-e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fzero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fthread\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fthread-jumps"
Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-wide\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-wide-types"
When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as \f(CW\*(C`long
long\*(C'\fR on a 32\-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR,
\&\fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-follow-jumps"
In common subexpression elimination (\s-1CSE\s0), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when \s-1CSE\s0 encounters an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with an
\&\f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR clause, \s-1CSE\s0 follows the jump when the condition
tested is false.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-skip-blocks"
This is similar to \fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR, but causes \s-1CSE\s0 to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When \s-1CSE\s0
encounters a simple \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with no else clause,
\&\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR causes \s-1CSE\s0 to follow the jump around the
body of the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR" 4

Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse"
Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR When compiling a program using computed gotos, a \s-1GCC\s0
extension, you may get better run-time performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
\&\fB\-fno\-gcse\fR to the command line.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-lm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR is enabled, global common subexpression elimination
attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.
.Sp
Enabled by default when \fB\-fgcse\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-sm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-las\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-las"
When \fB\-fgcse\-las\fR is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-after-reload"
When \fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to clean up
redundant spilling.
.IP "\fB\-faggressive\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-faggressive-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling
and loop exit test optimizations.
This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to assume that loop indices do not
overflow, and that loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are valid.
If you use \fB\-Wunsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR, the compiler warns you
if it finds this kind of loop.
.IP "\fB\-fcrossjumping\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcrossjumping"
Perform cross-jumping transformation.
This transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.
.Sp

.IP "\fB\-fauto\-inc\-dec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fauto-inc-dec"
Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher on architectures that support this.
.IP "\fB\-fdce\fR" 4

Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fif\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fif-conversion"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by \f(CW\*(C`if\-conversion2\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fif\-conversion2\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-fdeclone\-ctor\-dtor\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdeclone-ctor-dtor"
The \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 requires multiple entry points for constructors and
destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object, and
one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards.
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that call a common
implementation.
.Sp
Enabled by \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-null-pointer-checks"
Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in \s-1GCC\s0 use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.
.Sp
Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use \fB\-fno\-delete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.
.Sp
Some targets, especially embedded ones, disable this option at all levels.
Otherwise it is enabled at all levels: \fB\-O0\fR, \fB\-O1\fR,
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.  Passes that use the information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (\f(CW\*(C`\-findirect\-inlining\*(C'\fR) and interprocedural constant
propagation (\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR).
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\-speculatively\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize-speculatively"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct calls.
Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into an conditional deciding on direct and indirect call.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem
useless after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.
.IP "\fB\-fexpensive\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexpensive-optimizations"
Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.

size register sets.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-algorithm=\fR\fIalgorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-algorithm=algorithm"
Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The \fIalgorithm\fR argument can be \fBpriority\fR, which
specifies Chow's priority coloring, or \fB\s-1CB\s0\fR, which specifies
Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented
for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is
the default because it generates better code.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-region=\fR\fIregion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-region=region"
Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
\&\fIregion\fR argument should be one of the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Use all loops as register allocation regions.
This can give the best results for machines with a small and/or
irregular register set.
.IP "\fBmixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "mixed"
Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure 
as the regions.  This value usually gives
the best results in most cases and for most architectures,

(\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, ...).
.IP "\fBone\fR" 4
.IX Item "one"

This option is enabled at level \fB\-Os\fR for all targets.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-loop\-pressure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-loop-pressure"
Use \s-1IRA\s0 to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move
loop invariants.  This option usually results in generation
of faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (>= 32
registers), but it can slow the compiler down.
.Sp
This option is enabled at level \fB\-O3\fR for some targets.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ira\-share\-save\-slots\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-save-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard

.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-spill-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each

.IP "\fB\-fira\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-verbose=n"
Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.
The default value is 5.  If the value \fIn\fR is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as \fIn\fR minus 10.

.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns"
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating-point instruction is required.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns2"
Similar to \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is

Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation is enabled, i.e. with \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR or at

.IX Item "-fsched2-use-superblocks"
When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock scheduling.

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-phiprop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-phiprop"
Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
pass is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fhoist\-adjacent\-loads\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fhoist-adjacent-loads"
Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if the
loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the target
architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag is enabled
by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copy\-prop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copy-prop"
Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-pure\-const\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-pure-const"
Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-reference\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-reference"
Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-pta\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-pta"
Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-profile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-profile"
Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`cold\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp"
Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-Os\fR and \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\-clone\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp-clone"
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see \fB\-\-param ipcp\-unit\-growth=\fR\fIvalue\fR).
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fisolate\-erroneous\-paths\-dereference\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference"
Detect paths which trigger erroneous or undefined behaviour due to
dereferencing a \s-1NULL\s0 pointer.  Isolate those paths from the main control
flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined behaviour into a trap.
.IP "\fB\-fisolate\-erroneous\-paths\-attribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute"
Detect paths which trigger erroneous or undefined behaviour due a \s-1NULL\s0 value
being used in a way which is forbidden by a \f(CW\*(C`returns_nonnull\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`nonnull\*(C'\fR
attribute.  Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the
statement with erroneous or undefined behaviour into a trap.  This is not
currently enabled, but may be enabled by \f(CW\*(C`\-O2\*(C'\fR in the future.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sink\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sink"
Perform forward store motion  on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-bit\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-bit-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate
pointer alignment information.
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It requires that \fB\-ftree\-ccp\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (\s-1CCP\s0) on trees.  This
pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-switch\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-switch-conversion"
Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-tail\-merge\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-tail-merge"
Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using \fBmax-tail-merge-comparisons\fR parameter and
\&\fBmax-tail-merge-iterations\fR parameter.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dce\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dce"
Perform dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) on trees.  This flag is enabled by
default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-builtin\-call\-dce\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-builtin-call-dce"
Perform conditional dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) for calls to built-in functions
that may set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR but are otherwise side-effect free.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher if \fB\-Os\fR is not also
specified.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dominator\-opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dominator-opts"
Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dse"
Perform dead store elimination (\s-1DSE\s0) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ch"
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It is not enabled
for \fB\-Os\fR, since it usually increases code size.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-optimize"
Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-linear\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-linear"
Perform loop interchange transformations on tree.  Same as
\&\fB\-floop\-interchange\fR.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has
to be configured with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-interchange\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-interchange"
Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a
loop like:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO J = 1, M
\&          DO I = 1, N
\&            A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
loop interchange transforms the loop as if it were written:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          DO J = 1, M
\&            A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
which can be beneficial when \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR is larger than the caches,
because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization
applies to all the languages supported by \s-1GCC\s0 and is not limited to
Fortran.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has to be configured
with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to enable the
Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-strip\-mine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-strip-mine"
Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR parameter.  For example,
given a loop like:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          A(I) = A(I) + C
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
loop strip mining transforms the loop as if it were written:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO II = 1, N, 51
\&          DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
\&            A(I) = A(I) + C
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
This optimization applies to all the languages supported by \s-1GCC\s0 and is
not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has to
be configured with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-block\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-block"
Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the
element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be changed
using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR parameter.  For example, given
a loop like:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          DO J = 1, M
\&            A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
loop blocking transforms the loop as if it were written:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        DO II = 1, N, 51
\&          DO JJ = 1, M, 51
\&            DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
\&              DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
\&                A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
\&              ENDDO
\&            ENDDO
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
which can be beneficial when \f(CW\*(C`M\*(C'\fR is larger than the caches,
because the innermost loop iterates over a smaller amount of data
which can be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to all the
languages supported by \s-1GCC\s0 and is not limited to Fortran.  To use this
code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has to be configured with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR
and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to enable the Graphite loop transformation
infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-fgraphite\-identity\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgraphite-identity"
Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
\&\fB\-fgraphite\-identity\fR we can check the costs or benefits of the
\&\s-1GIMPLE \-\s0> \s-1GRAPHITE \-\s0> \s-1GIMPLE\s0 transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator CLooG, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-nest\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-nest-optimize"
Enable the \s-1ISL\s0 based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest
optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop
structure optimized for data-locality and parallelism.  This option
is experimental.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-parallelize\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-parallelize-all"
Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can
be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be analyzed to
not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it is
profitable to parallelize the loops.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-data\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-data-deps"
Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.  This option
is used for debugging the data dependence analyzers.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-if\-convert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-if-convert"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-if\-convert\-stores\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores"
Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory writes.
This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded programs as it
transforms conditional memory writes into unconditional memory writes.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
\&          if (cond)
\&            A[i] = expr;

.Vb 2
\&        for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
\&          A[i] = cond ? expr : A[i];
.Ve
.Sp
potentially producing data races.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-distribution\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-distribution"
Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          A(I) = B(I) + C
\&          D(I) = E(I) * F
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
is transformed to
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           A(I) = B(I) + C
\&        ENDDO
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           D(I) = E(I) * F
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-distribute\-patterns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns"
Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
.Sp
This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          A(I) = 0
\&          B(I) = A(I) + I
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
is transformed to
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           A(I) = 0
\&        ENDDO
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           B(I) = A(I) + I
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset zero.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-im\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-im"
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
are hard to handle at \s-1RTL\s0 level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With \fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-ivcanon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-ivcanon"
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
.IP "\fB\-fivopts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fivopts"
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-parallelize\-loops=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-parallelize-loops=n"
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for \fB\-pthread\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-pta\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-pta"
Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sra"
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copyrename"
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-inlined\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars"
Tell the copyrename pass (see \fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR) to attempt to
combine small user-defined variables too, but only if they were inlined
from other functions.  It is a more limited form of
\&\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR.  This may harm debug information of such
inlined variables, but it will keep variables of the inlined-into
function apart from each other, such that they are more likely to
contain the expected values in a debugging session.  This was the
default in \s-1GCC\s0 versions older than 4.7.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-vars"
Tell the copyrename pass (see \fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR) to attempt to
combine small user-defined variables too, instead of just compiler
temporaries.  This may severely limit the ability to debug an optimized
program compiled with \fB\-fno\-var\-tracking\-assignments\fR.  In the
negated form, this flag prevents \s-1SSA\s0 coalescing of user variables,
including inlined ones.  This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ter"
Perform temporary expression replacement during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better \s-1RTL\s0 generation.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-slsr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-slsr"
Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes related
expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by less expensive
calculations when possible.  This is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vectorize"
Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables \fB\-ftree\-loop\-vectorize\fR
and \fB\-ftree\-slp\-vectorize\fR if not explicitly specified.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-vectorize"
Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O3\fR and when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-slp\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-slp-vectorize"
Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O3\fR and when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fvect\-cost\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvect-cost-model=model"
Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The \fImodel\fR argument
should be one of \f(CW\*(C`unlimited\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR.
With the \f(CW\*(C`unlimited\*(C'\fR model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR model a runtime check
will guard the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration
counts that will likely execute faster than when executing the original
scalar loop.  The \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR model will disable vectorization of
loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to
required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise
is equal to the \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR model.
The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is
either \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsimd\-cost\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsimd-cost-model=model"
Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP
or Cilk Plus simd directive.  The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of
\&\f(CW\*(C`unlimited\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR.  All values of \fImodel\fR
have the same meaning as described in \fB\-fvect\-cost\-model\fR and by
default a cost model defined with \fB\-fvect\-cost\-model\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vrp"
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if \fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR is
enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftracer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftracer"
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
a better job.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
\&\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR implies the same options as
\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR,
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-ivs\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"
Enables expression of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
A combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body
is more complicated than a single basic block.  It also does not work at all
on some architectures due to restrictions in the \s-1CSE\s0 pass.
.Sp
This optimization is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fvariable\-expansion\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller"
With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result in superior code.
.IP "\fB\-fpartial\-inlining\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpartial-inlining"
Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the \fB\-finline\-functions\fR

.IP "\fB\-fprefetch\-loop\-arrays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprefetch-loop-arrays"
If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference
between \fB\-fno\-peephole\fR and \fB\-fno\-peephole2\fR is in how they
are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
other, a few use both.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpeephole\fR is enabled by default.
\&\fB\-fpeephole2\fR enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-guess\-branch\-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-guess-branch-probability"
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR, then the heuristics are
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects

In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order

This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of

subsections \f(CW\*(C`.text.hot\*(C'\fR for most frequently executed functions and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.text.unlikely\*(C'\fR for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.

.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;
\&        };
\&        
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called \*(L"type-punning\*(R") is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.    However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        int f() {
\&          double d = 3.0;
\&          return ((union a_union *) &d)\->i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR option is enabled at levels
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-overflow"
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it does not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler assumes
that an expression like \f(CW\*(C`i + 10 > i\*(C'\fR is always true for
signed \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`i + 10\*(C'\fR overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers 
overflows must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
.Sp
This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that \f(CW\*(C`p + u >
p\*(C'\fR is always true for a pointer \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR and unsigned integer
\&\f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`p + u\*(C'\fR overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.
.Sp
See also the \fB\-fwrapv\fR option.  Using \fB\-fwrapv\fR means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR is used, there is no difference between
\&\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR and \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR for
integers.  With \fB\-fwrapv\fR certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, but not otherwise.
.Sp
The \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR option is enabled at levels
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.

Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as \s-1CSE,\s0 loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a

.Sp
Enabled by default with \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fwhole\-program\fR" 4

Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
and those merged by attribute \f(CW\*(C`externally_visible\*(C'\fR become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.
.Sp
This option should not be used in combination with \f(CW\*(C`\-flto\*(C'\fR.
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.
.IP "\fB\-flto[=\fR\fIn\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto[=n]"
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates \s-1GIMPLE \s0(one of \s-1GCC\s0's internal
representations) and writes it to special \s-1ELF\s0 sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these \s-1ELF\s0 sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
.Sp
To use the link-time optimizer, \fB\-flto\fR and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
The first two invocations to \s-1GCC\s0 save a bytecode representation
of \s-1GIMPLE\s0 into special \s-1ELF\s0 sections inside \fIfoo.o\fR and
\&\fIbar.o\fR.  The final invocation reads the \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode from
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in \s-1GCC\s0 to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
\&\fIbar.o\fR into functions in \fIfoo.o\fR and vice-versa.
.Sp
Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.c bar.c
.Ve
.Sp
The above generates bytecode for \fIfoo.c\fR and \fIbar.c\fR,
merges them together into a single \s-1GIMPLE\s0 representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce \fImyprog\fR.
.Sp
The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to perform the link-step.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 then automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the \fB\-flto\fR.  You generally
should specify the optimization options to be used for link-time
optimization though \s-1GCC\s0 will try to be clever at guessing an
optimization level to use from the options used at compile-time
if you fail to specify one at link-time.  You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization at link-time
by passing \fB\-fno\-lto\fR to the link command.
.Sp
To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
.Sp
When \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR is not enabled then, when a file is
compiled with \fB\-flto\fR, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and the usual
final code (see \fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR.  This means that
object files with \s-1LTO\s0 information can be linked as normal object
files; if \fB\-fno\-lto\fR is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR is enabled the compile-stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.
.Sp
Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O0 \-ffat\-lto\-objects \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O0 \-ffat\-lto\-objects \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-O3 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary \fImyprog\fR is optimized at
\&\fB\-O3\fR.  If, instead, the final binary is generated with
\&\fB\-fno\-lto\fR, then \fImyprog\fR is not optimized.
.Sp
When producing the final binary, \s-1GCC\s0 only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and final object code.  \s-1GCC\s0 automatically selects
which files to optimize in \s-1LTO\s0 mode and which files to link without
further processing.
.Sp
There are some code generation flags preserved by \s-1GCC\s0 when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Generally options specified at link-time override those
specified at compile-time.
.Sp
If you do not specify an optimization level option \fB\-O\fR at
link-time then \s-1GCC\s0 will compute one based on the optimization levels
used when compiling the object files.  The highest optimization
level will win here.
.Sp
Currently, the following options and their setting are take from
the first object file that explicitely specified it: 
\&\fB\-fPIC\fR, \fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fcommon\fR,
\&\fB\-fexceptions\fR, \fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR, \fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR
and all the \fB\-m\fR target flags.
.Sp
Certain \s-1ABI\s0 changing flags are required to match in all compilation-units
and trying to override this at link-time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as \fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR
and \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR.
.Sp
Other options such as \fB\-ffp\-contract\fR, \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR,
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, \fB\-fno\-trapv\fR or \fB\-fno\-strict\-aliasing\fR
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
\&\fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR, \fB\-fwrapv\fR and \fB\-fno\-trapv\fR take
precedence and for example \fB\-ffp\-contract=off\fR takes precedence
over \fB\-ffp\-contract=fast\fR.  You can override them at linke-time.
.Sp
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.
.Sp
If \s-1LTO\s0 encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to \s-1ISO C99 6.2.7\s0), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.
.Sp
Another feature of \s-1LTO\s0 is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        gcc \-c \-flto foo.c
\&        g++ \-c \-flto bar.cc
\&        gfortran \-c \-flto baz.f90
\&        g++ \-o myprog \-flto \-O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o \-lgfortran
.Ve
.Sp
Notice that the final link is done with \fBg++\fR to get the \*(C+
runtime libraries and \fB\-lgfortran\fR is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in \s-1LTO\s0 mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.
.Sp
If object files containing \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
\&\fIlibfoo.a\fR, it is possible to extract and use them in an \s-1LTO\s0 link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for \s-1LTO,\s0 use \fBgcc-ar\fR and \fBgcc-ranlib\fR instead of \fBar\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`ranlib\*(C'\fR; to show the symbols of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode, use
\&\fBgcc-nm\fR.  Those commands require that \fBar\fR, \fBranlib\fR
and \fBnm\fR have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the the
flag \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR to ensure that the library participates in
the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-O2 \-flto \-fuse\-linker\-plugin a.o b.o \-lfoo
.Ve
.Sp
With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 files from \fIlibfoo.a\fR and passes them on to the running \s-1GCC\s0
to make them part of the aggregated \s-1GIMPLE\s0 image to be optimized.
.Sp
If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside \fIlibfoo.a\fR
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both \s-1LTO\s0 optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
\&\fB\-flto\fR \f(CW\*(C`\-ffat\-lto\-objects\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine \fB\-flto\fR and \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR).
.Sp
The current implementation of \s-1LTO\s0 makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will not work with an older or newer version of \s-1GCC.\s0
.Sp
Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining \fB\-flto\fR with
\&\fB\-g\fR is currently experimental and expected to produce unexpected
results.
.Sp
If you specify the optional \fIn\fR, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using \fIn\fR
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed \fBmake\fR program.  The
environment variable \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for \fIn\fR is 1.
.Sp
You can also specify \fB\-flto=jobserver\fR to use \s-1GNU\s0 make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling \s-1GCC\s0 is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a \fB+\fR to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR is
\&\s-1GNU\s0 make.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-partition=\fR\fIalg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-partition=alg"
Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
The value is either \f(CW\*(C`1to1\*(C'\fR to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or \f(CW\*(C`balanced\*(C'\fR to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is \f(CW\*(C`balanced\*(C'\fR. While \f(CW\*(C`1to1\*(C'\fR can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR
partitioning is intended for internal testing only.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-compression\-level=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-compression-level=n"
This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to \s-1LTO\s0 object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with \s-1LTO\s0 mode (\fB\-flto\fR).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-report\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-report"
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time

.IP "\fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-linker-plugin"
Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in \s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer.
.Sp
This option enables the extraction of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-fwhole\-program\*(C'\fR.
See \fB\-flto\fR for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.
.Sp
This option is enabled by default when \s-1LTO\s0 support in \s-1GCC\s0 is enabled
and \s-1GCC\s0 was configured for use with
a linker supporting plugins (\s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer or gold).
.IP "\fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffat-lto-objects"
Fat \s-1LTO\s0 objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language

and is ignored at link time.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR improves compilation time over plain \s-1LTO,\s0 but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of \s-1LTO.\s0 It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
\&\fBnm\fR, \fBar\fR and \fBranlib\fR
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  \s-1GCC\s0 provides the \fBgcc-ar\fR,
\&\fBgcc-nm\fR, \fBgcc-ranlib\fR wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat \s-1LTO\s0 makefiles need to be modified to use them.

.IX Item "-fprofile-correction"
Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may
be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option is specified,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, \s-1GCC\s0 emits an error message when an inconsistent profile is detected.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-dir=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-dir=path"
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to \fIpath\fR.
This option affects only the profile data generated by

The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point 
arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ffloat\-store\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffloat-store"
Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.
.Sp
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point.  Use \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
.IP "\fB\-fexcess\-precision=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexcess-precision=style"
This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point registers have more precision than the \s-1IEEE
\&\s0\f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR types and the processor does not
support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=fast\fR is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is specified then excess
precision follows the rules specified in \s-1ISO C99\s0; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as \fB\-std=c99\fR is used.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is not implemented for languages
other than C, and has no effect if
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR or \fB\-ffast\-math\fR is
specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if \fB\-mfpmath=sse\fR
or \fB\-mfpmath=sse+387\fR is specified; in the former case, \s-1IEEE\s0
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.

.Sp
This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FAST_MATH_\|_\*(C'\fR to be defined.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option besides
\&\fB\-Ofast\fR since it can result in incorrect output for programs
that depend on an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications

.IX Item "-fno-math-errno"
Do not set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., \f(CW\*(C`sqrt\*(C'\fR.  A program that relies on
\&\s-1IEEE\s0 exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic compatibility.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fmath\-errno\fR.
.Sp
On Darwin systems, the math library never sets \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and \fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR is the default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-math-optimizations"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate \s-1IEEE\s0 or

or startup files that change the default \s-1FPU\s0 control word or other
similar optimizations.

The default is \fB\-fno\-unsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fassociative\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fassociative-math"
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the \s-1ISO C\s0 and \*(C+ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
\&\f(CW\*(C`(x + 2**52) \- 2**52\*(C'\fR.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with \fB\-frounding\-math\fR. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR are in effect.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-associative\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freciprocal\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freciprocal-math"
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example \f(CW\*(C`x / y\*(C'\fR
can be replaced with \f(CW\*(C`x * (1/y)\*(C'\fR, which is useful if \f(CW\*(C`(1/y)\*(C'\fR
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

The default is \fB\-fno\-reciprocal\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffinite-math-only"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +\-Infs.

This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-finite\-math\-only\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-signed-zeros"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and \-0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with \fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fsigned\-zeros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-trapping-math"
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that \fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on \*(L"non-stop\*(R" \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic, for example.
.Sp
This option should never be turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frounding\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frounding-math"
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point
rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-rounding\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all \s-1GCC\s0 optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR pragma.  This command-line option

.IP "\fB\-fsignaling\-nans\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsignaling-nans"
Compile code assuming that \s-1IEEE\s0 signaling NaNs may generate user-visible
traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.

This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_SUPPORT_SNAN_\|_\*(C'\fR to

Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of
implicitly converting them to double-precision constants.
.IP "\fB\-fcx\-limited\-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcx-limited-range"
When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is \f(CW\*(C`NaN

.Sp
This option controls the default setting of the \s-1ISO C99

all languages.
.IP "\fB\-fcx\-fortran\-rules\fR" 4

After running a program compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, you can compile it a second time using
\&\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When a program
compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR exits, it saves arc execution
counts to a file called \fI\fIsourcename\fI.gcda\fR for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 puts a
\&\fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR note on each \fB\s-1JUMP_INSN\s0\fR and \fB\s-1CALL_INSN\s0\fR.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in \fIreorg.c\fR, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the \fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.

.IX Item "-fprofile-values"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, it adds code so that some

.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, it reads back the data gathered

Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operations
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
.IP "\fB\-frename\-registers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frename-registers"
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
most benefits processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in
a \*(L"home register\*(R".

Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR, \fB\-fweb\fR and \fB\-frename\-registers\fR.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.

.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when

Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems

.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize"
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue

.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in

.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end

.IX Item "max-goto-duplication-insns"
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps

unfactored.  The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an

.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to

compilation time.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-single\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-single"
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in \s-1GCC.\s0
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in \s-1GCC\s0's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (\*(C+).
The default value is 400.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 40.
.IP "\fBinline-min-speedup\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-min-speedup"
When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this

max-inline-insns-auto\fR.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
\&\fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.
The default value is 2700.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-unit-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-unit-insns"
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
For small units this might be too tight.
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\e% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to \fB\-\-param large-unit-insns\fR
before applying \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.  The default is 10000.
.IP "\fBinline-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"

.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame-growth"

self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline, \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive\fR is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is

default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmin-inline-recursive-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-inline-recursive-probability"
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.
.Sp
When profile feedback is available (see \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function recurses via a
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expressions
whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).
The default value is 10.

.IX Item "gcse-cost-distance-ratio"
Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than \fBgcse-unrestricted-cost\fR.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.
.IP "\fBgcse-unrestricted-cost\fR" 4
.IX Item "gcse-unrestricted-cost"
Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,

allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
The default value is 3.

.IX Item "max-hoist-depth"
The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.

The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound.
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while

.IX Item "tracer-max-code-growth"
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is

\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This

generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM \s0>= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\*(R"\s0 is

\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and

Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering

The default is the smaller of \s-1RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS,\s0 or a limit that

with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this

.IX Item "min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio"
The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.
.IP "\fBprefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio"
The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.
.IP "\fBuse-canonical-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "use-canonical-types"
Whether the compiler should use the \*(L"canonical\*(R" type system.  By
default, this should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in \*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.
.IP "\fBswitch-conversion-max-branch-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio"
Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are
bigger than \fBswitch-conversion-max-branch-ratio\fR times the number of
branches in the switch.
.IP "\fBmax-partial-antic-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-partial-antic-length"
Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (\fB\-ftree\-pre\fR) when
optimizing at \fB\-O3\fR and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.
.IP "\fBsccvn-max-scc-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "sccvn-max-scc-size"
Maximum size of a strongly connected component (\s-1SCC\s0) during \s-1SCCVN\s0
processing.  If this limit is hit, \s-1SCCVN\s0 processing for the whole
function is not done and optimizations depending on it are
disabled.  The default maximum \s-1SCC\s0 size is 10000.
.IP "\fBsccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access\fR" 4
.IX Item "sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access"
Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for
redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search
is aborted and the load or store is not considered redundant.  The
number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of
stores on all paths from the load to the function entry.
The default maxmimum number of queries is 1000.
.IP "\fBira-max-loops-num\fR" 4
.IX Item "ira-max-loops-num"
\&\s-1IRA\s0 uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most
the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.  The default value of the
parameter is 100.
.IP "\fBira-max-conflict-table-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "ira-max-conflict-table-size"
Although \s-1IRA\s0 uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in \s-1MB\s0 given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.  
The default value of the parameter is 2000.
.IP "\fBira-loop-reserved-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "ira-loop-reserved-regs"
\&\s-1IRA\s0 can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see \fB\-O3\fR).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  The default value of the parameter is 2, which is
the minimal number of registers needed by typical instructions.
This value is the best found from numerous experiments.
.IP "\fBloop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop"
Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.  The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for \fB\-O1\fR and 10000 for \fB\-O2\fR and above.
.IP "\fBloop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps"
Building data dapendencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops are no
handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.
The default value is 1000.
.IP "\fBmax-vartrack-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-vartrack-size"
Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.
.IP "\fBmax-vartrack-expr-depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-vartrack-expr-depth"
Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.  The default is 12.
.IP "\fBmin-nondebug-insn-uid\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-nondebug-insn-uid"
Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by

.IX Item "ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor"
IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new

\&\fBipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor\fR times the size of the original
pointer parameter.
.IP "\fBtm-max-aggregate-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "tm-max-aggregate-size"
When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables are
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
\&\fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR.
.IP "\fBgraphite-max-nb-scop-params\fR" 4
.IX Item "graphite-max-nb-scop-params"
To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters.  A variable whose value is unknown at
compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.
.IP "\fBgraphite-max-bbs-per-function\fR" 4
.IX Item "graphite-max-bbs-per-function"
To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the size of
the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The default value is
100 basic blocks.

.IX Item "loop-block-tile-size"
Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
\&\fB\-floop\-block\fR or \fB\-floop\-strip\-mine\fR, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR
parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.
.IP "\fBipa-cp-value-list-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipa-cp-value-list-size"
IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization.
\&\fBipa-cp-value-list-size\fR is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.
.IP "\fBipa-cp-eval-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipa-cp-eval-threshold"
IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability heuristics

.IP "\fBipa-max-agg-items\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipa-max-agg-items"
IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar values passed

.IX Item "ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus"
When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the number

the candidate.
.IP "\fBipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus"
When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the index of

.IP "\fBlto-partitions\fR" 4
.IX Item "lto-partitions"
Specify desired number of partitions produced during \s-1WHOPR\s0 compilation.
The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation.
The default value is 32.
.IP "\fBlto-minpartition\fR" 4
.IX Item "lto-minpartition"
Size of minimal partition for \s-1WHOPR \s0(in estimated instructions).
This prevents expenses of splitting very small programs into too many

.IP "\fBcxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help"
The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions when \*(C+
name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.
.IP "\fBsink-frequency-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "sink-frequency-threshold"
The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement's original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking.
The default value is 75.  A small positive adjustment is applied for
statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.
.IP "\fBmax-stores-to-sink\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-stores-to-sink"
The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR) or if-conversion

.IP "\fBallow-packed-load-data-races\fR" 4
.IX Item "allow-packed-load-data-races"
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data loads.

unless implicitly set by the \fB\-fmemory\-model=\fR option.
.IP "\fBallow-packed-store-data-races\fR" 4
.IX Item "allow-packed-store-data-races"
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data stores.

unless implicitly set by the \fB\-fmemory\-model=\fR option.
.IP "\fBcase-values-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "case-values-threshold"
The smallest number of different values for which it is best to use a
jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.  If the value is
0, use the default for the machine.  The default is 0.
.IP "\fBtree-reassoc-width\fR" 4
.IX Item "tree-reassoc-width"
Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel in
reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target dependent
heuristics used by default if has non zero value.
.IP "\fBsched-pressure-algorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "sched-pressure-algorithm"
Choose between the two available implementations of
\&\fB\-fsched\-pressure\fR.  Algorithm 1 is the original implementation
and is the more likely to prevent instructions from being reordered.
Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise between the relatively
conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive
approach taken by the default scheduler.  It relies more heavily on
having a regular register file and accurate register pressure classes.
See \fIhaifa\-sched.c\fR in the \s-1GCC\s0 sources for more details.
.Sp
The default choice depends on the target.
.IP "\fBmax-slsr-cand-scan\fR" 4

Set the maximum number of existing candidates that will be considered when
seeking a basis for a new straight-line strength reduction candidate.
.IP "\fBasan-globals\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-globals"
Enable buffer overflow detection for global objects.  This kind
of protection is enabled by default if you are using
\&\fB\-fsanitize=address\fR option.
To disable global objects protection use \fB\-\-param asan\-globals=0\fR.
.IP "\fBasan-stack\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-stack"
Enable buffer overflow detection for stack objects.  This kind of

.IP "\fBasan-instrument-writes\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-instrument-writes"
Enable buffer overflow detection for memory writes.  This kind of

To disable memory writes protection use
\&\fB\-\-param asan\-instrument\-writes=0\fR option.
.IP "\fBasan-memintrin\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-memintrin"
Enable detection for built-in functions.  This kind of protection
is enabled by default when using \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR.
To disable built-in functions protection use
\&\fB\-\-param asan\-memintrin=0\fR.
.IP "\fBasan-use-after-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-use-after-return"
Enable detection of use-after-return.  This kind of protection

.IP "\fBasan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold"
If number of memory accesses in function being instrumented

.SS "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
.PP
If you use the \fB\-E\fR option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with \fB\-E\fR because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
.IP "\fB\-Wp,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wp,option"
You can use \fB\-Wp,\fR\fIoption\fR to bypass the compiler driver
and pass \fIoption\fR directly through to the preprocessor.  If
\&\fIoption\fR contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
\&\fB\-Wp\fR forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using \fB\-Wp\fR and let the driver handle the
options instead.
.IP "\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xpreprocessor option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not 
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
.IP "\fB\-no\-integrated\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-integrated-cpp"
Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(\fBcc1\fR, \fBcc1plus\fR, or \fBcc1obj\fR for C, \*(C+,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the \fB\-B\fR or
\&\fB\-wrapper\fR options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \f(CW1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name=definition"
The contents of \fIdefinition\fR are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a \fB#define\fR
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.
.Sp
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With \fBsh\fR and \fBcsh\fR,
\&\fB\-D'\fR\fIname\fR\fB(\fR\fIargs...\fR\fB)=\fR\fIdefinition\fR\fB'\fR works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR and

\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Cancel any previous definition of \fIname\fR, either built in or
provided with a \fB\-D\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I dir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by \fB\-I\fR are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory \fIdir\fR is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
\&.
If \fIdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Write output to \fIfile\fR.  This is the same as specifying \fIfile\fR
as the second non-option argument to \fBcpp\fR.  \fBgcc\fR has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use \fB\-o\fR to specify the output file.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is \fB\-Wcomment\fR, \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR,
\&\fB\-Wmultichar\fR and a warning about integer promotion causing a

(Both forms have the same effect.)
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (\fB??/\fR at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  If \fB\-Wall\fR is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other

.IX Item "-Wtraditional"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and

replaced with zero.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-macros"
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is \fIused\fR if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
.Sp
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then \s-1CPP\s0 will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
.Sp

.IP "\fB\-Wendif\-labels\fR" 4

Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:

.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.Sp
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
.IP "\fB\-MMD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MMD"
Like \fB\-MD\fR except mention only user header files, not system

.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-preprocess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-preprocess"
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with \fB\-E\fR.  It inserts a special \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "\f(CIfilename\f(CW"\*(C'\fR in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its \fIfilename\fR.
When \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is in use, \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR
and loads the \s-1PCH.\s0
.Sp
This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to \s-1GCC. \s0 It is switched on by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
You should not write this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the \s-1PCH\s0 file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to \s-1GCC\s0's
current directory.

Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has

selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:

extensions for \*(C+ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
.Sp
The option's behavior depends on the \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR
options.
.Sp
With \fB\-E\fR, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`#ifdef\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`#error\*(C'\fR.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the \fB\-dD\fR option is
implicitly enabled.
.Sp
With \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_LINE_\|_\*(C'\fR, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
With both \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, the rules for
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the

.IP "\fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR[\fB=\fR\fIlevel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]"
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The \fIlevel\fR parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value \fB0\fR of \fIlevel\fR de-activates
this option just as if no \fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR was present
on the command line. Value \fB1\fR tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value \fB2\fR tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is

.IX Item "-finput-charset=charset"
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by \s-1GCC. \s0 If the
locale does not specify, or \s-1GCC\s0 cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 This can be overridden by either the locale

supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives are emitted whatsoever.

Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output

along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a

source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.

Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is

In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro

.SS "Options for Linking"

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l library"
.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
.Sp
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Normally the files found this way are library files\-\-\-archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an \fB\-l\fR option and specifying a file name
is that \fB\-l\fR surrounds \fIlibrary\fR with \fBlib\fR and \fB.a\fR
and searches several directories.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostartfiles"
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as \f(CW\*(C`\-static\-libgcc\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-shared\-libgcc\*(C'\fR, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-static\-libgcc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-shared\-libgcc\*(C'\fR, are ignored.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
which \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is \fB_\|_main\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors are called.)
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a position independent executable on targets that support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
.IP "\fB\-rdynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rdynamic"
Pass the flag \fB\-export\-dynamic\fR to the \s-1ELF\s0 linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.[1]
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ and \s-1GCJ\s0 drivers automatically add
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because \*(C+ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it links the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or \s-1GCJ\s0 driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libasan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libasan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibasan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibasan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibasan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libasan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibasan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libtsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libtsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibtsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibtsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibtsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libtsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibtsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-liblsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-liblsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=leak\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBliblsan\fR.  If
\&\fIliblsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIliblsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-liblsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIliblsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libubsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libubsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=undefined\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibubsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibubsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibubsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libubsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibubsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libstdc++"
When the \fBg++\fR program is used to link a \*(C+ program, it
normally automatically links against \fBlibstdc++\fR.  If
\&\fIlibstdc++\fR is available as a shared library, and the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of \fIlibstdc++\fR.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of \fIlibstdc++\fR used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
\&\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR option directs the \fBg++\fR driver to
link \fIlibstdc++\fR statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T script"
Use \fIscript\fR as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the \fB\-T\fR option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.Sp
When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the \fIoption\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map=output.map\fR rather than
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map \-Xlinker output.map\fR.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, \fB\-Wl,\-Map,output.map\fR passes \fB\-Map output.map\fR to the
linker.  When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, you can also get the same effect with
\&\fB\-Wl,\-Map=output.map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u symbol"
Pretend the symbol \fIsymbol\fR is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use \fB\-u\fR multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
.SS "Options for Directory Search"
.IX Subsection "Options for Directory Search"
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
.IP "\fB\-I\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Idir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use \fB\-isystem\fR for that).  If you use more than
one \fB\-I\fR option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the \f(CW\*(C`include_next\*(C'\fR directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the \fB\-nostdinc\fR and/or \fB\-isystem\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-iplugindir=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iplugindir=dir"
Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by \fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIname\fR instead of
\&\fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIpath\fR\fB/\fR\fIname\fR\fB.so\fR.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.
.IP "\fB\-iquote\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iquotedir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of \fB#include
"\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR; they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR,
otherwise just like \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fBcpp\fR, \fBcc1\fR, \fBas\fR and \fBld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler checks to see if the path provided by the \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The runtime support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults which the \fBgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fBcc1\fR,
\&\fBcc1plus\fR, \fBas\fR, \fBld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.IP "\fB\-\-sysroot=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sysroot=dir"
Use \fIdir\fR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
\&\fI/usr/include\fR and libraries in \fI/usr/lib\fR, it instead
searches \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR and \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/lib\fR.
.Sp
If you use both this option and the \fB\-isysroot\fR option, then
the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option applies to libraries, but the
\&\fB\-isysroot\fR option applies to header files.
.Sp
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of \fB\-\-sysroot\fR still works, but the
library aspect does not.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sysroot\-suffix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sysroot-suffix"
For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with \fB\-\-sysroot\fR, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/\fIsuffix\fI/usr/include\fR instead of
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.
.IP "\fB\-I\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
This option has been deprecated.  Please use \fB\-iquote\fR instead for
\&\fB\-I\fR directories before the \fB\-I\-\fR and remove the \fB\-I\-\fR.
Any directories you specify with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I\-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I\-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.  (Ordinarily \fIall\fR \fB\-I\fR directories are used
this way.)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I\-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.  There is no way to
override this effect of \fB\-I\-\fR.  With \fB\-I.\fR you can specify
searching the directory that is current when the compiler is
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-I\-\fR does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, \fB\-I\-\fR and \fB\-nostdinc\fR are
independent.
.SS "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
.IX Subsection "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fBgcc\fR, or

hardware models or configurations\-\-\-for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.
.PP
Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.
.PP
\fIAArch64 Options\fR
.IX Subsection "AArch64 Options"
.PP
These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible values

are 32\-bit, and \fBlp64\fR for SysV-like data model where int is 32\-bit,
but long int and pointer are 64\-bit.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the \s-1LP64\s0 and \s-1ILP32\s0 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your
entire program with the same \s-1ABI,\s0 and link with a compatible set of libraries.

\fIAdapteva Epiphany Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Adapteva Epiphany Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:
.IP "\fB\-mhalf\-reg\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhalf-reg-file"
Don't allocate any register in the range \f(CW\*(C`r32\*(C'\fR...\f(CW\*(C`r63\*(C'\fR.
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.
.IP "\fB\-mprefer\-short\-insn\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mprefer-short-insn-regs"
Preferrentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.
.IP "\fB\-mbranch\-cost=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbranch-cost=num"
Set the cost of branches to roughly \fInum\fR \*(L"simple\*(R" instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.
.IP "\fB\-mcmove\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmove"
Enable the generation of conditional moves.
.IP "\fB\-mnops=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mnops=num"
Emit \fInum\fR NOPs before every other generated instruction.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-cmpsf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-cmpsf"
For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an \f(CW\*(C`fsub\*(C'\fR instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is \fB\-msoft\-cmpsf\fR, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.
.IP "\fB\-mstack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstack-offset=num"
Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range \f(CW\*(C`sp+0...sp+7\*(C'\fR
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
Values other than \fB8\fR or \fB16\fR are untested and unlikely to work.
Note also that this option changes the \s-1ABI\s0; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work.
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate \fB\-\-with\-stack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-round\-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-round-nearest"
Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is \fB\-mround\-nearest\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mshort\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mshort-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR.
.IP "\fB\-msmall16\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall16"
Assume addresses can be loaded as 16\-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR semantics
are in effect.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-mode=\fR\fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-mode=mode"
Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.
.Sp
\&\fImode\fR can be set to one the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBcaller\fR" 4
.IX Item "caller"
Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 mode.
.IP "\fBtruncate\fR" 4
.IX Item "truncate"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.
.IP "\fBround-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "round-nearest"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.
.IP "\fBint\fR" 4
.IX Item "int"
This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the \s-1FPU,\s0 e.g.
integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.

.IP "\fB\-mnovect\-double\fR" 4

Change the preferred \s-1SIMD\s0 mode to SImode.  The default is
\&\fB\-mvect\-double\fR, which uses DImode as preferred \s-1SIMD\s0 mode.
.IP "\fB\-max\-vect\-align=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-max-vect-align=num"
The maximum alignment for \s-1SIMD\s0 vector mode types.
\&\fInum\fR may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8.
Note that this is an \s-1ABI\s0 change, even though many library function
interfaces are unaffected if they don't use \s-1SIMD\s0 vector modes
in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.
.IP "\fB\-msplit\-vecmove\-early\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msplit-vecmove-early"
Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory this
can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
generally the case.
.IP "\fB\-m1reg\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m1reg-reg"
Specify a register to hold the constant \-1, which makes loading small negative
constants and certain bitmasks faster.
Allowable values for \fIreg\fR are \fBr43\fR and \fBr63\fR,
which specify use of that register as a fixed register,

Generate call insns as register indirect calls, thus providing access
to the full 32\-bit address range.
.IP "\fB\-mmedium\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmedium-calls"
Don't use less than 25 bit addressing range for calls, which is the
offset available for an unconditional branch-and-link
instruction.  Conditional execution of function calls is suppressed, to
allow use of the 25\-bit range, rather than the 21\-bit range with
conditional branch-and-link.  This is the default for tool chains built

generation driven by the combiner pass.
.IP "\fB\-mcase\-vector\-pcrel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcase-vector-pcrel"
Use pc-relative switch case tables \- this enables case table shortening.
This is the default for \fB\-Os\fR.

Enable compact casesi pattern.
This is the default for \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-cond\-exec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-cond-exec"
Disable ARCompact specific pass to generate conditional execution instructions.
Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand numbers,
literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support for conditional execution,
the target-independent pass to generate conditional execution is often lacking,
so the \s-1ARC\s0 port has kept a special pass around that tries to find more
conditional execution generating opportunities after register allocation,
branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have been done.  This pass
generally, but not always, improves performance and code size, at the cost of
extra compilation time, which is why there is an option to switch it off.
If you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable
offset range because they are conditionalized, you should consider using
\&\fB\-mmedium\-calls\fR instead.
.IP "\fB\-mearly\-cbranchsi\fR" 4

.IX Item "-mlra-priority-noncompact"
Reduce target regsiter priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-millicode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-millicode"
When optimizing for size (using \fB\-Os\fR), prologues and epilogues
that have to save or restore a large number of registers are often
shortened by using call to a special function in libgcc; this is
referred to as a \fImillicode\fR call.  As these calls can pose
performance issues, and/or cause linking issues when linking in a
nonstandard way, this option is provided to turn off millicode call
generation.
.IP "\fB\-mmixed\-code\fR" 4

These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Advanced \s-1RISC\s0 Machines (\s-1ARM\s0)
architectures:
.IP "\fB\-mabi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabi=name"
Generate code for the specified \s-1ABI. \s0 Permissible values are: \fBapcs-gnu\fR,
\&\fBatpcs\fR, \fBaapcs\fR, \fBaapcs-linux\fR and \fBiwmmxt\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the \s-1ARM\s0 Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying \fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs"
This is a synonym for \fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mthumb-interwork"
Generate code that supports calling between the \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre\-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is \fB\-mno\-thumb\-interwork\fR, since slightly larger code
is generated when \fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR is specified.  In \s-1AAPCS\s0
configurations this option is meaningless.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-sched\-prolog\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-sched-prolog"
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is \fB\-msched\-prolog\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfloat\-abi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfloat-abi=name"
Specifies which floating-point \s-1ABI\s0 to use.  Permissible values
are: \fBsoft\fR, \fBsoftfp\fR and \fBhard\fR.
.Sp
Specifying \fBsoft\fR causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
\&\fBsoftfp\fR allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
\&\fBhard\fR allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same \s-1ABI,\s0 and link with a
compatible set of libraries.
.IP "\fB\-mlittle\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlittle-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
.IP "\fB\-mbig\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbig-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
.IP "\fB\-mwords\-little\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mwords-little-endian"
This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form \fB32107654\fR.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian \s-1ARM\s0 processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.  This option is now deprecated.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.  Permissible names are: \fBarmv2\fR,
\&\fBarmv2a\fR, \fBarmv3\fR, \fBarmv3m\fR, \fBarmv4\fR, \fBarmv4t\fR,

\&\fB\-march=armv7ve\fR is the armv7\-a architecture with virtualization

\&\fB\-march=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the architecture
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect

.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=name"
This option specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor for
which \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the performance of the code.
For some \s-1ARM\s0 implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.
Permissible names are: \fBarm2\fR, \fBarm250\fR,

.Sp
Additionally, this option can specify that \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the performance
of the code for a big.LITTLE system.  Permissible names are:
\&\fBcortex\-a15.cortex\-a7\fR, \fBcortex\-a57.cortex\-a53\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the
performance for a blend of processors within architecture \fIarch\fR.
The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular
processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the
range, and avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of
this option may change in future \s-1GCC\s0 versions as \s-1CPU\s0 models come and go.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the \s-1CPU\s0
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect is
unsuccessful the option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this name
to derive the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture (as if specified
by \fB\-march\fR) and the \s-1ARM\s0 processor type for which to tune for
performance (as if specified by \fB\-mtune\fR).  Where this option
is used in conjunction with \fB\-march\fR or \fB\-mtune\fR,
those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.
.Sp
Permissible names for this option are the same as those for
\&\fB\-mtune\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR is also permissible, and is
equivalent to \fB\-march=\fR\fIarch\fR \fB\-mtune=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR.
See \fB\-mtune\fR for more information.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the \s-1CPU\s0
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect
is unsuccessful the option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-mfpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfpu=name"
This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: \fBvfp\fR, \fBvfpv3\fR,
\&\fBvfpv3\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv3\-d16\fR, \fBvfpv3\-d16\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv3xd\fR,
\&\fBvfpv3xd\-fp16\fR, \fBneon\fR, \fBneon\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv4\fR,
\&\fBvfpv4\-d16\fR, \fBfpv4\-sp\-d16\fR, \fBneon\-vfpv4\fR,
\&\fBfp\-armv8\fR, \fBneon\-fp\-armv8\fR, and \fBcrypto\-neon\-fp\-armv8\fR.
.Sp
If \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified this specifies the format of
floating-point values.
.Sp
If the selected floating-point hardware includes the \s-1NEON\s0 extension
(e.g. \fB\-mfpu\fR=\fBneon\fR), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by \s-1GCC\s0's auto-vectorization pass unless
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR is also specified.  This is
because \s-1NEON\s0 hardware does not fully implement the \s-1IEEE 754\s0 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of \s-1NEON\s0 instructions may lead to a loss of precision.
.IP "\fB\-mfp16\-format=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp16-format=name"
Specify the format of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR half-precision floating-point type.
Permissible names are \fBnone\fR, \fBieee\fR, and \fBalternative\fR;
the default is \fBnone\fR, in which case the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR type is not
defined.
.IP "\fB\-mstructure\-size\-boundary=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstructure-size-boundary=n"
The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the \s-1COFF\s0
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying \s-1ABI\s0 supports it.
.Sp
Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.
.IP "\fB\-mabort\-on\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabort-on-noreturn"
Generate a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR at the end of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR function.  It is executed if the function tries to
return.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64\-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the \fBshort-call\fR attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a \fB#pragma no_long_calls\fR directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the \fBlong-call\fR
attribute or the \fBsection\fR attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a \fB#pragma long_calls\fR directive are always
turned into long calls.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a \fB#pragma
long_calls_off\fR directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
.IP "\fB\-msingle\-pic\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msingle-pic-base"
Treat the register used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-register=reg"
Specify the register to be used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing.
For standard \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default will be any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default is
\&\fBR9\fR if target is \s-1EABI\s0 based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is \fBR10\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-data\-is\-text\-relative\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-data-is-text-relative"
Assume that each data segments are relative to text segment at load time.
Therefore, it permits addressing data using PC-relative operations.
This option is on by default for targets other than VxWorks \s-1RTP.\s0
.IP "\fB\-mpoke\-function\-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpoke-function-name"
Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&             t0
\&                 .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
\&                 .align

.Sp
When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`pc\*(C'\fR stored at \f(CW\*(C`fp + 0\*(C'\fR.  If the trace function then looks at
location \f(CW\*(C`pc \- 12\*(C'\fR and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length \f(CW\*(C`((pc[\-3]) & 0xff000000)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mthumb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mthumb"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-marm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-marm"
.PD
Select between generating code that executes in \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb
states.  The default for most configurations is to generate code
that executes in \s-1ARM\s0 state, but the default can be changed by
configuring \s-1GCC\s0 with the \fB\-\-with\-mode=\fR\fIstate\fR
configure option.
.IP "\fB\-mtpcs\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtpcs-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is \fB\-mno\-tpcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mtpcs\-leaf\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtpcs-leaf-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-leaf\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mcallee\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcallee-super-interworking"
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an \s-1ARM\s0
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in \s-1AAPCS\s0 configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-mcaller\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcaller-super-interworking"
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in \s-1AAPCS\s0 configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.
.IP "\fB\-mtp=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtp=name"
Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are \fBsoft\fR, which generates calls to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_aeabi_read_tp\*(C'\fR,
\&\fBcp15\fR, which fetches the thread pointer from \f(CW\*(C`cp15\*(C'\fR directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and \fBauto\fR, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
\&\fBauto\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mtls\-dialect=\fR\fIdialect\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtls-dialect=dialect"
Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
\&\fIdialect\fRs are supported\-\-\-\fBgnu\fR and \fBgnu2\fR.  The
\&\fBgnu\fR dialect selects the original \s-1GNU\s0 scheme for supporting
local and global dynamic \s-1TLS\s0 models.  The \fBgnu2\fR dialect
selects the \s-1GNU\s0 descriptor scheme, which provides better performance
for shared libraries.  The \s-1GNU\s0 descriptor scheme is compatible with
the original scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and
library support.  Initial and local exec \s-1TLS\s0 models are unaffected by
this option and always use the original scheme.
.IP "\fB\-mword\-relocations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mword-relocations"
Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32).
This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR
is specified.
.IP "\fB\-mfix\-cortex\-m3\-ldrd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd"
Some Cortex\-M3 cores can cause data corruption when \f(CW\*(C`ldrd\*(C'\fR instructions
with overlapping destination and base registers are used.  This option avoids

Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16\- and 32\- bit values
from addresses that are not 16\- or 32\- bit aligned.  By default
unaligned access is disabled for all pre\-ARMv6 and all ARMv6\-M
architectures, and enabled for all other architectures.  If unaligned
access is not enabled then words in packed data structures will be
accessed a byte at a time.

Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release the needed

Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on

executables because arguments need not to be removed from the

Setting \f(CW\*(C`\-mrelax\*(C'\fR just adds the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-relax\*(C'\fR option to the
linker command line when the linker is called.
.Sp
Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are not
known before code is located. Therefore, the assembler code generated by the
compiler is the same, but the instructions in the executable may
differ from instructions in the assembler code.
.Sp
Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see the

Treat the stack pointer register as an 8\-bit register,
i.e. assume the high byte of the stack pointer is zero.
In general, you don't need to set this option by hand.
.Sp
This option is used internally by the compiler to select and
build multilibs for architectures \f(CW\*(C`avr2\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`avr25\*(C'\fR.
These architectures mix devices with and without \f(CW\*(C`SPH\*(C'\fR.
For any setting other than \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=avr2\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=avr25\*(C'\fR
the compiler driver will add or remove this option from the compiler
proper's command line, because the compiler then knows if the device
or architecture has an 8\-bit stack pointer and thus no \f(CW\*(C`SPH\*(C'\fR
register or not.
.IP "\fB\-mstrict\-X\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstrict-X"
Use address register \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR in a way proposed by the hardware.  This means
that \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR is only used in indirect, post-increment or
pre-decrement addressing.
.Sp
Without this option, the \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR register may be used in the same way

\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash
.IX Subsection "EIND and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash"
.PP
Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64@tie{}Ki words.
.PP
In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
\&\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR that serves as most significant part of the target address
when \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR instructions are used.
.PP
Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR implicitely in \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR
instructions or might read \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a \f(CW\*(C`RET\*(C'\fR instruction.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler assumes that \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates \fIstubs\fR. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
\&\fItrampolines\fR. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker will generate
the stubs correctly an all situaltion. See the compiler option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-mrelax\*(C'\fR and the linler option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-relax\*(C'\fR.
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The default linker script is arranged for code with \f(CW\*(C`EIND = 0\*(C'\fR.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with \f(CW\*(C`EIND != 0\*(C'\fR, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with \f(CW\*(C`.trampolines\*(C'\fR into the segment where \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
points to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The startup code from libgcc never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
For the impact of AVR-LibC on \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR, see the
AVR-LibC\ user\ manual (\f(CW\*(C`http://nongnu.org/avr\-libc/user\-manual/\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section \f(CW\*(C`.init3\*(C'\fR. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes \s-1RAM\s0 and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR to the segment
where the vector table is located.

Some \s-1AVR\s0 devices support memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range
that can be accessed with 16\-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the contentent of a \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR
register is used as high part of the address:
The \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR address register is concatenated
with the \f(CW\*(C`RAMPX\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPY\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,

the simulator \s-1BSP\s0 provided by libgloss to be linked in.  This option
has effect only for \fBbfin-elf\fR toolchain.
Certain other options, such as \fB\-mid\-shared\-library\fR and
\&\fB\-mfdpic\fR, imply \fB\-msim\fR.
.IP "\fB\-momit\-leaf\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-momit-leaf-frame-pointer"
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
\&\fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR removes the frame pointer for all functions,
which might make debugging harder.
.IP "\fB\-mspecld\-anomaly\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mspecld-anomaly"
When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
contain speculative loads after jump instructions. If this option is used,

.IP "\fB\-mlow\-64k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlow-64k"
When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the knowledge that
the entire program fits into the low 64k of memory.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-low\-64k\fR" 4

Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad memory by the
uClinux kernel.
.IP "\fB\-mid\-shared\-library\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mid-shared-library"
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library \s-1ID\s0 method.
This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies \fB\-fPIC\fR.
With a \fBbfin-elf\fR target, this option implies \fB\-msim\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-id\-shared\-library\fR" 4

Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mleaf\-id\-shared\-library\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mleaf-id-shared-library"
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library \s-1ID\s0 method,
but assumes that this library or executable won't link against any other
\&\s-1ID\s0 shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps
and calls.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-leaf\-id\-shared\-library\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-leaf-id-shared-library"
Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any \s-1ID\s0 shared
libraries.  Slower code is generated for jump and call insns.
.IP "\fB\-mshared\-library\-id=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mshared-library-id=n"
Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library but is no more space\- or time-efficient than omitting this option.
.IP "\fB\-msep\-data\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msep-data"
Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute in place in
an environment without virtual memory management by eliminating relocations
against the text section.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-sep\-data\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 24\-bit addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR restores the default behavior.  Note these
switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
function calls via function pointers.
.IP "\fB\-mfast\-fp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfast-fp"
Link with the fast floating-point library. This library relaxes some of
the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating-point standard's rules for checking inputs against
Not-a-Number (\s-1NAN\s0), in the interest of performance.
.IP "\fB\-minline\-plt\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mmulticore\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmulticore"
Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin processors. 
This option causes proper start files and link scripts supporting

The loader should initialize \s-1SDRAM\s0 before loading the application.
.IP "\fB\-micplb\fR" 4

\fIDarwin Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Darwin Options"
.PP
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
.PP
\&\s-1FSF GCC\s0 on Darwin does not create \*(L"fat\*(R" object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that \s-1GCC\s0 was built to
target.  Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does create \*(L"fat\*(R" files if multiple
\&\fB\-arch\fR options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
\&\fIlipo\fR.
.PP
The subtype of the file created (like \fBppc7400\fR or \fBppc970\fR or
\&\fBi686\fR) is determined by the flags that specify the \s-1ISA\s0
that \s-1GCC\s0 is targeting, like \fB\-mcpu\fR or \fB\-march\fR.  The
\&\fB\-force_cpusubtype_ALL\fR option can be used to override this.
.PP
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an \s-1ISA\s0
mismatch.  The assembler, \fIas\fR, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64\-bit instructions in a \fBppc750\fR object file.
The linker for shared libraries, \fI/usr/bin/libtool\fR, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a \fBppc970\fR object file in a \fBppc7400\fR library).  The linker
for executables, \fBld\fR, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Fdir"
Add the framework directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by \fB\-I\fR options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.
.Sp
A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a \fIHeaders\fR and/or
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR directory contained directly in it that ends
in \fI.framework\fR.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the \fI.framework\fR.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
\&\fIHeaders\fR being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's \fIFrameworks\fR directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in \fI/System/Library/Frameworks\fR and
\&\fI/Library/Frameworks\fR.  An example include looks like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include <Framework/header.h>\*(C'\fR, where \fIFramework\fR denotes
the name of the framework and \fIheader.h\fR is found in the
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR or \fIHeaders\fR directory.
.IP "\fB\-iframework\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iframeworkdir"
Like \fB\-F\fR except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this \fB\-iframework\fR and
\&\fB\-F\fR is that with \fB\-iframework\fR the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
\&\fIdir\fR.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.
.IP "\fB\-gused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gused"
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
debugging format, this enables \fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR.
This is by default \s-1ON.\s0
.IP "\fB\-gfull\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gfull"
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.
.IP "\fB\-mmacosx\-version\-min=\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmacosx-version-min=version"
The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
is \fIversion\fR.  Typical values of \fIversion\fR include \f(CW10.1\fR,
\&\f(CW10.2\fR, and \f(CW10.3.9\fR.
.Sp
If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.
.IP "\fB\-mkernel\fR" 4

\&\fB\-fapple\-kext\fR, \fB\-fno\-weak\fR and \fB\-fno\-rtti\fR where
applicable.  This mode also sets \fB\-mno\-altivec\fR,
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR, \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR and
\&\fB\-mlong\-branch\fR for PowerPC targets.
.IP "\fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mone-byte-bool"
Override the defaults for \fBbool\fR so that \fBsizeof(bool)==1\fR.
By default \fBsizeof(bool)\fR is \fB4\fR when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and \fB1\fR when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR The \fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this

\fI\s-1DEC\s0 Alpha Options\fR
.IX Subsection "DEC Alpha Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for the \s-1DEC\s0 Alpha implementations:
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-float"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified,
functions in \fIlibgcc.a\fR are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.
.Sp
Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-reg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-regs"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR implies \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in \f(CW$0\fR instead of \f(CW$f0\fR.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with \fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR must also be compiled with that
option.
.Sp
A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee"
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
\&\fIexcept\fR that the \fIinexact-flag\fR is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional \s-1IEEE\s0
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option \fB\-ieee_with_no_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-with\-inexact\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-with-inexact"
This is like \fB\-mieee\fR except the generated code also maintains
the \s-1IEEE \s0\fIinexact-flag\fR.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant \s-1IEEE\s0 math.  In addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP_EXACT\*(C'\fR is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the \fIinexact-flag\fR, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option \fB\-ieee_with_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=\fR\fItrap-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode"
This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
Other Alpha compilers call this option \fB\-fptm\fR \fItrap-mode\fR.
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).
.IP "\fBu\fR" 4
.IX Item "u"
In addition to the traps enabled by \fBn\fR, underflow traps are enabled
as well.
.IP "\fBsu\fR" 4
.IX Item "su"
Like \fBu\fR, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).
.IP "\fBsui\fR" 4
.IX Item "sui"
Like \fBsu\fR, but inexact traps are enabled as well.
.RE

.IP "\fB\-mfp\-rounding\-mode=\fR\fIrounding-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-rounding-mode=rounding-mode"
Selects the \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
\&\fB\-fprm\fR \fIrounding-mode\fR.  The \fIrounding-mode\fR can be one
of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Normal \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.
.IP "\fBm\fR" 4
.IX Item "m"
Round towards minus infinity.
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(\fIfpcr\fR, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
\&\fIfpcr\fR, \fBd\fR corresponds to round towards plus infinity.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-mtrap\-precision=\fR\fItrap-precision\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtrap-precision=trap-precision"
In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "p"
Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBi\fR" 4
.IX Item "i"
Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
\&\fB\-scope_safe\fR and \fB\-resumption_safe\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-conformant\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-conformant"
This option marks the generated code as \s-1IEEE\s0 conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify \fB\-mtrap\-precision=i\fR and either
\&\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=su\fR or \fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=sui\fR.  Its only effect
is to emit the line \fB.eflag 48\fR in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.
.IP "\fB\-mbuild\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbuild-constants"
Normally \s-1GCC\s0 examines a 32\- or 64\-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.
.Sp
Use this option to require \s-1GCC\s0 to construct \fIall\fR integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).
.Sp
You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

Indicate whether \s-1GCC\s0 should generate code to use the optional \s-1BWX,
CIX, FIX\s0 and \s-1MAX\s0 instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction
sets supported by the \s-1CPU\s0 type specified via \fB\-mcpu=\fR option or that

.IX Item "-mexplicit-relocs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-explicit\-relocs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-explicit-relocs"
.PD
Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  \s-1GNU\s0 binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as \s-1GCC\s0 detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.
.IP "\fB\-msmall\-data\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall-data"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mlarge\-data\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlarge-data"
.PD
When \fB\-mexplicit\-relocs\fR is in effect, static data is
accessed via \fIgp-relative\fR relocations.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a \fIsmall data area\fR
(the \f(CW\*(C`.sdata\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.sbss\*(C'\fR sections) and are accessed via
16\-bit relocations off of the \f(CW$gp\fR register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.
.Sp
When generating code for shared libraries, \fB\-fpic\fR implies
\&\fB\-msmall\-data\fR and \fB\-fPIC\fR implies \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.
.IP "\fB\-msmall\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall-text"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mlarge\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlarge-text"
.PD
When \fB\-msmall\-text\fR is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same \f(CW$gp\fR value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-text\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=cpu_type"
Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type \fIcpu_type\fR.  You can specify either the \fB\s-1EV\s0\fR
style name or the corresponding chip number.  \s-1GCC\s0 supports scheduling
parameters for the \s-1EV4, EV5\s0 and \s-1EV6\s0 family of processors and
chooses the default values for the instruction set from the processor
you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, \s-1GCC\s0 defaults

Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.
.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-fpregs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-fpregs"
Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context switching of
floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.
.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-indexing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-indexing"
Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling \s-1MIG\s0 generated code under \s-1MACH.\s0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-space\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-space-regs"
Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.
.Sp
Such code is suitable for level 0 \s-1PA\s0 systems and kernels.
.IP "\fB\-mfast\-indirect\-calls\fR" 4

.Sp
This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.
.IP "\fB\-mfixed\-range=\fR\fIregister-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfixed-range=register-range"
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-load\-store\fR" 4

\&\fB7100\fR, \fB7100LC\fR, \fB7200\fR, \fB7300\fR and \fB8000\fR.  Refer
to \fI/usr/lib/sched.models\fR on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
\&\fB8000\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlinker\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlinker-opt"
Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1HPPA\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC,\s0 with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-msio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msio"
Generate the predefine, \f(CW\*(C`_SIO\*(C'\fR, for server \s-1IO. \s0 The default is
\&\fB\-mwsio\fR.  This generates the predefines, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_hp9000s700\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_hp9000s700_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_WSIO\*(C'\fR, for workstation \s-1IO. \s0 These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.
.IP "\fB\-mgnu\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgnu-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1GNU \s0\fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-shared\fR to \fBld\fR when
building a shared library.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  This option does not
affect which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that \fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the
\&\fB\-\-with\-ld\fR configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and
finally by the user's \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed
using \fBwhich `gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available
on the 64\-bit HP-UX \s-1GCC,\s0 i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mhp\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhp-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1HP \s0\fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-b\fR to \fBld\fR when building
a shared library and passes \fB+Accept TypeMismatch\fR to \fBld\fR on all
links.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the \s-1HP\s0 linker.  This option does not affect
which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
\&\fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the \fB\-\-with\-ld\fR
configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and finally by the user's
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed using \fBwhich
`gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available on the 64\-bit
HP-UX \s-1GCC,\s0 i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
\&\s-1PA 2.0\s0 and \s-1PA 1.X\s0 architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.
.Sp
Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
\&\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR option, or when using the \fB\-mgas\fR
and \fB\-mno\-portable\-runtime\fR options together under HP-UX with
the \s-1SOM\s0 linker.
.Sp
It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.
.Sp
The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
.IP "\fB\-munix=\fR\fIunix-std\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munix=unix-std"
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 standard.  The choices for \fIunix-std\fR are \fB93\fR, \fB95\fR
and \fB98\fR.  \fB93\fR is supported on all HP-UX versions.  \fB95\fR
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  \fB98\fR is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are \fB93\fR for HP-UX 10.00,
\&\fB95\fR for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and \fB98\fR for HP-UX 11.11
and later.
.Sp
\&\fB\-munix=93\fR provides the same predefines as \s-1GCC 3.3\s0 and 3.4.
\&\fB\-munix=95\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix95.o\fR.
\&\fB\-munix=98\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_\|_STDC_A1_SOURCE\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix98.o\fR.
.Sp
It is \fIimportant\fR to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, \fIextreme\fR care is needed in using this
option.
.Sp
Library code that is intended to operate with more than one \s-1UNIX\s0
standard must test, set and restore the variable \fI_\|_xpg4_extended_mask\fR
as appropriate.  Most \s-1GNU\s0 software doesn't provide this capability.
.IP "\fB\-nolibdld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nolibdld"
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.
.Sp
On HP-UX 10 and later, the \s-1GCC\s0 driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64\-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
\&\fB\-nolibdld\fR option can be used to prevent the \s-1GCC\s0 driver from
adding these link options.
.IP "\fB\-threads\fR" 4

.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

These options enable \s-1GCC\s0 to use these extended instructions in

.IP "\fB\-mcld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcld"
This option instructs \s-1GCC\s0 to emit a \f(CW\*(C`cld\*(C'\fR instruction in the prologue
of functions that use string instructions.  String instructions depend on
the \s-1DF\s0 flag to select between autoincrement or autodecrement mode.  While the
\&\s-1ABI\s0 specifies the \s-1DF\s0 flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
systems violate this specification by not clearing the \s-1DF\s0 flag in their
exception dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the \s-1DF\s0 flag
set, which leads to wrong direction mode when string instructions are used.
This option can be enabled by default on 32\-bit x86 targets by configuring
\&\s-1GCC\s0 with the \fB\-\-enable\-cld\fR configure option.  Generation of \f(CW\*(C`cld\*(C'\fR

.IP "\fB\-msahf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msahf"
This option enables generation of \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instructions in 64\-bit code.
Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64 support,

lacked the \f(CW\*(C`LAHF\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instructions
which were supported by \s-1AMD64.\s0
These are load and store instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.
In 64\-bit mode, the \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instruction is used to optimize \f(CW\*(C`fmod\*(C'\fR,

to increase precision instead of \f(CW\*(C`DIVSS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SQRTSS\*(C'\fR

variants) for single-precision floating-point arguments.  These instructions
are generated only when \fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR is enabled
together with \fB\-finite\-math\-only\fR and \fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR.
Note that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).

Use \s-1PUSH\s0 operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter

improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-maccumulate\-outgoing\-args\fR" 4
.IX Item "-maccumulate-outgoing-args"
If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments is
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs
because of reduced dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage

processors, this option is not needed; \fB\-fPIC\fR suffices.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT.\s0
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
\&\fB\-mxgot\fR is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.
.Sp
These options have no effect unless \s-1GCC\s0 is generating
position-independent code.

\&\fBmips1\fR for 32\-bit ABIs and \fBmips3\fR for 64\-bit ABIs).
.Sp
The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value \fBnative\fR,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
\&\fB\-march=native\fR has no effect if \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize
the processor.
.Sp
In processor names, a final \fB000\fR can be abbreviated as \fBk\fR
(for example, \fB\-march=r2k\fR).  Prefixes are optional, and
\&\fBvr\fR may be written \fBr\fR.
.Sp
Names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
\&\fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf3_2\fR refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, \fIn\fR\fBf\fR is accepted as a synonym
for \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR while \fIn\fR\fBx\fR and \fIb\fR\fBfx\fR are
accepted as synonyms for \fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form \fB_MIPS_ARCH_\fR\fIfoo\fR,
where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR sets \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR
to \fB\*(L"r2000\*(R"\fR and defines the macro \fB_MIPS_ARCH_R2000\fR.
.Sp
Note that the \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate \fB000\fR as \fBk\fR.  In the case of \fBfrom-abi\fR,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either \fB\*(L"mips1\*(R"\fR or
\&\fB\*(L"mips3\*(R"\fR).  It names the default architecture when no
\&\fB\-march\fR option is given.

When this option is not used, \s-1GCC\s0 optimizes for the processor

All \fB\-mabicalls\fR code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like \fB\-fPIC\fR and \fB\-fpic\fR.  However,
as an extension, the \s-1GNU\s0 toolchain allows executables to use absolute

\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT.\s0
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

.IP "\fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting"
Specify whether \s-1GCC\s0 should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.
.Sp
In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the \*(L"taken\*(R" branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.
.Sp
This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a \s-1DMA\s0 operation writes to the
same area of memory before the \*(L"dirty\*(R" line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.
.Sp
One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  \fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR
controls \s-1GCC\s0's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;
.IP "2." 4
the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;
.IP "3." 4
the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.
.Sp
If the input program contains a function declaration such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        void foo (void);
.Ve
.Sp
then the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR must allow \f(CW\*(C`j foo\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`jal foo\*(C'\fR to be executed speculatively.  \s-1GCC\s0 honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.
.Sp
The option has three forms:
.IP "\fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=load\-store\fR" 4

When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally safe

warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the \s-1MAC AE\s0 type.  The \s-1MAC AE\s0 has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate
that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an \s-1AE\s0 type that has the necessary hardware support.  This option disables
these warnings.

Modify generation of the \s-1TOC \s0(Table Of Contents), which is created for

each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  \s-1GCC\s0
also places floating-point constants in the \s-1TOC. \s0 However, only

\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run time instead of putting that sum into the \s-1TOC. \s0 You may specify one

If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of
these options, specify \fB\-mminimal\-toc\fR instead.  This option causes
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to make only one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for every file.  When you specify this

By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call is generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the \f(CW\*(C`shortcall\*(C'\fR function attribute, or by \f(CW\*(C`#pragma
longcall(0)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the \s-1AIX\s0 linker can do this,
as can the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for 32\-bit PowerPC systems as well.

On Darwin/PPC systems, \f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall\*(C'\fR generates \f(CW\*(C`jbsr
callee, L42\*(C'\fR, plus a \fIbranch island\fR (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a \f(CW\*(C`bl
callee\*(C'\fR if the \s-1PPC \s0\f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates \f(CW\*(C`bl L42\*(C'\fR to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32\-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.
.Sp
On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.

.IX Item "-msmall-data-limit=N"
Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the \s-1RX\s0's
registers (usually \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register.
.Sp
Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.
.Sp
The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(\fB\-O2\fR etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the

.IX Item "-mmax-constant-size=N"
Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a \s-1RX\s0 instruction.  Although the \s-1RX\s0 instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.
.Sp
The value \fIN\fR can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)

.IX Item "-mint-register=N"
Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value \fIN\fR can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR is reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`r12\*(C'\fR.  A value of 3 reserves \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`r12\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`r11\*(C'\fR, and a value of 4 reserves \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR through \f(CW\*(C`r10\*(C'\fR.
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.
.IP "\fB\-msave\-acc\-in\-interrupts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msave-acc-in-interrupts"
Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64\-bit

.PD
Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.
.Sp
Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.
.Sp
The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the \fB\-msmall\-data\-limit\fR and/or the
\&\fB\-mint\-register\fR command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of \fB\-mint\-register\fR,
then \fB\-mpid\fR and finally \fB\-msmall\-data\-limit\fR.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be \f(CW\*(C`r8\*(C'\fR if both
\&\fB\-mint\-register=4\fR and \fB\-mpid\fR are specified on the
command line.

Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer

A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
\&\s-1DWARF 2\s0 call frame information.
When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored

save area.
.Sp
In general, code compiled with \fB\-mbackchain\fR is call-compatible with

Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is

area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when \fB\-mbackchain\fR is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.
.Sp
As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with

\&\fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR.  Note that some non-FSF releases of \s-1GCC 2.95\s0 for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR.  Also, note that the

.IP "\fBsoft-gusa\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-gusa"
Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic
built-in functions.  The generated atomic sequences require additional support
from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable
for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when
the target is \f(CW\*(C`sh*\-*\-linux*\*(C'\fR and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is \s-1SH4A,\s0
this option will also partially utilize the hardware atomic instructions
\&\f(CW\*(C`movli.l\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`movco.l\*(C'\fR to create more efficient code, unless
\&\fBstrict\fR is specified.
.IP "\fBsoft-tcb\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-tcb"
Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control
block.  This is a variation of the gUSA sequences which can also be used on
SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the \fBgbr\-offset=\fR

.IP "\fBsoft-imask\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-imask"
Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by
setting \f(CW\*(C`SR.IMASK = 1111\*(C'\fR.  This model works only when the program runs
in privileged mode and is only suitable for single-core systems.  Additional

Generate hardware atomic sequences using the \f(CW\*(C`movli.l\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`movco.l\*(C'\fR
instructions only.  This is only available on \s-1SH4A\s0 and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.
Code compiled with this option will also be compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an \s-1SH4A\s0
system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the

For SHmedia \fIstrategy\fR can be one of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBfp\fR" 4
.IX Item "fp"
Performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily-exploitable \s-1ILP\s0 to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating-point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBinv\fR" 4
.IX Item "inv"
Uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
\&\s-1CSE\s0 and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
.IP "\fBinv:minlat\fR" 4
.IX Item "inv:minlat"
A variant of \fBinv\fR where, if no \s-1CSE\s0 or hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
.IP "\fBcall\fR" 4
.IX Item "call"
Calls a library function that usually implements the \fBinv:minlat\fR
strategy.
This gives high code density for \f(CW\*(C`m5\-*media\-nofpu\*(C'\fR compilations.
.IP "\fBcall2\fR" 4
.IX Item "call2"
Uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it

Use the \fBinv\fR algorithm for initial
code generation, but if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the \fBcall\fR,
\&\fBcall2\fR, or \fBfp\fR strategies, respectively.  Note that the
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to floating-point operations or a call is not possible
in that case.

Variants of the \fBinv:minlat\fR strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation is not separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable)
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  \fBinv20u\fR assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and \fBinv20l\fR assumes it to be likely.

SH2A\s0 and SHcompact.
.IP "\fBcall-fp\fR" 4

floating point.  Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is

.IP "\fBcall-table\fR" 4
.IX Item "call-table"
Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and
the \f(CW\*(C`div1\*(C'\fR instruction with case distinction for larger divisors.  Division
by zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default

When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy will be

Set the name of the library function used for 32\-bit signed division to

.IP "\fB\-mindexed\-addressing\fR" 4

Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or \s-1OS\s0 implement 32\-bit wrap-around

implementation of processors with 64\-bit \s-1MMU,\s0 which the \s-1OS\s0 could use to
get 32\-bit addressing, but since no current hardware implementation supports
this or any other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in

.IP "\fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpt-fixed"
Assume \f(CW\*(C`pt*\*(C'\fR instructions won't trap.  This generally generates
better-scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.
The current architecture
definition says that \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR trap when the target 
anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule these
instructions before a branch, or hoist them out of a loop.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_do_global_ctors\*(C'\fR, a part of \fIlibgcc\fR
that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by \-1.  With the
\&\fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR option, the \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR is done before testing against \-1.
That means that all the constructors run a bit more quickly, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR
loads \-1 into a target register.
.Sp
Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR.  Unless specified explicitly with 
\&\fB\-mgettrcost\fR, \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR also implies \fB\-mgettrcost=100\fR;
this deters register allocation from using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.

\&\f(CW\*(C`movi\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`shori\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR,
but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that cause \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR to trap.
This option is only meaningful when \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR is in effect.

.IX Item "-mimpure-text"
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, used in addition to \fB\-shared\fR, tells
the compiler to not pass \fB\-z text\fR to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mimpure\-text\fR suppresses the \*(L"relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections\*(R" linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using \fB\-mimpure\-text\fR, you should compile all source code with
\&\fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mapp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapp-regs"
.PD
Specify \fB\-mapp\-regs\fR to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the \s-1SPARC SVR4 ABI\s0 reserves for applications.  Like the
global register 1, each global register 2 through 4 is then treated as an
allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  This is the default.
.Sp
To be fully \s-1SVR4\s0 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify \fB\-mno\-app\-regs\fR.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.
.IP "\fB\-mflat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mflat"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-flat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-flat"
.PD
With \fB\-mflat\fR, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a \*(L"flat\*(R" or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0\-\-5) are still treated as \*(L"call-saved\*(R" registers and are
saved on the stack as needed.
.Sp
With \fB\-mno\-flat\fR (the default), the compiler generates save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal operating mode.

your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for

\&\fBsparclite\-*\-*\fR do provide software floating-point support.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC,\s0 with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-mhard\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhard-quad-float"
Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
instructions.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-quad-float"
Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the \s-1SPARC ABI. \s0 This is the default.
.Sp
As of this writing, there are no \s-1SPARC\s0 implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the \s-1ABI\s0 library routines.  Thus the
\&\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR option is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-unaligned\-doubles\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munaligned-doubles"
.PD
Assume that doubles have 8\-byte alignment.  This is the default.
.Sp
With \fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 assumes that doubles have 8\-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4\-byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating-point code.

default is \fB\-mno\-user\-mode\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-faster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-faster-structs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfaster-structs"
.PD
With \fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8\-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
\&\f(CW\*(C`ldd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`st\*(C'\fR pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the \s-1SPARC
ABI. \s0 Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with
the rules of the \s-1ABI.\s0

256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.  By default, \s-1GCC\s0 makes
sure it is within 125.
.IP "\fB\-msafe\-hints\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msafe-hints"
Work around a hardware bug that causes the \s-1SPU\s0 to stall indefinitely.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 inserts the \f(CW\*(C`hbrp\*(C'\fR instruction to make sure
this stall won't happen.

.PP
These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
compatibility with other compilers on those systems:
.IP "\fB\-G\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G"
Create a shared object.
It is recommended that \fB\-symbolic\fR or \fB\-shared\fR be used instead.
.IP "\fB\-Qy\fR" 4

.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are supported on the TILE-Gx:
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=small\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmodel=small"
Generate code for the small model.  The distance for direct calls is
limited to 500M in either direction.  PC-relative addresses are 32
bits.  Absolute addresses support the full address range.
.IP "\fB\-mcmodel=large\fR" 4

Enable or disable use of \f(CW\*(C`CONST16\*(C'\fR instructions for loading

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fused\-madd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fused-madd"
.PD
Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict \s-1IEEE\s0 754\-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with \fImore\fR bits of
precision than specified by the \s-1IEEE\s0 standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.

When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 inserts \f(CW\*(C`MEMW\*(C'\fR instructions before

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-text-section-literals"
.PD
Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
\&\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data \s-1RAM/ROM,\s0 and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With \fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly

.IX Item "-mtarget-align"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-target\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-target-align"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
default is \fB\-mtarget\-align\fR.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like \f(CW\*(C`LOOP\*(C'\fR, which the
assembler always aligns, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting \s-1NOP\s0 instructions.
.IP "\fB\-mlongcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlongcalls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-longcalls"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct \f(CW\*(C`CALL\*(C'\fR
instruction into an \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR followed by a \f(CW\*(C`CALLX\*(C'\fR instruction.
The default is \fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by \s-1GCC\s0 still shows direct call
instructions\-\-\-look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

For front ends that support it, generate additional code to check that

this option defaults to true and false respectively.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-reuse=\fR\fIreuse-level\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-reuse=reuse-level"
This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  \fIreuse_level\fR can be \fBall\fR,
\&\fBnamed_vars\fR, or \fBnone\fR. \fBall\fR enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, \fBnamed_vars\fR enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and \fBnone\fR disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is \fBall\fR. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime will likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the \*(C+
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.

.IX Item "-ftrapv"
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwrapv"
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations

front end, as required by the Java language specification.
.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexceptions"
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 enables it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnon-call-exceptions"
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows \fItrapping\fR
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as \f(CW\*(C`SIGALRM\*(C'\fR.

Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise

.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-unique\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-unique"
On systems with recent \s-1GNU\s0 assembler and C library, the \*(C+ compiler
uses the \f(CW\*(C`STB_GNU_UNIQUE\*(C'\fR binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of \f(CW\*(C`RTLD_LOCAL\*(C'\fR; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
\&\f(CW\*(C`RTLD_LOCAL\*(C'\fR plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes \f(CW\*(C`dlclose\*(C'\fR to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a \s-1DSO\s0 via
\&\f(CW\*(C`dlclose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR, you can use
\&\fB\-fno\-gnu\-unique\fR.

GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

If you specify neither \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR nor

.IP "\fB\-fno\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-common"
In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by \fB\-fcommon\fR, and is the default
for \s-1GCC\s0 on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by \s-1ISO C,\s0 and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The \fB\-fno\-common\fR option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR) in two different compilations,
you get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with \fB\-fcommon\fR instead.
Compiling with \fB\-fno\-common\fR is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.

Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while

extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
.IP "\fB\-frecord\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frecord-gcc-switches"
This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing \s-1ASCII\s0 text.  This
switch is related to the \fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also \fB\-grecord\-gcc\-switches\fR for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
.IP "\fB\-fpic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpic"
Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000. \s0 The 386 has no such limit.)
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the \s-1IBM RS/6000\s0 is always
position-independent.

Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_return_address\*(C'\fR does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

\&                                       void *call_site);
.Ve
.Sp
The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \fBextern inline\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\*(C'\fR).  If the file that

that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the \fIfile\fR parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.

.IX Item "-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,..."
This is similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list\*(C'\fR,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as \f(CW\*(C`vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)\*(C'\fR, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE\*(C'\fR).  The
match is done on substrings: if the \fIsym\fR parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and \*(C+
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 not
using universal character names.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-check"
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the

a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.
.Sp
You can additionally specify a string parameter: \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR means no
checking, \f(CW\*(C`generic\*(C'\fR means force the use of old-style checking,
\&\f(CW\*(C`specific\*(C'\fR means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare \fB\-fstack\-check\fR.
.Sp
Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:

.IP "1." 4
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.
.IP "2." 4
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is

a warning is issued by the compiler.

generic implementation, code performance is hampered.

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,

the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

.IX Item "-fsplit-stack"
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only

When code compiled with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR calls code compiled
without \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR is not an option,

.Sp
For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility\fR of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(hidden)\fR and
\&\fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility pop\fR.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed \fBas
part of the \s-1API\s0 interface contract\fR and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local \s-1DSO\s0 should \fBalways\fR be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid \s-1PLT\s0 indirection overheads\-\-\-making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 specification requirements, \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator delete\*(C'\fR must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(default)\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp
\&\fBextern\fR declarations are not affected by \fB\-fvisibility\fR, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
functions with no explicit visibility use the \s-1PLT,\s0 so it is more
effective to use \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute ((visibility))\*(C'\fR and/or
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility\*(C'\fR to tell the compiler which \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
declarations should be treated as hidden.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fvisibility\fR does affect \*(C+ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the \fBtype_info\fR nodes are unified between
the DSOs.
.Sp
An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\fR>.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-volatile\-bitfields\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-volatile-bitfields"
This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force \s-1GCC\s0 to use 16\-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32\-bit access.
.Sp
If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32\-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.
.Sp
In some cases, such as when the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute is applied to a 
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case \s-1GCC\s0 falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that 
will fault or truncate the result at run time.
.Sp
Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/\*(C+11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field members.
.Sp
The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.
.IP "\fB\-fsync\-libcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsync-libcalls"
This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync\*(C'\fR
family of functions may be used to implement the \*(C+11 \f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic\*(C'\fR
family of functions.
.Sp
The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is \fB\-fno\-sync\-libcalls\fR.  This option is used in
the implementation of the \fIlibatomic\fR runtime library.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information which allows \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG"
Setting \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR is nearly equivalent to passing
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 searches
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR just before it searches the standard directory 
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
\&\fIprefix\fR then the value of \fIprefix\fR is replaced by
\&\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR when looking for header files.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`mblen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mbtowc\*(C'\fR as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPATH"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBC_INCLUDE_PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "C_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

On some systems, \fBgcc \-shared\fR

Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC,\s0 it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The \*(L"overall options\*(R" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command-line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dv\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-v\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the \fB\-l\fR option is significant.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example,
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

.SS "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

You can specify the input language explicitly with the \fB\-x\fR option:
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x language"
Specify explicitly the \fIlanguage\fR for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next \fB\-x\fR option.  Possible values for \fIlanguage\fR are:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        c  c\-header  cpp\-output
\&        c++  c++\-header  c++\-cpp\-output
\&        objective\-c  objective\-c\-header  objective\-c\-cpp\-output

\&        go
\&        java
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-x none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x none"
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if \fB\-x\fR
has not been used at all).
.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, \*(C+, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
.Sp
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, etc., with \fB.s\fR.
.Sp
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
.Sp
Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Place output in file \fIfile\fR.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
.Sp
If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI.gch\fR, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4
.IX Item "-###"
Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and arguments

.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-\-help={\fR\fIclass\fR|[\fB^\fR]\fIqualifier\fR\fB}\fR[\fB,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...]"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimizers\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimizers"
Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
.IP "\fBwarnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "warnings"

produced by the compiler.
.IP "\fBtarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "target"
Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
\&\fB\-\-target\-help\fR option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended \fB\-\-help=\fR syntax.
.IP "\fBparams\fR" 4
.IX Item "params"
Display the values recognized by the \fB\-\-param\fR
option.
.IP "\fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "language"

\&\fIlanguage\fR is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fBcommon\fR" 4
.IX Item "common"
Display the options that are common to all languages.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
These are the supported qualifiers:
.IP "\fBundocumented\fR" 4
.IX Item "undocumented"
Display only those options that are undocumented.
.IP "\fBjoined\fR" 4
.IX Item "joined"
Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
\&\fB\-\-help=target\fR.
.IP "\fBseparate\fR" 4
.IX Item "separate"
Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: \fB\-o output-file\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
\&\fB^\fR character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The argument to \fB\-\-help=\fR should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.
.Sp
Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
\&\fItarget\fR.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-\-help=\fR option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.
.Sp
If the \fB\-Q\fR option appears on the command line before the
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR option, then the descriptive text displayed by
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the \fB\-\-help=\fR option is used).
.Sp
Here is a truncated example from the \s-1ARM\s0 port of \fBgcc\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&          % gcc \-Q \-mabi=2 \-\-help=target \-c
\&          The following options are target specific:
\&          \-mabi=                                2
\&          \-mabort\-on\-noreturn                   [disabled]
\&          \-mapcs                                [disabled]
.Ve
.Sp
The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at \fB\-O2\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by \fB\-O3\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O3 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O3\-opts
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O2\-opts
\&        diff /tmp/O2\-opts /tmp/O3\-opts | grep enabled

.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire

backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.SS "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR, \fB.hpp\fR,
\&\fB.H\fR, or (for shared template code) \fB.tcc\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, the use of \fBgcc\fR does not add the \*(C+ library.
\&\fBg++\fR is a program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 and automatically specifies linking
against the \*(C+ library.  It treats \fB.c\fR,
\&\fB.h\fR and \fB.i\fR files as \*(C+ source files instead of C source
files unless \fB\-x\fR is used.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a \fB.h\fR extension for use in \*(C+
compilations.  On many systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with
the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.
.SS "Options Controlling C Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling C Dialect"
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+) that the compiler
accepts:
.IP "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, this is equivalent to \fB\-std=c90\fR. In \*(C+ mode, it is
equivalent to \fB\-std=c++98\fR.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO
C90 \s0(when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO C\s0 program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-Wpedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO C \s0(such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in
functions when \fB\-ansi\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-std=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-std="
Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or \*(C+.
.Sp
The compiler can accept several base standards, such as \fBc90\fR or
\&\fBc++98\fR, and \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of those standards, such as
\&\fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu++98\fR.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
\&\fB\-std=c90\fR turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are
incompatible with \s-1ISO C90,\s0 such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR
keywords, but not other \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not have a meaning in
\&\s-1ISO C90,\s0 such as omitting the middle term of a \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR
expression. On the other hand, when a \s-1GNU\s0 dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to identify which features are \s-1GNU\s0
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
\&\fB\-std=gnu90 \-Wpedantic\fR warns about \*(C+ style \fB//\fR
comments, while \fB\-std=gnu99 \-Wpedantic\fR does not.

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is

is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  The most obvious example is an \s-1OS\s0 kernel.
This is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-hosted\fR.

.IX Item "-fopenmp"
Enable handling of OpenMP directives \f(CW\*(C`#pragma omp\*(C'\fR in C/\*(C+ and

compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v4.0 <\fBhttp://www.openmp.org/\fR>.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets that

.IX Item "-fcilkplus"
Enable the usage of Cilk Plus language extension features for C/\*(C+.
When the option \fB\-fcilkplus\fR is specified, enable the usage of
the Cilk Plus Language extension features for C/\*(C+.  The present
implementation follows \s-1ABI\s0 version 1.2.  This is an experimental
feature that is only partially complete, and whose interface may
change in future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 as the official specification

.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-tm"
When the option \fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR is specified, the compiler
generates code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional
Memory \s-1ABI\s0 specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is
an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions

Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of

.IP "\fB\-funsigned\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

.IX Item "-fsigned-char"
Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be signed, like \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR.

Note that this is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-unsigned\-char\fR, which is
the negative form of \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.  Likewise, the option
\&\fB\-fno\-signed\-char\fR is equivalent to \fB\-funsigned\-char\fR.

These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either \f(CW\*(C`signed\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`unsigned\*(C'\fR.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR are signed types.
.SS "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`firstClass.C\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        g++ \-g \-frepo \-O \-c firstClass.C
.Ve
.PP
In this example, only \fB\-frepo\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC.\s0
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI. \s0 The default is version 2.
.Sp
Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.  Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs are fixed.
.Sp
Version 1 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.
.Sp
Version 2 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.4.
.Sp
Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
.Sp
Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
.Sp
Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
.Sp
Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of \*(C+11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and \-\-, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
.Sp
See also \fB\-Wabi\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-access\-control\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-access-control"
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-new"
Check that the pointer returned by \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the \*(C+ standard specifies that
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR only returns \f(CW0\fR if it is declared
\&\fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing \f(CW\*(C`std::bad_alloc\*(C'\fR.  See also
\&\fBnew (nothrow)\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fconstexpr\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstexpr-depth=n"
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for \*(C+11 constexpr functions
to \fIn\fR.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
.IP "\fB\-fdeduce\-init\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdeduce-init-list"
Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
\&\f(CW\*(C`std::initializer_list\*(C'\fR from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        template <class T> auto forward(T t) \-> decltype (realfn (t))
\&        {
\&          return realfn (t);

\&        
\&        void f()
\&        {
\&          forward({1,2}); // call forward<std::initializer_list<int>>
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the \*(C+11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
.IP "\fB\-ffriend\-injection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffriend-injection"
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
\&\*(C+ Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.
.Sp
This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
\&\fB\s-1NDEBUG\s0\fR.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.
.IP "\fB\-fextern\-tls\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fextern-tls-init"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-extern-tls-init"
.PD
The \*(C+11 and OpenMP standards allow \fBthread_local\fR and
\&\fBthreadprivate\fR variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining \s-1TU\s0 needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining \s-1TU\s0 will be executed before any uses in
another \s-1TU\s0), they can avoid this overhead with the
\&\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR option.
.Sp
On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
\&\fB\-fextern\-tls\-init\fR.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is \fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffor\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffor-scope"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-for-scope"
.PD
If \fB\-ffor\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR is limited to the \fBfor\fR loop itself,
as specified by the \*(C+ standard.
If \fB\-fno\-for\-scope\fR is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a \fIfor-init-statement\fR extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of \*(C+.
.Sp
If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-keywords"
Do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR instead.
\&\fB\-ansi\fR implies \fB\-fno\-gnu\-keywords\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-templates"
Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-implicit\-inline\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implicit-inline-templates"
Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and

.IP "\fB\-fno\-implement\-inlines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-implement-inlines"
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by \fB#pragma implementation\fR.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
.IP "\fB\-fms\-extensions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fms-extensions"
Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in \s-1MFC,\s0 such as implicit

Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
\&\s-1ANSI/ISO C. \s0 These include \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_exit\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bzero\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`conjf\*(C'\fR, and other related functions.
.IP "\fB\-fnothrow\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnothrow-opt"
Treat a \f(CW\*(C`throw()\*(C'\fR exception specification as if it were a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noexcept\*(C'\fR specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the \s-1EH\s0 cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to \f(CW\*(C`terminate\*(C'\fR rather than \f(CW\*(C`unexpected\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-operator\-names\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-operator-names"
Do not treat the operator name keywords \f(CW\*(C`and\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bitand\*(C'\fR,

synonyms as keywords.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-optional\-diags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-optional-diags"
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
.IP "\fB\-fpermissive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpermissive"
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using \fB\-fpermissive\fR allows some
nonconforming code to compile.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-pretty-templates"
When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`void f(T) [with T = int]\*(C'\fR
rather than \f(CW\*(C`void f(int)\*(C'\fR) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use \fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR to disable them.
.IP "\fB\-frepo\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frepo"
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies \fB\-fno\-implicit\-templates\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-rtti\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-rtti"
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ run-time type identification features
(\fBdynamic_cast\fR and \fBtypeid\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The \fBdynamic_cast\fR operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or to
unambiguous base classes.
.IP "\fB\-fstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-enums\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-enums"
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the \*(C+ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-backtrace\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=n"
Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
warning or error to \fIn\fR.  The default value is 10.
.IP "\fB\-ftemplate\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth=n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO \*(C+\s0
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in \*(C+11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-threadsafe\-statics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-threadsafe-statics"
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+
\&\s-1ABI\s0 for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-cxa\-atexit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-get\-exception\-ptr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This
causes \f(CW\*(C`std::uncaught_exception\*(C'\fR to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO. \s0 Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
.Sp
You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.
.Sp
Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-ms\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-ms-compat"
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make \s-1GCC\s0's \*(C+
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
.Sp
The flag makes these changes to \s-1GCC\s0's linkage model:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
It sets the default visibility to \f(CW\*(C`hidden\*(C'\fR, like
\&\fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR.
.IP "2." 4
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
.IP "3." 4
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
In new code it is better to use \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
.Sp
Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the \s-1ODR\s0 to define types with the same name differently.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-fvtable\-verify=\fR\fIstd|preinit|none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvtable-verify=std|preinit|none"
Turn on (or off, if using \fB\-fvtable\-verify=none\fR) the security
feature that verifies at runtime, for every virtual call that is made, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected (at runtime), an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.
.Sp
This option causes runtime data structures to be built, at program start up,
for verifying the vtable pointers.  The options \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`preinit\*(C'\fR
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches 'main'.  The
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR causes these data structure to be built after the
shared libraries have been loaded and initialized.
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR causes them to be built before the shared
libraries have been loaded and initialized.
.Sp
If this option appears multiple times in the compiler line, with different
values specified, 'none' will take highest priority over both 'std' and
\&'preinit'; 'preinit' will take priority over 'std'.
.IP "\fB\-fvtv\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvtv-debug"
Causes debug versions of the runtime functions for the vtable verification 
feature to be called.  This assumes the \fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR or
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR has been used.  This flag will also cause the
compiler to keep track of which vtable pointers it found for each class, and
record that information in the file \*(L"vtv_set_ptr_data.log\*(R", in the dump
file directory on the user's machine.

This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR or \fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR, this
causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls
it encountered and the number of verifications it inserted.  It also
counts the number of calls to certain runtime library functions
that it inserts.  This information, for each compilation unit, is written
to a file named \*(L"vtv_count_data.log\*(R", in the dump_file directory on
the user's machine.   It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets
for each class, and writes this information to \*(L"vtv_class_set_sizes.log\*(R"
in the same directory.
.Sp
Note:  This feature \s-1APPENDS\s0 data to the log files.  To get a fresh log
files, be sure to delete any existing ones.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-weak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-weak"
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
.IP "\fB\-nostdinc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc++"
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
\&\*(C+, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the \*(C+ library.)
.PP
In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-Wabi\fR (C, Objective-C, \*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wabi (C, Objective-C, and Objective- only)"
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral \*(C+ \s-1ABI. \s0 Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.
.Sp
You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
.Sp
The known incompatibilities in \fB\-fabi\-version=2\fR (the default) include:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type is
mangled incorrectly:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern int N;
\&        template <int &> struct S {};
\&        void n (S<N>) {2}
.Ve
.Sp
This is fixed in \fB\-fabi\-version=3\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1SIMD\s0 vector types declared using \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute ((vector_size))\*(C'\fR are
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of

.Sp
The mangling is changed in \fB\-fabi\-version=4\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The known incompatibilities in \fB\-fabi\-version=1\fR include:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
\&        struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ places \f(CW\*(C`B::f2\*(C'\fR into the same byte
as \f(CW\*(C`A::f1\*(C'\fR; other compilers do not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that causes G++ and other compilers to
lay out \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
\&        struct B { B(); char c2; };
\&        struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, G++ does not place \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR into the tail-padding for
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR; other compilers do.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that causes G++ and other
compilers to lay out \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR identically.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        union U { int i : 4096; };
.Ve
.Sp
Assuming that an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR does not have 4096 bits, G++ makes the
union too small by the number of bits in an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        struct A {};
\&        
\&        struct B {
\&          A a;
\&          virtual void f ();
\&        };
\&        
\&        struct C : public B, public A {};
.Ve
.Sp
G++ places the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR base class of \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
\&\f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR data member of \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR is already at offset zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Names of template functions whose types involve \f(CW\*(C`typename\*(C'\fR or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.
.Sp
.Vb 2

\&        
\&        template <template <typename> class Q>

Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

For SysV/x86\-64, unions with \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR members are

.IP "\fB\-Wctor\-dtor\-privacy\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wctor-dtor-privacy ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no non-private
methods, and there's at least one private member function that isn't
a constructor or destructor.
.IP "\fB\-Wdelete\-non\-virtual\-dtor\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when \fBdelete\fR is used to destroy an instance of a class that
has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled
by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wliteral\-suffix\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wliteral-suffix ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does
not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming extension, \s-1GCC\s0 treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from \f(CW\*(C`<inttypes.h>\*(C'\fR.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        #define _\|_STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
\&        #include <inttypes.h>
\&        #include <stdio.h>

In this case, \f(CW\*(C`PRId64\*(C'\fR is treated as a separate preprocessing token.

Warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by \*(C+11 occurs within
\&\fB{ }\fR, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int
.Ve
.Sp
This flag is included in \fB\-Wall\fR and \fB\-Wc++11\-compat\fR.
.Sp
With \fB\-std=c++11\fR, \fB\-Wno\-narrowing\fR suppresses the diagnostic
required by the standard.  Note that this does not affect the meaning
of well-formed code; narrowing conversions are still considered
ill-formed in \s-1SFINAE\s0 context.
.IP "\fB\-Wnoexcept\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnoexcept ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. \fB\f(BIthrow()\fB\fR or \fBnoexcept\fR) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.
.IP "\fB\-Wnon\-virtual\-dtor\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnon-virtual-dtor ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual
destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which
case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This
warning is automatically enabled if \fB\-Weffc++\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-Wreorder\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wreorder ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 5

a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fext\-numeric\-literals\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-fext-numeric-literals ( and Objective- only)"
Accept imaginary, fixed-point, or machine-defined

.RE
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-null\-sentinel\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-null-sentinel ( and Objective- only)"
Warn about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined
to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_null\*(C'\fR.  Although it is a null pointer constant rather than a
null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.
But this use is not portable across different compilers.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( and Objective- only)"
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
\&\fBfriend foo(int)\fR), the \*(C+ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, \fB\-Wnon\-template\-friend\fR allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default.
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
\&\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR, which keeps the conformant compiler code
but disables the helpful warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-cast\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-cast ( and Objective- only)"
Warn if an old-style (C\-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a \*(C+ program.  The new-style casts (\fBdynamic_cast\fR,
\&\fBstatic_cast\fR, \fBreinterpret_cast\fR, and \fBconst_cast\fR) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.
.IP "\fB\-Woverloaded\-virtual\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Woverloaded-virtual ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:
.Sp
.Vb 3

the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR class version of \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR is hidden in \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR, and code
like:

.Vb 2
\&        B* b;

to a plain pointer.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-promo\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-promo ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
.SS "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialects"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective- Dialects"
(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
languages themselves.
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \f(CW\*(C`some_class.m\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-g \-fgnu\-runtime \-O \-c some_class.m
.Ve
.PP
In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC.\s0
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, overrides the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS X. \s0 The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (\f(CW\*(C`[receiver
message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and \s-1ABI\s0 version 0 or 1.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-abi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-abi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the Objective-C \s-1ABI\s0 for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64\-bit) \s-1ABI. \s0 If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32\-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64\-bit target machines.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.4\s0 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-direct\-dispatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-direct-dispatch"
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-exceptions"
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by \*(C+ and Java.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords \f(CW@try\fR,
\&\f(CW@throw\fR, \f(CW@catch\fR, \f(CW@finally\fR and
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  This option is available with both the \s-1GNU\s0
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.2\s0 and earlier).
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-gc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-gc"
Enable garbage collection (\s-1GC\s0) in Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-nilcheck\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-nilcheck"
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the \s-1ABI,\s0 check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
\&\fB\-fno\-objc\-nilcheck\fR.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime \s-1ABI,\s0 is used.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-std=objc1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-std=objc1"
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by \s-1GCC 4.0. \s0 This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/\*(C+ language; it does not affect conformance to C/\*(C+ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/\*(C+ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by \s-1GCC 4.0\s0 is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\-freplace\-objc\-classes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freplace-objc-classes"
Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow \fB\f(BIdyld\fB\|(1)\fR to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.3\s0
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The \s-1GNU\s0 runtime currently always retains calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_get_class("...")\*(C'\fR
regardless of command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-gen\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gen-decls"
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named \fI\fIsourcename\fI.decl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wassign\-intercept\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then

.IX Item "-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are

in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final

.SS "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
.IX Subsection "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.
.IP "\fB\-fmessage\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmessage-length=n"
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about \fIn\fR
characters.  The default is 72 characters for \fBg++\fR and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by \s-1GCC. \s0 If \fIn\fR is zero, then no
line-wrapping is done; each error message appears on a single
line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=once"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information \fIonce\fR; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=every\-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-color"
.PD
Use color in diagnostics.  \fI\s-1WHEN\s0\fR is \fBnever\fR, \fBalways\fR,
or \fBauto\fR.  The default is \fBnever\fR if \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR environment
variable isn't present in the environment, and \fBauto\fR otherwise.
\&\fBauto\fR means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal.
The forms \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color\fR and \fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-color\fR are
aliases for \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color=always\fR and
\&\fB\-fdiagnostics\-color=never\fR, respectively.
.Sp
The colors are defined by the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (\s-1SGR\s0) substrings. \s-1SGR\s0 commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
Common values to concatenate include
\&\fB1\fR for bold,
\&\fB4\fR for underline,
\&\fB5\fR for blink,
\&\fB7\fR for inverse,
\&\fB39\fR for default foreground color,
\&\fB30\fR to \fB37\fR for foreground colors,
\&\fB90\fR to \fB97\fR for 16\-color mode foreground colors,
\&\fB38;5;0\fR to \fB38;5;255\fR
for 88\-color and 256\-color modes foreground colors,
\&\fB49\fR for default background color,
\&\fB40\fR to \fB47\fR for background colors,
\&\fB100\fR to \fB107\fR for 16\-color mode background colors,
and \fB48;5;0\fR to \fB48;5;255\fR
for 88\-color and 256\-color modes background colors.
.Sp
The default \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR is
\&\fBerror=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:caret=01;32:locus=01:quote=01\fR
where \fB01;31\fR is bold red, \fB01;35\fR is bold magenta,
\&\fB01;36\fR is bold cyan, \fB01;32\fR is bold green and

.SS "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that

warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by \s-1GCC.\s0

.IX Item "-fmax-errors=n"
Limits the maximum number of error messages to \fIn\fR, at which point
\&\s-1GCC\s0 bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If \fIn\fR is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR is also
specified, then \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR takes precedence over this
option.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Inhibit all warning messages.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into errors.
.IP "\fB\-Werror=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror="
Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example \fB\-Werror=switch\fR turns the warnings
controlled by \fB\-Wswitch\fR into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate \fB\-Werror\fR for specific
warnings; for example \fB\-Wno\-error=switch\fR makes
\&\fB\-Wswitch\fR warnings not be errors, even when \fB\-Werror\fR
is in effect.
.Sp
The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
\&\fB\-Werror=\fR and \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
\&\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR flag.)
.Sp
Note that specifying \fB\-Werror=\fR\fIfoo\fR automatically implies
\&\fB\-W\fR\fIfoo\fR.  However, \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR\fIfoo\fR does not
imply anything.
.IP "\fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfatal-errors"
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
\&\fB\-W\fR, for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings; for
example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to \fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and
\&\fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.
.PP
When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-warning\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the \fB\-Wno\-\fR form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for \fB\-Wno\-unknown\-warning\fR unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new \fB\-Wno\-\fR options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

Issue all the warnings demanded by strict \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0;

version of the \s-1ISO C\s0 standard specified by any \fB\-std\fR option used.
.Sp
Valid \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO C\s0).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO
C\s0 conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO C \s0\fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO C\s0 might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO C\s0 on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU
C\s0 dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the \fB\-Wuninitialized\fR option.
.Sp
For example, \s-1GCC\s0 warns about \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when \fB\-Winit\-self\fR has been specified:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        int f()

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-function\-declaration\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)"
Give a warning whenever a function is used before being declared. In
C99 mode (\fB\-std=c99\fR or \fB\-std=gnu99\fR), this warning is

.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wimplicit (C and Objective-C only)"

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wignored\-qualifiers\fR (C and \*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wignored-qualifiers (C and only)"
Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR.  For \s-1ISO C\s0 such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For \*(C+, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 prohibits qualified \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.
.Sp
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmain\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmain"
Warn if the type of \fBmain\fR is suspicious.  \fBmain\fR should be
a function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.  This warning
is enabled by default in \*(C+ and is enabled by either \fB\-Wall\fR
or \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-braces\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-braces"
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for \fBa\fR is not fully
bracketed, but that for \fBb\fR is fully bracketed.  This warning is
enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR in C.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
\&        int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-include\-dirs\fR (C, \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, , Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.
.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
.Sp
Also warn if a comparison like \fBx<=y<=z\fR appears; this is
equivalent to \fB(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\fR, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.Sp
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C/\*(C+, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR
can belong to the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code
looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Also warn for dangerous uses of the \s-1GNU\s0 extension to
\&\f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and \*(C+ standards.
.Sp
The C and \*(C+ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/\*(C+
program are evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and \*(C+ standards specify that \*(L"Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.\*(R".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a[n]
= b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR for C and \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-return\-local\-addr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-return-local-addr"
Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in \*(C+, a reference) to a
variable that goes out of scope after the function returns.
.IP "\fB\-Wreturn\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wreturn-type"
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults
to \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  Also warn about any \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with no
return value in a function whose return type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value), and about a \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with an
expression in a function whose return type is \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For \*(C+, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when \fB\-Wno\-return\-type\fR is specified.  The only
exceptions are \fBmain\fR and functions defined in system headers.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label prevents this
warning.)  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label).
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-default\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-default"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement does not have a \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR

.IP "\fB\-Wswitch\-enum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wswitch-enum"
Warn whenever a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  \f(CW\*(C`case\*(C'\fR labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between \fB\-Wswitch\fR and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR label.
.IP "\fB\-Wsync\-nand\fR (C and \*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsync-nand (C and only)"
Warn when \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync_fetch_and_nand\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync_nand_and_fetch\*(C'\fR
built-in functions are used.  These functions changed semantics in \s-1GCC 4.4.\s0
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-unused\-result\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-unused-result"
Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
\&\f(CW\*(C`warn_unused_result\*(C'\fR does not use
its return value. The default is \fB\-Wunused\-result\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-variable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-variable"
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static variable is unused

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.Sp
To suppress this warning use the \fBunused\fR attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-value\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-value"
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
\&\fBvoid\fR. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as \fBx[i,j]\fR causes a warning, while
\&\fBx[(void)i,j]\fR does not.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused"
All the above \fB\-Wunused\fR options combined.
.Sp
In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify \fB\-Wextra \-Wunused\fR (note that \fB\-Wall\fR implies
\&\fB\-Wunused\fR), or separately specify \fB\-Wunused\-parameter\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wuninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call. In \*(C+,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static \fBconst\fR member
appears in a class without constructors.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of \s-1GCC\s0 used.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.IP "\fB\-Wmaybe\-uninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmaybe-uninitialized"
For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time. These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {
\&            case 1: x = 1;
\&              break;
\&            case 2: x = 4;
\&              break;
\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with \fIassert\fR\|(0) or
similar code.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.
.Sp
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR or \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunknown-pragmas"
Warn when a \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR directive is encountered that is not understood by 
\&\s-1GCC. \s0 If this command-line option is used, warnings are even issued
for unknown pragmas in system header files.  This is not the case if
the warnings are only enabled by the \fB\-Wall\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pragmas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pragmas"
Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect parameters,
invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.  See also
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in \fB\-Wall\fR.
It is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing=n"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way \fB\-O\fR 
works.
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR.
.Sp
Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 3 (default for \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
\&\f(CW\*(C`*(int*)&some_float\*(C'\fR.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=n"
.PD
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
.Sp
An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=1"
Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example,  with \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR, the compiler simplifies
\&\f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > x\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR.  This level of
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=2"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`abs (x) >= 0\*(C'\fR.  This can only be
simplified when \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR is in effect, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`abs (INT_MIN)\*(C'\fR overflows to \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN\*(C'\fR, which is less than
zero.  \fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR (with no level) is the same as
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=3"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > 1\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x > 0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=4\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=4"
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: \f(CW\*(C`(x * 10) / 5\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x * 2\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=5\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=5"
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 2 > y\*(C'\fR is
simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 >= y\*(C'\fR.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

\&\s-1GCC\s0 guesses that function pointers with \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or

\&\s-1GCC\s0 also warns about function definitions that might be

that are always out of bounds. This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-div\-by\-zero\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-div-by-zero"
Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.  Floating-point
division by zero is not warned about, as it can be a legitimate way of
obtaining infinities and NaNs.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using \fB\-Wall\fR in conjunction with this
option does \fInot\fR warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers\-\-\-for that, \fB\-Wunknown\-pragmas\fR must also be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wtrampolines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrampolines"
.Vb 1
\& Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
\&
\& A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
\& time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and
\& is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it
\& is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But,
\& for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack
\& to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-equal\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-equal"
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
.Sp
The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO C. \s0 Also warn about \s-1ISO C\s0 constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in \s-1ISO C\s0 it does not.
.IP "\(bu" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\fB#pragma\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize \fB#elif\fR, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The unary plus operator.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the \fBL\fR suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however \s-1GCC\s0's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an operand of type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A non\-\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR function declaration follows a \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \s-1ISO\s0 type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Usage of \s-1ISO\s0 string concatenation is detected.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_\|_\*(C'\fR to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating\-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use \fB\-Wtraditional\-conversion\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use of \s-1ISO C\s0 style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
\&\fInot\fR issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these \s-1ISO C\s0 features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, \f(CW\*(C`PARAMS\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VPARAMS\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a \s-1GCC\s0 extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\-conversion\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
.IP "\fB\-Wdeclaration\-after\-statement\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from \*(C+, was introduced with \s-1ISO C99\s0 and is by default
allowed in \s-1GCC. \s0 It is not supported by \s-1ISO C90\s0 and was not supported by

.IX Item "-Wno-endif-labels"
Do not warn whenever an \fB#else\fR or an \fB#endif\fR are followed by text.
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow"
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable,
parameter, type, or class member (in \*(C+), or whenever a built-in function
is shadowed. Note that in \*(C+, the compiler warns if a local variable
shadows an explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum.
.IP "\fB\-Wlarger\-than=\fR\fIlen\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlarger-than=len"
Warn whenever an object of larger than \fIlen\fR bytes is defined.
.IP "\fB\-Wframe\-larger\-than=\fR\fIlen\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wframe-larger-than=len"
Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than \fIlen\fR bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate
and not conservative.
The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than \fIlen\fR
even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated
via \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, variable-length arrays, or related constructs
is not included by the compiler when determining

Warn if the stack usage of a function might be larger than \fIlen\fR bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack usage is conservative.
Any space allocated via \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, variable-length arrays, or related

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pedantic\-ms\-format\fR (MinGW targets only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW targets only)"
When used in combination with \fB\-Wformat\fR

disables the warnings about non-ISO \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`scanf\*(C'\fR format
width specifiers \f(CW\*(C`I32\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`I64\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`I\*(C'\fR used on Windows targets,
which depend on the \s-1MS\s0 runtime.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-arith\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-arith"
Warn about anything that depends on the \*(L"size of\*(R" a function type or
of \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.  \s-1GNU C\s0 assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR pointers and pointers
to functions.  In \*(C+, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
\&\f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wtype\-limits\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtype-limits"
Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to the limited
range of the data type, but do not warn for constant expressions.  For
example, warn if an unsigned variable is compared against zero with
\&\fB<\fR or \fB>=\fR.  This warning is also enabled by

to an ordinary \f(CW\*(C`char *\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an
unsafe way.  For example, casting \f(CW\*(C`char **\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`const char **\*(C'\fR

warnings help you find at compile time code that can try to write
into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
using \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is
just a nuisance. This is why we did not make \fB\-Wall\fR request

Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR statement or a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement jumps
forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a

.IX Item "-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess"
Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory built-in
functions if the argument uses \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR.  This warning warns e.g.
about \f(CW\*(C`memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`ptr\*(C'\fR is not an array,
but a pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about

\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waddress"
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`void func(void); if (func)\*(C'\fR, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as \f(CW\*(C`if (x == "abc")\*(C'\fR.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use \f(CW\*(C`strcmp\*(C'\fR.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wlogical\-op\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlogical-op"
Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
This includes using logical operators in contexts where a
bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.
.IP "\fB\-Waggregate\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waggregate-return"
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or

.IX Item "-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
This option is not valid for \*(C+ because all function declarations

.IX Item "-Wmissing-declarations"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous
non-prototype declarations; use \fB\-Wmissing\-prototype\fR to detect

.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-field\-initializers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-field-initializers"
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For

when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  \s-1GCC\s0 can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
.Sp
There are four levels of warning supported by \s-1GCC. \s0 The default is
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfc\fR, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the \s-1ISO 10646 \*(L"C\*(R"\s0 normalized form, \fI\s-1NFC\s0\fR.  \s-1NFC\s0 is the
recommended form for most uses.
.Sp
Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 that, when turned into \s-1NFC,\s0 are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 or \*(C+ and have all your identifiers in \s-1NFC.
\&\s0\fB\-Wnormalized=id\fR suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
.Sp
You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=none\fR.  You should only do this if you
are using some other normalization scheme (like \*(L"D\*(R"), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.
.Sp
Some characters in \s-1ISO 10646\s0 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance \f(CW\*(C`\eu207F\*(C'\fR, \*(L"\s-1SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N\*(R",\s0 displays just like a regular \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR that has been
placed in a superscript.  \s-1ISO 10646\s0 defines the \fI\s-1NFKC\s0\fR
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and \s-1GCC\s0 warns if your code is not in \s-1NFKC\s0 if you use
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfkc\fR.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-deprecated\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-deprecated"
Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-deprecated\-declarations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-deprecated-declarations"
Do not warn about uses of functions,
variables, and types marked as deprecated by using the \f(CW\*(C`deprecated\*(C'\fR
attribute.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-overflow"
Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant expressions.
.IP "\fB\-Wopenmp\-simd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wopenmp-simd"
Warn if the vectorizer cost model overrides the OpenMP or the Cilk Plus
simd directive set by user.  The \fB\-fsimd\-cost\-model=unlimited\fR can
be used to relax the cost model.
.IP "\fB\-Woverride\-init\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Woverride-init (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if an initialized field without side effects is overridden when
using designated initializers.
.Sp
This warning is included in \fB\-Wextra\fR.  To get other
\&\fB\-Wextra\fR warnings without this one, use \fB\-Wextra
\&\-Wno\-override\-init\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked"
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
is misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        struct foo {
\&          int x;
\&          char a, b, c, d;
\&        } _\|_attribute_\|_((packed));
\&        struct bar {
\&          char z;
\&          struct foo f;
\&        };
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wpacked\-bitfield\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpacked-bitfield-compat"
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of \s-1GCC\s0 ignore the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute
on bit-fields of type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR.  This has been fixed in \s-1GCC 4.4\s0 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  \s-1GCC\s0
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in \s-1GCC 4.4.\s0
For example there is no longer a 4\-bit padding between field \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR in this structure:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        struct foo
\&        {
\&          char a:4;
\&          char b:8;
\&        } _\|_attribute_\|_ ((packed));
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by default.  Use
\&\fB\-Wno\-packed\-bitfield\-compat\fR to disable this warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wnested\-externs\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnested-externs (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if an \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declaration is encountered within a function.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-inherited\-variadic\-ctor\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor"
Suppress warnings about use of \*(C+11 inheriting constructors when the
base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the warning is
on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( and Objective- only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \fBoffsetof\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 standard, applying \fBoffsetof\fR
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \fBoffsetof\fR typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types (such as a simple
\&\fBstruct\fR that fails to be a \s-1POD\s0 type only by virtue of having a
constructor).  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.
.Sp
The restrictions on \fBoffsetof\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-int\-to\-pointer\-cast\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast"
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a
different size. In \*(C+, casting to a pointer type of smaller size is
an error. \fBWint-to-pointer-cast\fR is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-to\-int\-cast\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and Objective-C only)"
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer type of a
different size.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-pch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-pch"
Warn if a precompiled header is found in
the search path but can't be used.
.IP "\fB\-Wlong\-long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlong-long"
Warn if \fBlong long\fR type is used.  This is enabled by either
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR or \fB\-Wtraditional\fR in \s-1ISO C90\s0 and \*(C+98
modes.  To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-long\-long\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvariadic\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvariadic-macros"
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic \s-1ISO C90\s0 mode, or the \s-1GNU\s0
alternate syntax when in pedantic \s-1ISO C99\s0 mode.  This is default.
To inhibit the warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-variadic\-macros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvarargs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvarargs"
Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable
arguments like \fBva_start\fR.  This is default.  To inhibit the
warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-varargs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvector\-operation\-performance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvector-operation-performance"
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via \s-1SIMD\s0 capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented \f(CW\*(C`piecewise\*(C'\fR, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
\&\f(CW\*(C`in parallel\*(C'\fR, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and \f(CW\*(C`as a single scalar\*(C'\fR, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-virtual\-move\-assign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-virtual-move-assign"
Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial \*(C+11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it will be
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.
.IP "\fB\-Wvla\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvla"
Warn if variable length array is used in the code.
\&\fB\-Wno\-vla\fR prevents the \fB\-Wpedantic\fR warning of
the variable length array.
.IP "\fB\-Wvolatile\-register\-var\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvolatile-register-var"
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-sign\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR and by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, which can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-sign\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstack-protector"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
.IP "\fB\-Woverlength\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Woverlength-strings"
Warn about string constants that are longer than the \*(L"minimum
maximum\*(R" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
.Sp
The limit applies \fIafter\fR string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing \s-1NUL. \s0 In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  \*(C+98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in \*(C+.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, and can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-overlength\-strings\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunsuffixed\-float\-constants\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)"
Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with \fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the \f(CW\*(C`FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64\*(C'\fR pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
.SS "Options for Debugging Your Program or \s-1GCC\s0"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or \s-1GCC:\s0
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF, XCOFF,\s0 or \s-1DWARF 2\s0).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR, \fB\-gstabs\fR,
\&\fB\-gxcoff+\fR, \fB\-gxcoff\fR, or \fB\-gvms\fR (see below).
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
.Sp
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.Sp
The following options are useful when \s-1GCC\s0 is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
.IP "\fB\-gsplit\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gsplit-dwarf"
Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension .dwo.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo
files.
.IP "\fB\-ggdb\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggdb"
Produce debugging information for use by \s-1GDB. \s0 This means to use the
most expressive format available (\s-1DWARF 2,\s0 stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including \s-1GDB\s0 extensions if at all
possible.
.IP "\fB\-gpubnames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gpubnames"
Generate dwarf .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections.
.IP "\fB\-ggnu\-pubnames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ggnu-pubnames"
Generate .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections in a format
suitable for conversion into a \s-1GDB\s0 index.  This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce \s-1GDB\s0 index version 7.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without \s-1GDB\s0 extensions.  This is the format used by \s-1DBX\s0 on most \s-1BSD\s0
systems.  On \s-1MIPS,\s0 Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by \s-1DBX\s0 or \s-1SDB.\s0
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler.
.IP "\fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
.IP "\fB\-femit\-class\-debug\-always\fR" 4
.IX Item "-femit-class-debug-always"
Instead of emitting debugging information for a \*(C+ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way \s-1GCC\s0
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
.IP "\fB\-fdebug\-types\-section\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdebug-types-section"
When using \s-1DWARF\s0 Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR section instead of making them part of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.debug_info\*(C'\fR section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all \s-1DWARF\s0 consumers support \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR sections yet
and on some objects \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.
.IP "\fB\-gstabs+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstabs+"
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
.IP "\fB\-gcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1COFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by \s-1SDB\s0 on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the \s-1DBX\s0 debugger on \s-1IBM RS/6000\s0 systems.
.IP "\fB\-gxcoff+\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gxcoff+"
Produce debugging information in \s-1XCOFF\s0 format (if that is supported),
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions understood only by the \s-1GNU\s0 debugger (\s-1GDB\s0).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the \s-1GNU\s0
assembler (\s-1GAS\s0) to fail with an error.
.IP "\fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gdwarf-version"
Produce debugging information in \s-1DWARF\s0 format (if that is supported).
The value of \fIversion\fR may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version
for most targets is 4.
.Sp
Note that with \s-1DWARF\s0 Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting \s-1DWARF 3\s0 extensions in the unwind tables.
.Sp
Version 4 may require \s-1GDB 7.0\s0 and \fB\-fvar\-tracking\-assignments\fR
for maximum benefit.
.IP "\fB\-grecord\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-grecord-gcc-switches"
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in \s-1DWARF\s0 debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  See also \fB\-frecord\-gcc\-switches\fR for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-gno\-record\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gno-record-gcc-switches"
Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer attribute
in \s-1DWARF\s0 debugging information.
.IP "\fB\-gstrict\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gstrict-dwarf"
Disallow using extensions of later \s-1DWARF\s0 standard version than selected
with \fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR.  On most targets using non-conflicting
\&\s-1DWARF\s0 extensions from later standard versions is allowed.
.IP "\fB\-gno\-strict\-dwarf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gno-strict-dwarf"
Allow using extensions of later \s-1DWARF\s0 standard version than selected with
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-\fR\fIversion\fR.
.IP "\fB\-gvms\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gvms"
Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is

.IX Item "-gvmslevel"
.PD
Request debugging information and also use \fIlevel\fR to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
.Sp
Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, \fB\-g0\fR negates
\&\fB\-g\fR.
.Sp
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
tables, but no information about local variables.
.Sp
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use \fB\-g3\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-gdwarf\-2\fR does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
\&\s-1GCC\s0 used to support an option \fB\-gdwarf\fR that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the \s-1DWARF\s0 format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional \fB\-g\fR\fIlevel\fR option to change the
debug level for \s-1DWARF.\s0
.IP "\fB\-gtoggle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gtoggle"
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=address\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=address"
Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
Memory access instructions will be instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.
See <\fBhttp://code.google.com/p/address\-sanitizer/\fR> for
more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
\&\fB\s-1ASAN_OPTIONS\s0\fR environment variable; see

Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector.
Memory access instructions will be instrumented to detect
data race bugs.  See <\fBhttp://code.google.com/p/thread\-sanitizer/\fR> for more
details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the \fB\s-1TSAN_OPTIONS\s0\fR

<\fBhttps://code.google.com/p/thread\-sanitizer/wiki/Flags\fR> for a list of
supported options.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=leak\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=leak"
Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.
This option only matters for linking of executables and if neither
\&\fB\-fsanitize=address\fR nor \fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR is used.  In that
case it will link the executable against a library that overrides \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR
and other allocator functions.  See
<\fBhttps://code.google.com/p/address\-sanitizer/wiki/LeakSanitizer\fR> for more
details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
\&\fB\s-1LSAN_OPTIONS\s0\fR environment variable.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=undefined\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=undefined"
Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior detector.
Various computations will be instrumented to detect undefined behavior
at runtime.  Current suboptions are:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=shift\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=shift"
This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is
not undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs
slightly between C and \*(C+, as well as between \s-1ISO C90\s0 and C99, etc.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=integer\-divide\-by\-zero\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero"
Detect integer division by zero as well as \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN / \-1\*(C'\fR division.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=unreachable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=unreachable"
With this option, the compiler will turn the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_unreachable\*(C'\fR
call into a diagnostics message call instead.  When reaching the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_unreachable\*(C'\fR call, the behavior is undefined.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=vla\-bound\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=vla-bound"
This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable
length array is positive.  This option does not have any effect in
\&\fB\-std=c++1y\fR mode, as the standard requires the exception be thrown
instead.
.IP "\fB\-fsanitize=null\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsanitize=null"
This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the application
built with this option turned on will issue an error message when it
tries to dereference a \s-1NULL\s0 pointer, or if a reference (possibly an
rvalue reference) is bound to a \s-1NULL\s0 pointer.

\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug=\fR, with the equal sign but without \fIopts\fR,

Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.
.Sp
This option is a detailed version of
\&\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-reduced\fR and \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-baseonly\fR,
which serves for most needs.
.Sp
A specification has the syntax[\fBdir:\fR|\fBind:\fR][\fBord:\fR|\fBgen:\fR](\fBany\fR|\fBsys\fR|\fBbase\fR|\fBnone\fR)
.Sp
The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (\fBdir:\fR) or used indirectly (\fBind:\fR).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
\&\fBstruct one direct; struct two * indirect;\fR.
.Sp
The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (\fBord:\fR) or generic structs (\fBgen:\fR).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For \*(C+, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR does not yet implement them.
.Sp
The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values \fBnone\fR and \fBany\fR have the normal meaning.
The value \fBbase\fR means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling \fIfoo.c\fR, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and \fIfoo.h\fR,
but not other header files.
The value \fBsys\fR means those types satisfying \fBbase\fR
or declared in system or compiler headers.
.Sp
You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.

Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a

\&\fI.su\fR to the \fIauxname\fR.  \fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
The name of the function.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A number of bytes.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier \f(CW\*(C`bounded\*(C'\fR is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by

a pass number and a word to the \fIdumpname\fR, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file. In case of
\&\fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files. Note that the pass number is
computed statically as passes get registered into the pass manager.
Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of execution of
passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin could have a
number over 200 even if it executed quite early.  \fIdumpname\fR is

Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
\&\fB\-\fR\fIoptions\fR form is used, \fIoptions\fR is a list of
\&\fB\-\fR separated options to select the dump details and
optimizations.  If \fIoptions\fR is not specified, it defaults to
\&\fBoptimized\fR for details and \fBoptall\fR for optimization
groups. If the \fIfilename\fR is not specified, it defaults to
\&\fIstderr\fR. Note that the output \fIfilename\fR will be overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, \fIstderr\fR should be used
instead.
.Sp
The options can be divided into two groups, 1) options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and 2) options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the latter options override the earlier options on the command
line. Though multiple \-fopt\-info options are accepted, only one of
them can have \fB=filename\fR. If other filenames are provided then
all but the first one are ignored.
.Sp
The dump verbosity has the following options
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimized\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimized"
Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which got
successfully vectorized.
.IP "\fBmissed\fR" 4
.IX Item "missed"
Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output. For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp

vectorization passes on stderr.

.IP "\fBoptall\fR" 4

.RS 4
.Sp
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-missed=missed.all
.Ve
.Sp
outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
\&\fImissed.all\fR.
.Sp
As another example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-inline\-optimized\-missed=inline.txt
.Ve
.Sp
will output information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
\&\fIinline.txt\fR.
.Sp
If the \fIfilename\fR is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the \fIfilename\fR.
Otherwise the dump is output onto \fIstderr\fR. If \fIoptions\fR is
omitted, it defaults to \fBall-optall\fR, which means dump all
available optimization info from all the passes. In the following
example, all optimization info is output on to \fIstderr\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info
.Ve
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed\fR behaves the same as
\&\fB\-fopt\-info\-missed\-vec\fR.
.Sp
As another example, consider
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed=vec.miss \-fopt\-info\-loop\-optimized=loop.opt
.Ve
.Sp
Here the two output filenames \fIvec.miss\fR and \fIloop.opt\fR are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only the \fIvec.miss\fR is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

For \fIn\fR greater than zero, \fB\-fsched\-verbose\fR outputs the
same information as \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched1\fR and \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-sched2\fR.
For \fIn\fR greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For \fIn\fR greater

.IX Item "-save-temps=cwd"
.PD
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR produces files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.Sp
When used in combination with the \fB\-x\fR command-line option,
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
If you invoke \s-1GCC\s0 in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        gcc \-save\-temps \-o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
\&        gcc \-save\-temps \-o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&
.Ve
.Sp
may result in \fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.o\fR being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.
.IP "\fB\-save\-temps=obj\fR" 4
.IX Item "-save-temps=obj"
Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently.  If the
\&\fB\-o\fR option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the \fB\-o\fR option is not used, the
\&\fB\-save\-temps=obj\fR switch behaves like \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3

\&        gcc \-save\-temps=obj \-c bar.c \-o dir/xbar.o
\&        gcc \-save\-temps=obj foobar.c \-o dir2/yfoobar
.Ve
.Sp
creates \fIfoo.i\fR, \fIfoo.s\fR, \fIdir/xbar.i\fR,

\&\fIdir2/yfoobar.o\fR.
.IP "\fB\-time\fR[\fB=\fR\fIfile\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-time[=file]"
Report the \s-1CPU\s0 time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).
.Sp
Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # cc1 0.12 0.01
\&        # as 0.00 0.01
.Ve
.Sp
The first number on each line is the \*(L"user time\*(R", that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is \*(L"system time\*(R",
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.Sp
With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        0.12 0.01 cc1 <options>
\&        0.00 0.01 as <options>
.Ve
.Sp
The \*(L"user time\*(R" and the \*(L"system time\*(R" are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one
can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.
.IP "\fB\-fvar\-tracking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvar-tracking"
Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each

.IX Item "-print-multi-lib"
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
\&\fB;\fR, and each switch starts with an \fB@\fR instead of the

.IX Item "-print-multi-os-directory"
Print the path to \s-1OS\s0 libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some \fIlib\fR subdirectory.  If \s-1OS\s0 libraries are
present in the \fIlib\fR subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just \fI.\fR, if \s-1OS\s0 libraries are present in \fIlib\fIsuffix\fI\fR
sibling directories this prints e.g. \fI../lib64\fR, \fI../lib\fR or
\&\fI../lib32\fR, or if \s-1OS\s0 libraries are present in \fIlib/\fIsubdir\fI\fR
subdirectories it prints e.g. \fIamd64\fR, \fIsparcv9\fR or \fIev6\fR.

This is useful when \fBgcc\fR prints the error message
\&\fBinstallation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory\fR.
To resolve this you either need to put \fIcpp0\fR and the other compiler
components where \fBgcc\fR expects to find them, or you can set the environment

Don't forget the trailing \fB/\fR.
.IP "\fB\-print\-sysroot\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-sysroot"
Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option, possibly with an extra

.IP "\fB\-fno\-eliminate\-unused\-debug\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types"
Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF 2\s0 output, \s-1GCC\s0 avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have \s-1GCC\s0 emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
.SS "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
.PP
Most optimizations are only enabled if an \fB\-O\fR level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.
.PP
Depending on the target and how \s-1GCC\s0 was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each \fB\-O\fR level than
those listed here.  You can invoke \s-1GCC\s0 with \fB\-Q \-\-help=optimizers\fR
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.

.IP "\fB\-fno\-defer\-pop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-defer-pop"
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function

.IP "\fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fomit-frame-pointer"
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that

restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  \fBIt also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.\fR
.Sp
On some machines, such as the \s-1VAX,\s0 this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer

arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or \*(C+ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched"
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\-allow\-regmoves\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves"
Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
\&\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-branch\-count\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-branch-count-reg"
Do not use \*(L"decrement and branch\*(R" instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result.
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, \s-1IA\-64\s0 and S/390.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fbranch\-count\-reg\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-function\-cse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-function-cse"
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
.Sp
This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ffunction\-cse\fR
.IP "\fB\-fno\-zero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss"
If the target supports a \s-1BSS\s0 section, \s-1GCC\s0 by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into \s-1BSS. \s0 This can save space in the resulting
code.
.Sp
This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section\-\-\-e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fzero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fthread\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fthread-jumps"
Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-wide\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-wide-types"
When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as \f(CW\*(C`long
long\*(C'\fR on a 32\-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR,
\&\fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-follow-jumps"
In common subexpression elimination (\s-1CSE\s0), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when \s-1CSE\s0 encounters an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with an
\&\f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR clause, \s-1CSE\s0 follows the jump when the condition
tested is false.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-skip-blocks"
This is similar to \fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR, but causes \s-1CSE\s0 to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When \s-1CSE\s0
encounters a simple \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with no else clause,
\&\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR causes \s-1CSE\s0 to follow the jump around the
body of the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR" 4

Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations are
performed.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse"
Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR When compiling a program using computed gotos, a \s-1GCC\s0
extension, you may get better run-time performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
\&\fB\-fno\-gcse\fR to the command line.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-lm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR is enabled, global common subexpression elimination
attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.
.Sp
Enabled by default when \fB\-fgcse\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-sm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-las\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-las"
When \fB\-fgcse\-las\fR is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-after-reload"
When \fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to clean up
redundant spilling.
.IP "\fB\-faggressive\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-faggressive-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling
and loop exit test optimizations.
This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to assume that loop indices do not
overflow, and that loops with nontrivial exit condition are not
infinite.  This enables a wider range of loop optimizations even if
the loop optimizer itself cannot prove that these assumptions are valid.
If you use \fB\-Wunsafe\-loop\-optimizations\fR, the compiler warns you
if it finds this kind of loop.
.IP "\fB\-fcrossjumping\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcrossjumping"
Perform cross-jumping transformation.
This transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fauto\-inc\-dec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fauto-inc-dec"
Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher on architectures that support this.
.IP "\fB\-fdce\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdce"
Perform dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) on \s-1RTL.\s0
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.

Perform dead store elimination (\s-1DSE\s0) on \s-1RTL.\s0
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fif\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fif-conversion"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by \f(CW\*(C`if\-conversion2\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fif\-conversion2\fR" 4

Use conditional execution (where available) to transform conditional jumps into
branch-less equivalents.

.IP "\fB\-fdeclone\-ctor\-dtor\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdeclone-ctor-dtor"
The \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 requires multiple entry points for constructors and
destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object, and
one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards.
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that call a common
implementation.
.Sp
Enabled by \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-null-pointer-checks"
Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in \s-1GCC\s0 use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.
.Sp
Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use \fB\-fno\-delete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.
.Sp
Some targets, especially embedded ones, disable this option at all levels.
Otherwise it is enabled at all levels: \fB\-O0\fR, \fB\-O1\fR,
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.  Passes that use the information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (\f(CW\*(C`\-findirect\-inlining\*(C'\fR) and interprocedural constant
propagation (\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR).
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\-speculatively\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize-speculatively"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct calls.
Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into an conditional deciding on direct and indirect call.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem
useless after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.
.IP "\fB\-fexpensive\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexpensive-optimizations"
Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-free\fR" 4

Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions.  This is especially
helpful for the x86\-64 architecture, which implicitly zero-extends in 64\-bit
registers after writing to their lower 32\-bit half.

Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live range
shrinkage.  This is helpful for fast processors with small or moderate
size register sets.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-algorithm=\fR\fIalgorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-algorithm=algorithm"
Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The \fIalgorithm\fR argument can be \fBpriority\fR, which
specifies Chow's priority coloring, or \fB\s-1CB\s0\fR, which specifies
Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented
for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is
the default because it generates better code.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-region=\fR\fIregion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-region=region"
Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
\&\fIregion\fR argument should be one of the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Use all loops as register allocation regions.
This can give the best results for machines with a small and/or
irregular register set.
.IP "\fBmixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "mixed"
Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure 
as the regions.  This value usually gives
the best results in most cases and for most architectures,
and is enabled by default when compiling with optimization for speed
(\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, ...).
.IP "\fBone\fR" 4
.IX Item "one"
Use all functions as a single region.

.Sp
This option is enabled at level \fB\-Os\fR for all targets.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-loop\-pressure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-loop-pressure"
Use \s-1IRA\s0 to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move
loop invariants.  This option usually results in generation
of faster and smaller code on machines with large register files (>= 32
registers), but it can slow the compiler down.
.Sp
This option is enabled at level \fB\-O3\fR for some targets.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ira\-share\-save\-slots\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-save-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard

separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are
larger.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ira\-share\-spill\-slots\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-spill-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-registers.  Each
pseudo-register that does not get a hard register gets a separate
stack slot, and as a result function stack frames are larger.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-verbose=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-verbose=n"
Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.
The default value is 5.  If the value \fIn\fR is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as \fIn\fR minus 10.

.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns"
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating-point instruction is required.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fschedule\-insns2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fschedule-insns2"
Similar to \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of

Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before register
allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling before register
allocation is enabled, i.e. with \fB\-fschedule\-insns\fR or at
\&\fB\-O2\fR or higher.  Usage of this option can improve the

increase above the number of available hard registers and subsequent
spills in register allocation.

.IX Item "-fsched2-use-superblocks"
When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock scheduling.

Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-reference\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-reference"
Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-pta\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-pta"
Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-profile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-profile"
Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`cold\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp"
Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-Os\fR and \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\-clone\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp-clone"
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see \fB\-\-param ipcp\-unit\-growth=\fR\fIvalue\fR).
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fisolate\-erroneous\-paths\-dereference\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference"
Detect paths which trigger erroneous or undefined behaviour due to
dereferencing a \s-1NULL\s0 pointer.  Isolate those paths from the main control
flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined behaviour into a trap.
.IP "\fB\-fisolate\-erroneous\-paths\-attribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute"
Detect paths which trigger erroneous or undefined behaviour due a \s-1NULL\s0 value
being used in a way which is forbidden by a \f(CW\*(C`returns_nonnull\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`nonnull\*(C'\fR
attribute.  Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the
statement with erroneous or undefined behaviour into a trap.  This is not
currently enabled, but may be enabled by \f(CW\*(C`\-O2\*(C'\fR in the future.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sink\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sink"
Perform forward store motion  on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-bit\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-bit-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate
pointer alignment information.
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It requires that \fB\-ftree\-ccp\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (\s-1CCP\s0) on trees.  This
pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-switch\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-switch-conversion"
Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-tail\-merge\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-tail-merge"
Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using \fBmax-tail-merge-comparisons\fR parameter and
\&\fBmax-tail-merge-iterations\fR parameter.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dce\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dce"
Perform dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) on trees.  This flag is enabled by
default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-builtin\-call\-dce\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-builtin-call-dce"
Perform conditional dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) for calls to built-in functions
that may set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR but are otherwise side-effect free.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher if \fB\-Os\fR is not also
specified.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dominator\-opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dominator-opts"
Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dse"
Perform dead store elimination (\s-1DSE\s0) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ch"
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It is not enabled
for \fB\-Os\fR, since it usually increases code size.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-optimize"
Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-linear\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-linear"
Perform loop interchange transformations on tree.  Same as
\&\fB\-floop\-interchange\fR.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has
to be configured with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-interchange\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-interchange"
Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a
loop like:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO J = 1, M
\&          DO I = 1, N
\&            A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
loop interchange transforms the loop as if it were written:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          DO J = 1, M
\&            A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
which can be beneficial when \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR is larger than the caches,
because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization
applies to all the languages supported by \s-1GCC\s0 and is not limited to
Fortran.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has to be configured
with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to enable the
Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-strip\-mine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-strip-mine"
Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR parameter.  For example,
given a loop like:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          A(I) = A(I) + C
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
loop strip mining transforms the loop as if it were written:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO II = 1, N, 51
\&          DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
\&            A(I) = A(I) + C
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
This optimization applies to all the languages supported by \s-1GCC\s0 and is
not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has to
be configured with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-block\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-block"
Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the
element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be changed
using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR parameter.  For example, given
a loop like:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          DO J = 1, M
\&            A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
loop blocking transforms the loop as if it were written:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        DO II = 1, N, 51
\&          DO JJ = 1, M, 51
\&            DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
\&              DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
\&                A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
\&              ENDDO
\&            ENDDO
\&          ENDDO
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
which can be beneficial when \f(CW\*(C`M\*(C'\fR is larger than the caches,
because the innermost loop iterates over a smaller amount of data
which can be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to all the
languages supported by \s-1GCC\s0 and is not limited to Fortran.  To use this
code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has to be configured with \fB\-\-with\-ppl\fR
and \fB\-\-with\-cloog\fR to enable the Graphite loop transformation
infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-fgraphite\-identity\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgraphite-identity"
Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
\&\fB\-fgraphite\-identity\fR we can check the costs or benefits of the
\&\s-1GIMPLE \-\s0> \s-1GRAPHITE \-\s0> \s-1GIMPLE\s0 transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator CLooG, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-nest\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-nest-optimize"
Enable the \s-1ISL\s0 based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest
optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop
structure optimized for data-locality and parallelism.  This option
is experimental.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-parallelize\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-parallelize-all"
Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can
be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be analyzed to
not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it is
profitable to parallelize the loops.
.IP "\fB\-fcheck\-data\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcheck-data-deps"
Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.  This option
is used for debugging the data dependence analyzers.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-if\-convert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-if-convert"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-if\-convert\-stores\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores"
Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory writes.
This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded programs as it
transforms conditional memory writes into unconditional memory writes.
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
\&          if (cond)
\&            A[i] = expr;

.Vb 2
\&        for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
\&          A[i] = cond ? expr : A[i];
.Ve
.Sp
potentially producing data races.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-distribution\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-distribution"
Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          A(I) = B(I) + C
\&          D(I) = E(I) * F
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
is transformed to
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           A(I) = B(I) + C
\&        ENDDO
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           D(I) = E(I) * F
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-distribute\-patterns\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns"
Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
.Sp
This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&          A(I) = 0
\&          B(I) = A(I) + I
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
is transformed to
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           A(I) = 0
\&        ENDDO
\&        DO I = 1, N
\&           B(I) = A(I) + I
\&        ENDDO
.Ve
.Sp
and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset zero.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-im\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-im"
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
are hard to handle at \s-1RTL\s0 level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With \fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-ivcanon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-ivcanon"
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
.IP "\fB\-fivopts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fivopts"
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-parallelize\-loops=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-parallelize-loops=n"
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for \fB\-pthread\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-pta\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-pta"
Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sra"
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copyrename"
Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-inlined\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars"
Tell the copyrename pass (see \fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR) to attempt to
combine small user-defined variables too, but only if they were inlined
from other functions.  It is a more limited form of
\&\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR.  This may harm debug information of such
inlined variables, but it will keep variables of the inlined-into
function apart from each other, such that they are more likely to
contain the expected values in a debugging session.  This was the
default in \s-1GCC\s0 versions older than 4.7.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-vars"
Tell the copyrename pass (see \fB\-ftree\-copyrename\fR) to attempt to
combine small user-defined variables too, instead of just compiler
temporaries.  This may severely limit the ability to debug an optimized
program compiled with \fB\-fno\-var\-tracking\-assignments\fR.  In the
negated form, this flag prevents \s-1SSA\s0 coalescing of user variables,
including inlined ones.  This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ter"
Perform temporary expression replacement during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better \s-1RTL\s0 generation.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-slsr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-slsr"
Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes related
expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by less expensive
calculations when possible.  This is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vectorize"
Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables \fB\-ftree\-loop\-vectorize\fR
and \fB\-ftree\-slp\-vectorize\fR if not explicitly specified.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-vectorize"
Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O3\fR and when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-slp\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-slp-vectorize"
Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O3\fR and when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fvect\-cost\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvect-cost-model=model"
Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The \fImodel\fR argument
should be one of \f(CW\*(C`unlimited\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR.
With the \f(CW\*(C`unlimited\*(C'\fR model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR model a runtime check
will guard the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration
counts that will likely execute faster than when executing the original
scalar loop.  The \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR model will disable vectorization of
loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to
required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise
is equal to the \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR model.
The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is
either \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsimd\-cost\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsimd-cost-model=model"
Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP
or Cilk Plus simd directive.  The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of
\&\f(CW\*(C`unlimited\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cheap\*(C'\fR.  All values of \fImodel\fR
have the same meaning as described in \fB\-fvect\-cost\-model\fR and by
default a cost model defined with \fB\-fvect\-cost\-model\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vrp"
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if \fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR is
enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftracer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftracer"
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
a better job.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR.  This option makes code larger,
and may or may not make it run faster.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
\&\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR implies the same options as
\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR,
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-ivs\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"
Enables expression of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
A combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body
is more complicated than a single basic block.  It also does not work at all
on some architectures due to restrictions in the \s-1CSE\s0 pass.
.Sp
This optimization is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fvariable\-expansion\-in\-unroller\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller"
With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result in superior code.
.IP "\fB\-fpartial\-inlining\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpartial-inlining"
Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the \fB\-finline\-functions\fR

.Sp
Enabled at level \fB\-O2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fpredictive\-commoning\fR" 4

This option is enabled at level \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fprefetch\-loop\-arrays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprefetch-loop-arrays"
If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

.IP "\fB\-fno\-peephole2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-peephole2"
.PD
Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The difference
between \fB\-fno\-peephole\fR and \fB\-fno\-peephole2\fR is in how they
are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one, some use the
other, a few use both.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpeephole\fR is enabled by default.
\&\fB\-fpeephole2\fR enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-guess\-branch\-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-guess-branch-probability"
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR, then the heuristics are
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of \fB_\|_builtin_expect\fR are easier to understand.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fguess\-branch\-probability\fR at levels
\&\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-blocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-blocks"
Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to reduce number of
taken branches and improve code locality.

.IP "\fB\-freorder\-blocks\-and\-partition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-blocks-and-partition"
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and .o files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.
.Sp
This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined

.IP "\fB\-freorder\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-functions"
Reorder functions in the object file in order to
improve code locality.  This is implemented by using special
subsections \f(CW\*(C`.text.hot\*(C'\fR for most frequently executed functions and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.text.unlikely\*(C'\fR for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.
.Sp
Also profile feedback must be available to make this option effective.  See

.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;
\&        };
\&        
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called \*(L"type-punning\*(R") is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.    However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        int f() {
\&          double d = 3.0;
\&          return ((union a_union *) &d)\->i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR option is enabled at levels
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-overflow"
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it does not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler assumes
that an expression like \f(CW\*(C`i + 10 > i\*(C'\fR is always true for
signed \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`i + 10\*(C'\fR overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers 
overflows must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
.Sp
This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that \f(CW\*(C`p + u >
p\*(C'\fR is always true for a pointer \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR and unsigned integer
\&\f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if \f(CW\*(C`p + u\*(C'\fR overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.
.Sp
See also the \fB\-fwrapv\fR option.  Using \fB\-fwrapv\fR means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR is used, there is no difference between
\&\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR and \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR for
integers.  With \fB\-fwrapv\fR certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, but not otherwise.
.Sp
The \fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR option is enabled at levels
\&\fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fweb\fR" 4

Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as \s-1CSE,\s0 loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a
\&\*(L"home register\*(R".
.Sp
Enabled by default with \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fwhole\-program\fR" 4

Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
and those merged by attribute \f(CW\*(C`externally_visible\*(C'\fR become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.
.Sp
This option should not be used in combination with \f(CW\*(C`\-flto\*(C'\fR.
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.
.IP "\fB\-flto[=\fR\fIn\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto[=n]"
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates \s-1GIMPLE \s0(one of \s-1GCC\s0's internal
representations) and writes it to special \s-1ELF\s0 sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these \s-1ELF\s0 sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
.Sp
To use the link-time optimizer, \fB\-flto\fR and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
The first two invocations to \s-1GCC\s0 save a bytecode representation
of \s-1GIMPLE\s0 into special \s-1ELF\s0 sections inside \fIfoo.o\fR and
\&\fIbar.o\fR.  The final invocation reads the \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode from
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in \s-1GCC\s0 to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
\&\fIbar.o\fR into functions in \fIfoo.o\fR and vice-versa.
.Sp
Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.c bar.c
.Ve
.Sp
The above generates bytecode for \fIfoo.c\fR and \fIbar.c\fR,
merges them together into a single \s-1GIMPLE\s0 representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce \fImyprog\fR.
.Sp
The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to perform the link-step.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 then automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the \fB\-flto\fR.  You generally
should specify the optimization options to be used for link-time
optimization though \s-1GCC\s0 will try to be clever at guessing an
optimization level to use from the options used at compile-time
if you fail to specify one at link-time.  You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization at link-time
by passing \fB\-fno\-lto\fR to the link command.
.Sp
To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
.Sp
When \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR is not enabled then, when a file is
compiled with \fB\-flto\fR, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and the usual
final code (see \fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR.  This means that
object files with \s-1LTO\s0 information can be linked as normal object
files; if \fB\-fno\-lto\fR is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR is enabled the compile-stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.
.Sp
Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O0 \-ffat\-lto\-objects \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O0 \-ffat\-lto\-objects \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-O3 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary \fImyprog\fR is optimized at
\&\fB\-O3\fR.  If, instead, the final binary is generated with
\&\fB\-fno\-lto\fR, then \fImyprog\fR is not optimized.
.Sp
When producing the final binary, \s-1GCC\s0 only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and final object code.  \s-1GCC\s0 automatically selects
which files to optimize in \s-1LTO\s0 mode and which files to link without
further processing.
.Sp
There are some code generation flags preserved by \s-1GCC\s0 when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Generally options specified at link-time override those
specified at compile-time.
.Sp
If you do not specify an optimization level option \fB\-O\fR at
link-time then \s-1GCC\s0 will compute one based on the optimization levels
used when compiling the object files.  The highest optimization
level will win here.
.Sp
Currently, the following options and their setting are take from
the first object file that explicitely specified it: 
\&\fB\-fPIC\fR, \fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fcommon\fR,
\&\fB\-fexceptions\fR, \fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR, \fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR
and all the \fB\-m\fR target flags.
.Sp
Certain \s-1ABI\s0 changing flags are required to match in all compilation-units
and trying to override this at link-time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as \fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR
and \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR.
.Sp
Other options such as \fB\-ffp\-contract\fR, \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR,
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, \fB\-fno\-trapv\fR or \fB\-fno\-strict\-aliasing\fR
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
\&\fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR, \fB\-fwrapv\fR and \fB\-fno\-trapv\fR take
precedence and for example \fB\-ffp\-contract=off\fR takes precedence
over \fB\-ffp\-contract=fast\fR.  You can override them at linke-time.
.Sp
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.
.Sp
If \s-1LTO\s0 encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to \s-1ISO C99 6.2.7\s0), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.
.Sp
Another feature of \s-1LTO\s0 is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        gcc \-c \-flto foo.c
\&        g++ \-c \-flto bar.cc
\&        gfortran \-c \-flto baz.f90
\&        g++ \-o myprog \-flto \-O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o \-lgfortran
.Ve
.Sp
Notice that the final link is done with \fBg++\fR to get the \*(C+
runtime libraries and \fB\-lgfortran\fR is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in \s-1LTO\s0 mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.
.Sp
If object files containing \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
\&\fIlibfoo.a\fR, it is possible to extract and use them in an \s-1LTO\s0 link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for \s-1LTO,\s0 use \fBgcc-ar\fR and \fBgcc-ranlib\fR instead of \fBar\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`ranlib\*(C'\fR; to show the symbols of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode, use
\&\fBgcc-nm\fR.  Those commands require that \fBar\fR, \fBranlib\fR
and \fBnm\fR have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the the
flag \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR to ensure that the library participates in
the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-O2 \-flto \-fuse\-linker\-plugin a.o b.o \-lfoo
.Ve
.Sp
With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 files from \fIlibfoo.a\fR and passes them on to the running \s-1GCC\s0
to make them part of the aggregated \s-1GIMPLE\s0 image to be optimized.
.Sp
If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside \fIlibfoo.a\fR
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both \s-1LTO\s0 optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
\&\fB\-flto\fR \f(CW\*(C`\-ffat\-lto\-objects\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine \fB\-flto\fR and \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR).
.Sp
The current implementation of \s-1LTO\s0 makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
\&\s-1GCC\s0 will not work with an older or newer version of \s-1GCC.\s0
.Sp
Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining \fB\-flto\fR with
\&\fB\-g\fR is currently experimental and expected to produce unexpected
results.
.Sp
If you specify the optional \fIn\fR, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using \fIn\fR
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed \fBmake\fR program.  The
environment variable \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for \fIn\fR is 1.
.Sp
You can also specify \fB\-flto=jobserver\fR to use \s-1GNU\s0 make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling \s-1GCC\s0 is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a \fB+\fR to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR is
\&\s-1GNU\s0 make.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-partition=\fR\fIalg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-partition=alg"
Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
The value is either \f(CW\*(C`1to1\*(C'\fR to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or \f(CW\*(C`balanced\*(C'\fR to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is \f(CW\*(C`balanced\*(C'\fR. While \f(CW\*(C`1to1\*(C'\fR can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR
partitioning is intended for internal testing only.

This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate

Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in \s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer.
.Sp
This option enables the extraction of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-fwhole\-program\*(C'\fR.
See \fB\-flto\fR for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.
.Sp
This option is enabled by default when \s-1LTO\s0 support in \s-1GCC\s0 is enabled

Fat \s-1LTO\s0 objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language

and is ignored at link time.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR improves compilation time over plain \s-1LTO,\s0 but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of \s-1LTO.\s0 It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
\&\fBnm\fR, \fBar\fR and \fBranlib\fR
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  \s-1GCC\s0 provides the \fBgcc-ar\fR,

.IX Item "-fprofile-correction"
Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may
be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option is specified,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, \s-1GCC\s0 emits an error message when an inconsistent profile is detected.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-dir=\fR\fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-dir=path"
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to \fIpath\fR.
This option affects only the profile data generated by

and used by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR
and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 uses the current directory as \fIpath\fR, thus the

The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point 
arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ffloat\-store\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffloat-store"
Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.
.Sp
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point.  Use \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
.IP "\fB\-fexcess\-precision=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexcess-precision=style"
This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point registers have more precision than the \s-1IEEE
\&\s0\f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR types and the processor does not
support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=fast\fR is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is specified then excess
precision follows the rules specified in \s-1ISO C99\s0; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as \fB\-std=c99\fR is used.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is not implemented for languages
other than C, and has no effect if
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR or \fB\-ffast\-math\fR is
specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if \fB\-mfpmath=sse\fR
or \fB\-mfpmath=sse+387\fR is specified; in the former case, \s-1IEEE\s0
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.
.IP "\fB\-ffast\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffast-math"
Sets \fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR, \fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR,
\&\fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR, \fB\-fno\-rounding\-math\fR,
\&\fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR and \fB\-fcx\-limited\-range\fR.
.Sp
This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FAST_MATH_\|_\*(C'\fR to be defined.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option besides
\&\fB\-Ofast\fR since it can result in incorrect output for programs
that depend on an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-math-errno"
Do not set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., \f(CW\*(C`sqrt\*(C'\fR.  A program that relies on
\&\s-1IEEE\s0 exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic compatibility.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fmath\-errno\fR.
.Sp
On Darwin systems, the math library never sets \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and \fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR is the default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-math-optimizations"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate \s-1IEEE\s0 or
\&\s-1ANSI\s0 standards.  When used at link-time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default \s-1FPU\s0 control word or other
similar optimizations.

This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
Enables \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR, \fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR,

The default is \fB\-fno\-unsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fassociative\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fassociative-math"
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the \s-1ISO C\s0 and \*(C+ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
\&\f(CW\*(C`(x + 2**52) \- 2**52\*(C'\fR.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with \fB\-frounding\-math\fR. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR are in effect.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-associative\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freciprocal\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freciprocal-math"
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example \f(CW\*(C`x / y\*(C'\fR
can be replaced with \f(CW\*(C`x * (1/y)\*(C'\fR, which is useful if \f(CW\*(C`(1/y)\*(C'\fR
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-reciprocal\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffinite-math-only"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +\-Infs.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-finite\-math\-only\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-signed-zeros"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and \-0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with \fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fsigned\-zeros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-trapping-math"
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that \fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on \*(L"non-stop\*(R" \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic, for example.
.Sp
This option should never be turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-frounding\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frounding-math"
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point
rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fno\-rounding\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all \s-1GCC\s0 optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of \s-1GCC\s0 may provide finer control of this setting
using C99's \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR pragma.  This command-line option
will be used to specify the default state for \f(CW\*(C`FENV_ACCESS\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsignaling\-nans\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsignaling-nans"
Compile code assuming that \s-1IEEE\s0 signaling NaNs may generate user-visible
traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies \fB\-ftrapping\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_SUPPORT_SNAN_\|_\*(C'\fR to
be defined.

Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of
implicitly converting them to double-precision constants.
.IP "\fB\-fcx\-limited\-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcx-limited-range"
When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step is not
needed when performing complex division.  Also, there is no checking
whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is \f(CW\*(C`NaN
+ I*NaN\*(C'\fR, with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.  The
default is \fB\-fno\-cx\-limited\-range\fR, but is enabled by
\&\fB\-ffast\-math\fR.
.Sp
This option controls the default setting of the \s-1ISO C99

all languages.
.IP "\fB\-fcx\-fortran\-rules\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcx-fortran-rules"
Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.  Range
reduction is done as part of complex division, but there is no checking

section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-probabilities"
After running a program compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, you can compile it a second time using
\&\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When a program
compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR exits, it saves arc execution
counts to a file called \fI\fIsourcename\fI.gcda\fR for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 puts a
\&\fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR note on each \fB\s-1JUMP_INSN\s0\fR and \fB\s-1CALL_INSN\s0\fR.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in \fIreorg.c\fR, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the \fB\s-1REG_BR_PROB\s0\fR values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.
.IP "\fB\-fprofile\-values\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fprofile-values"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

Function reordering based on profile instrumentation collects
first time of execution of a function and orders these functions
in ascending order.

Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvpt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvpt"
If combined with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, this option instructs the compiler
to add code to gather information about values of expressions.
.Sp
With \fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operations
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
.IP "\fB\-frename\-registers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frename-registers"
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
most benefits processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in
a \*(L"home register\*(R".
.Sp
Enabled by default with \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR and \fB\-fpeel\-loops\fR.

Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-loops"
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR, \fB\-fweb\fR and \fB\-frename\-registers\fR.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.
.Sp
Enabled with \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR.
.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
\&\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR implies the same options as
\&\fB\-funroll\-loops\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fpeel\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpeel-loops"
Peels loops for which there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling

.IX Item "-fdata-sections"
.PD
Place each function or data item into its own section in the output

in the output file.
.Sp
Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the \s-1ELF\s0 object format and \s-1SPARC\s0 processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  \s-1AIX\s0 may have these optimizations in
the future.

Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker
create larger object and executable files and are also slower.
You cannot use \f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR on all systems if you

.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize"
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue

Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized

.IP "\fB\-fsection\-anchors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsection-anchors"
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared \*(L"anchor\*(R" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation

.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This

.IP "\fBmax-grow-copy-bb-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-grow-copy-bb-insns"
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-goto-duplication-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-goto-duplication-insns"
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, \s-1GCC\s0 factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions are searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-live-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-live-search"
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to

should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
.IP "\fBmax-gcse-memory\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-memory"
The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in

.IP "\fBmax-gcse-insertion-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-gcse-insertion-ratio"
If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value

.IP "\fBmax-pending-list-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-pending-list-length"
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows

needlessly consume memory and resources.
.IP "\fBmax-modulo-backtrack-attempts\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-modulo-backtrack-attempts"

internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (\*(C+).
The default value is 400.
.IP "\fBmax-inline-insns-auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-inline-insns-auto"
When you use \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 40.
.IP "\fBinline-min-speedup\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-min-speedup"
When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this
threshold (in precent), the function can be inlined regardless the limit on
\&\fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-single\fR and \fB\-\-param
max-inline-insns-auto\fR.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-insns"
The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
\&\fB\-\-param large-function-growth\fR.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.
The default value is 2700.
.IP "\fBlarge-function-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-unit-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-unit-insns"
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
For small units this might be too tight.
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\e% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to \fB\-\-param large-unit-insns\fR
before applying \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.  The default is 10000.
.IP "\fBinline-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.

size.
.IP "\fBipcp-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipcp-unit-growth"
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  The default value is 10 which limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame"
The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  The default value is 256 bytes.
.IP "\fBlarge-stack-frame-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-stack-frame-growth"
Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.

.IX Item "max-inline-insns-recursive-auto"
.PD
Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a
self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.
.Sp
For functions declared inline, \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive\fR is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-insns-recursive-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 450.

For functions declared inline, \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth\fR is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when \fB\-finline\-functions\fR (included in \fB\-O3\fR) is
enabled and \fB\-\-param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto\fR is used.  The
default value is 8.
.IP "\fBmin-inline-recursive-probability\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-inline-recursive-probability"
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.
.Sp
When profile feedback is available (see \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function recurses via a
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expressions
whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).
The default value is 10.
.IP "\fBearly-inlining-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "early-inlining-insns"
Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases

The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized
when \fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option

.IP "\fBgcse-cost-distance-ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "gcse-cost-distance-ratio"
Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than \fBgcse-unrestricted-cost\fR.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.
.IP "\fBgcse-unrestricted-cost\fR" 4
.IX Item "gcse-unrestricted-cost"
Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0 
allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
The default value is 3.
.IP "\fBmax-hoist-depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-hoist-depth"
The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm.

.IX Item "max-predicted-iterations"
The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound.
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
loop without bounds appears artificially cold relative to the other one.
.IP "\fBbuiltin-expect-probability\fR" 4

.PD
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.
.Sp
The \fBtracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback\fR is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.
.IP "\fBtracer-max-code-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "tracer-max-code-growth"
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
a rather artificial limit, as most of the duplicates are eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.

Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower than this
threshold.

Similarly to \fBtracer-dynamic-coverage\fR two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.
.IP "\fBmax-cse-path-length\fR" 4

.IP "\fBggc-min-expand\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-expand"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM \s0>= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\*(R"\s0 is
the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_DATA\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_AS\*(C'\fR.  If
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
\&\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
.IP "\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-heapsize"
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by \fBggc-min-expand\fR% beyond \fBggc-min-heapsize\fR.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is the smaller of \s-1RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS,\s0 or a limit that
tries to ensure that \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 or \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0 are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and \fBggc-min-expand\fR to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.

.IX Item "max-sched-ready-insns"
The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the scheduler should

bigger than \fBswitch-conversion-max-branch-ratio\fR times the number of
branches in the switch.
.IP "\fBmax-partial-antic-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-partial-antic-length"
Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (\fB\-ftree\-pre\fR) when
optimizing at \fB\-O3\fR and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.
.IP "\fBsccvn-max-scc-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "sccvn-max-scc-size"
Maximum size of a strongly connected component (\s-1SCC\s0) during \s-1SCCVN\s0
processing.  If this limit is hit, \s-1SCCVN\s0 processing for the whole
function is not done and optimizations depending on it are
disabled.  The default maximum \s-1SCC\s0 size is 10000.
.IP "\fBsccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access\fR" 4
.IX Item "sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access"
Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for
redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search
is aborted and the load or store is not considered redundant.  The
number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of
stores on all paths from the load to the function entry.
The default maxmimum number of queries is 1000.
.IP "\fBira-max-loops-num\fR" 4
.IX Item "ira-max-loops-num"
\&\s-1IRA\s0 uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most
the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.  The default value of the
parameter is 100.
.IP "\fBira-max-conflict-table-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "ira-max-conflict-table-size"
Although \s-1IRA\s0 uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in \s-1MB\s0 given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.  
The default value of the parameter is 2000.
.IP "\fBira-loop-reserved-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "ira-loop-reserved-regs"
\&\s-1IRA\s0 can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see \fB\-O3\fR).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  The default value of the parameter is 2, which is
the minimal number of registers needed by typical instructions.
This value is the best found from numerous experiments.
.IP "\fBloop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop"
Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.  The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for \fB\-O1\fR and 10000 for \fB\-O2\fR and above.
.IP "\fBloop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps"
Building data dapendencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops are no
handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.
The default value is 1000.
.IP "\fBmax-vartrack-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-vartrack-size"
Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.
.IP "\fBmax-vartrack-expr-depth\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-vartrack-expr-depth"
Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.  The default is 12.
.IP "\fBmin-nondebug-insn-uid\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-nondebug-insn-uid"
Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by

.IX Item "ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor"
IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new

pointer parameter.
.IP "\fBtm-max-aggregate-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "tm-max-aggregate-size"
When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables are
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
\&\fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR.
.IP "\fBgraphite-max-nb-scop-params\fR" 4
.IX Item "graphite-max-nb-scop-params"
To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters.  A variable whose value is unknown at
compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.
.IP "\fBgraphite-max-bbs-per-function\fR" 4
.IX Item "graphite-max-bbs-per-function"
To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the size of
the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The default value is
100 basic blocks.

.IX Item "loop-block-tile-size"
Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
\&\fB\-floop\-block\fR or \fB\-floop\-strip\-mine\fR, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the \fBloop-block-tile-size\fR
parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.
.IP "\fBipa-cp-value-list-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipa-cp-value-list-size"
IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization.
\&\fBipa-cp-value-list-size\fR is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.
.IP "\fBipa-cp-eval-threshold\fR" 4

the candidate.
.IP "\fBipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus"
When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make the index of

The default value is 32.
.IP "\fBlto-minpartition\fR" 4
.IX Item "lto-minpartition"
Size of minimal partition for \s-1WHOPR \s0(in estimated instructions).
This prevents expenses of splitting very small programs into too many

.IP "\fBcxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help"
The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions when \*(C+
name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.
.IP "\fBsink-frequency-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "sink-frequency-threshold"
The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement's original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking.
The default value is 75.  A small positive adjustment is applied for
statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.
.IP "\fBmax-stores-to-sink\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-stores-to-sink"
The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR) or if-conversion

unless implicitly set by the \fB\-fmemory\-model=\fR option.
.IP "\fBallow-packed-store-data-races\fR" 4
.IX Item "allow-packed-store-data-races"
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data stores.

unless implicitly set by the \fB\-fmemory\-model=\fR option.
.IP "\fBcase-values-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "case-values-threshold"
The smallest number of different values for which it is best to use a
jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.  If the value is
0, use the default for the machine.  The default is 0.
.IP "\fBtree-reassoc-width\fR" 4
.IX Item "tree-reassoc-width"
Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel in
reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target dependent
heuristics used by default if has non zero value.
.IP "\fBsched-pressure-algorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "sched-pressure-algorithm"
Choose between the two available implementations of
\&\fB\-fsched\-pressure\fR.  Algorithm 1 is the original implementation
and is the more likely to prevent instructions from being reordered.
Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise between the relatively
conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive
approach taken by the default scheduler.  It relies more heavily on
having a regular register file and accurate register pressure classes.
See \fIhaifa\-sched.c\fR in the \s-1GCC\s0 sources for more details.
.Sp
The default choice depends on the target.
.IP "\fBmax-slsr-cand-scan\fR" 4

Set the maximum number of existing candidates that will be considered when
seeking a basis for a new straight-line strength reduction candidate.
.IP "\fBasan-globals\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-globals"
Enable buffer overflow detection for global objects.  This kind
of protection is enabled by default if you are using

To disable global objects protection use \fB\-\-param asan\-globals=0\fR.
.IP "\fBasan-stack\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-stack"
Enable buffer overflow detection for stack objects.  This kind of

To disable memory writes protection use
\&\fB\-\-param asan\-instrument\-writes=0\fR option.
.IP "\fBasan-memintrin\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-memintrin"
Enable detection for built-in functions.  This kind of protection
is enabled by default when using \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR.
To disable built-in functions protection use
\&\fB\-\-param asan\-memintrin=0\fR.
.IP "\fBasan-use-after-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-use-after-return"
Enable detection of use-after-return.  This kind of protection

.IP "\fBasan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold"
If number of memory accesses in function being instrumented

.SS "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
.PP
If you use the \fB\-E\fR option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with \fB\-E\fR because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
.IP "\fB\-Wp,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wp,option"
You can use \fB\-Wp,\fR\fIoption\fR to bypass the compiler driver
and pass \fIoption\fR directly through to the preprocessor.  If
\&\fIoption\fR contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
\&\fB\-Wp\fR forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using \fB\-Wp\fR and let the driver handle the
options instead.
.IP "\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xpreprocessor option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not 
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
.IP "\fB\-no\-integrated\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-integrated-cpp"
Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(\fBcc1\fR, \fBcc1plus\fR, or \fBcc1obj\fR for C, \*(C+,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the \fB\-B\fR or
\&\fB\-wrapper\fR options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \f(CW1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name=definition"
The contents of \fIdefinition\fR are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a \fB#define\fR
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.
.Sp
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With \fBsh\fR and \fBcsh\fR,
\&\fB\-D'\fR\fIname\fR\fB(\fR\fIargs...\fR\fB)=\fR\fIdefinition\fR\fB'\fR works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR and

\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Cancel any previous definition of \fIname\fR, either built in or
provided with a \fB\-D\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I dir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by \fB\-I\fR are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory \fIdir\fR is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
\&.
If \fIdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Write output to \fIfile\fR.  This is the same as specifying \fIfile\fR
as the second non-option argument to \fBcpp\fR.  \fBgcc\fR has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use \fB\-o\fR to specify the output file.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is \fB\-Wcomment\fR, \fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR,
\&\fB\-Wmultichar\fR and a warning about integer promotion causing a

Warn whenever a comment-start sequence \fB/*\fR appears in a \fB/*\fR

(Both forms have the same effect.)
.IP "\fB\-Wtrigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wtrigraphs"
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (\fB??/\fR at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wall\fR.  If \fB\-Wall\fR is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other

Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
\&\fB#if\fR directive, outside of \fBdefined\fR.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
.IP "\fB\-Wunused\-macros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wunused-macros"
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is \fIused\fR if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.
.Sp
Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then \s-1CPP\s0 will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wendif\-labels\fR" 4

The second and third \f(CW\*(C`FOO\*(C'\fR should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
.IP "\fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsystem-headers"
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Suppress all warnings, including those which \s-1GNU CPP\s0 issues by default.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that \s-1GCC\s0 issues
without \fB\-pedantic\fR but treats as warnings.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.0 and earlier.
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.o: test.c test.h
\&        
\&        test.h:
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1

.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-preprocess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-preprocess"
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with \fB\-E\fR.  It inserts a special \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "\f(CIfilename\f(CW"\*(C'\fR in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its \fIfilename\fR.
When \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is in use, \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR
and loads the \s-1PCH.\s0
.Sp
This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to \s-1GCC. \s0 It is switched on by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
You should not write this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the \s-1PCH\s0 file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to \s-1GCC\s0's

Specify the source language: C, \*(C+, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has

.IX Item "-fdirectives-only"
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
.Sp
The option's behavior depends on the \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR
options.
.Sp
With \fB\-E\fR, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`#ifdef\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`#error\*(C'\fR.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the \fB\-dD\fR option is
implicitly enabled.
.Sp
With \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_LINE_\|_\*(C'\fR, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
With both \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, the rules for
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of

When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.
.IP "\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the

.IP "\fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR[\fB=\fR\fIlevel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]"
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The \fIlevel\fR parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value \fB0\fR of \fIlevel\fR de-activates
this option just as if no \fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR was present
on the command line. Value \fB1\fR tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value \fB2\fR tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
\&\fB2\fR.

.IX Item "-finput-charset=charset"
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by \s-1GCC. \s0 If the
locale does not specify, or \s-1GCC\s0 cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 This can be overridden by either the locale

supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives are emitted whatsoever.

Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a

source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.

Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is

In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro

.SS "Options for Linking"
.IX Subsection "Options for Linking"
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4

If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l library"
.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
.Sp
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Normally the files found this way are library files\-\-\-archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an \fB\-l\fR option and specifying a file name
is that \fB\-l\fR surrounds \fIlibrary\fR with \fBlib\fR and \fB.a\fR
and searches several directories.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostartfiles"
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as \f(CW\*(C`\-static\-libgcc\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-shared\-libgcc\*(C'\fR, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-static\-libgcc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-shared\-libgcc\*(C'\fR, are ignored.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
which \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is \fB_\|_main\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors are called.)
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a position independent executable on targets that support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
.IP "\fB\-rdynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rdynamic"
Pass the flag \fB\-export\-dynamic\fR to the \s-1ELF\s0 linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.[1]
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ and \s-1GCJ\s0 drivers automatically add
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because \*(C+ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it links the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or \s-1GCJ\s0 driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libasan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libasan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibasan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibasan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibasan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libasan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibasan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libtsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libtsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibtsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibtsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibtsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libtsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibtsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-liblsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-liblsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=leak\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBliblsan\fR.  If
\&\fIliblsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIliblsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-liblsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIliblsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libubsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libubsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=undefined\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibubsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibubsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibubsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libubsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibubsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libstdc++"
When the \fBg++\fR program is used to link a \*(C+ program, it
normally automatically links against \fBlibstdc++\fR.  If
\&\fIlibstdc++\fR is available as a shared library, and the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of \fIlibstdc++\fR.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of \fIlibstdc++\fR used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
\&\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR option directs the \fBg++\fR driver to
link \fIlibstdc++\fR statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T script"
Use \fIscript\fR as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the \fB\-T\fR option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.Sp
When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the \fIoption\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map=output.map\fR rather than
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map \-Xlinker output.map\fR.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, \fB\-Wl,\-Map,output.map\fR passes \fB\-Map output.map\fR to the
linker.  When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, you can also get the same effect with
\&\fB\-Wl,\-Map=output.map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u symbol"
Pretend the symbol \fIsymbol\fR is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use \fB\-u\fR multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
.SS "Options for Directory Search"
.IX Subsection "Options for Directory Search"
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
.IP "\fB\-I\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Idir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use \fB\-isystem\fR for that).  If you use more than
one \fB\-I\fR option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the \f(CW\*(C`include_next\*(C'\fR directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the \fB\-nostdinc\fR and/or \fB\-isystem\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-iplugindir=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iplugindir=dir"
Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by \fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIname\fR instead of
\&\fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIpath\fR\fB/\fR\fIname\fR\fB.so\fR.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.
.IP "\fB\-iquote\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iquotedir"
Add the directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of \fB#include
"\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR; they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR,
otherwise just like \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fBcpp\fR, \fBcc1\fR, \fBas\fR and \fBld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler checks to see if the path provided by the \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The runtime support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults which the \fBgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fBcc1\fR,
\&\fBcc1plus\fR, \fBas\fR, \fBld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.IP "\fB\-\-sysroot=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sysroot=dir"
Use \fIdir\fR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
\&\fI/usr/include\fR and libraries in \fI/usr/lib\fR, it instead
searches \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR and \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/lib\fR.
.Sp
If you use both this option and the \fB\-isysroot\fR option, then
the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option applies to libraries, but the
\&\fB\-isysroot\fR option applies to header files.
.Sp
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of \fB\-\-sysroot\fR still works, but the
library aspect does not.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sysroot\-suffix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sysroot-suffix"
For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with \fB\-\-sysroot\fR, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/\fIsuffix\fI/usr/include\fR instead of
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.
.IP "\fB\-I\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I-"
This option has been deprecated.  Please use \fB\-iquote\fR instead for
\&\fB\-I\fR directories before the \fB\-I\-\fR and remove the \fB\-I\-\fR.
Any directories you specify with \fB\-I\fR options before the \fB\-I\-\fR
option are searched only for the case of \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR;
they are not searched for \fB#include <\fR\fIfile\fR\fB>\fR.
.Sp
If additional directories are specified with \fB\-I\fR options after
the \fB\-I\-\fR, these directories are searched for all \fB#include\fR
directives.  (Ordinarily \fIall\fR \fB\-I\fR directories are used
this way.)
.Sp
In addition, the \fB\-I\-\fR option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for \fB#include "\fR\fIfile\fR\fB"\fR.  There is no way to
override this effect of \fB\-I\-\fR.  With \fB\-I.\fR you can specify
searching the directory that is current when the compiler is
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-I\-\fR does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, \fB\-I\-\fR and \fB\-nostdinc\fR are
independent.
.SS "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
.IX Subsection "Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version"
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fBgcc\fR, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\fR when cross-compiling, or

hardware models or configurations\-\-\-for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.

Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same

These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

are 32\-bit, and \fBlp64\fR for SysV-like data model where int is 32\-bit,
but long int and pointer are 64\-bit.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the \s-1LP64\s0 and \s-1ILP32\s0 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your
entire program with the same \s-1ABI,\s0 and link with a compatible set of libraries.

.IP "\fBfp\fR" 4

.IP "\fBsimd\fR" 4
.IX Item "simd"

\fIAdapteva Epiphany Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Adapteva Epiphany Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:
.IP "\fB\-mhalf\-reg\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhalf-reg-file"
Don't allocate any register in the range \f(CW\*(C`r32\*(C'\fR...\f(CW\*(C`r63\*(C'\fR.
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.
.IP "\fB\-mprefer\-short\-insn\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mprefer-short-insn-regs"
Preferrentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.
.IP "\fB\-mbranch\-cost=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbranch-cost=num"
Set the cost of branches to roughly \fInum\fR \*(L"simple\*(R" instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.
.IP "\fB\-mcmove\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmove"
Enable the generation of conditional moves.
.IP "\fB\-mnops=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mnops=num"
Emit \fInum\fR NOPs before every other generated instruction.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-cmpsf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-cmpsf"
For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an \f(CW\*(C`fsub\*(C'\fR instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is \fB\-msoft\-cmpsf\fR, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.
.IP "\fB\-mstack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstack-offset=num"
Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range \f(CW\*(C`sp+0...sp+7\*(C'\fR
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
Values other than \fB8\fR or \fB16\fR are untested and unlikely to work.
Note also that this option changes the \s-1ABI\s0; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work.
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate \fB\-\-with\-stack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-round\-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-round-nearest"
Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is \fB\-mround\-nearest\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mshort\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mshort-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR.
.IP "\fB\-msmall16\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall16"
Assume addresses can be loaded as 16\-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR semantics
are in effect.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-mode=\fR\fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-mode=mode"
Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.
.Sp
\&\fImode\fR can be set to one the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBcaller\fR" 4
.IX Item "caller"
Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 mode.
.IP "\fBtruncate\fR" 4
.IX Item "truncate"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.
.IP "\fBround-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "round-nearest"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.
.IP "\fBint\fR" 4
.IX Item "int"
This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the \s-1FPU,\s0 e.g.
integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.

.IP "\fB\-mnovect\-double\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mnovect-double"
Change the preferred \s-1SIMD\s0 mode to SImode.  The default is
\&\fB\-mvect\-double\fR, which uses DImode as preferred \s-1SIMD\s0 mode.
.IP "\fB\-max\-vect\-align=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-max-vect-align=num"
The maximum alignment for \s-1SIMD\s0 vector mode types.
\&\fInum\fR may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8.
Note that this is an \s-1ABI\s0 change, even though many library function
interfaces are unaffected if they don't use \s-1SIMD\s0 vector modes
in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.
.IP "\fB\-msplit\-vecmove\-early\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msplit-vecmove-early"
Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory this
can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
generally the case.
.IP "\fB\-m1reg\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m1reg-reg"
Specify a register to hold the constant \-1, which makes loading small negative
constants and certain bitmasks faster.
Allowable values for \fIreg\fR are \fBr43\fR and \fBr63\fR,
which specify use of that register as a fixed register,

to the full 32\-bit address range.
.IP "\fB\-mmedium\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmedium-calls"
Don't use less than 25 bit addressing range for calls, which is the
offset available for an unconditional branch-and-link
instruction.  Conditional execution of function calls is suppressed, to
allow use of the 25\-bit range, rather than the 21\-bit range with
conditional branch-and-link.  This is the default for tool chains built

generation driven by the combiner pass.
.IP "\fB\-mcase\-vector\-pcrel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcase-vector-pcrel"
Use pc-relative switch case tables \- this enables case table shortening.
This is the default for \fB\-Os\fR.

Enable compact casesi pattern.
This is the default for \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-cond\-exec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-cond-exec"
Disable ARCompact specific pass to generate conditional execution instructions.
Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand numbers,
literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support for conditional execution,
the target-independent pass to generate conditional execution is often lacking,
so the \s-1ARC\s0 port has kept a special pass around that tries to find more
conditional execution generating opportunities after register allocation,
branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have been done.  This pass
generally, but not always, improves performance and code size, at the cost of
extra compilation time, which is why there is an option to switch it off.
If you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable
offset range because they are conditionalized, you should consider using
\&\fB\-mmedium\-calls\fR instead.
.IP "\fB\-mearly\-cbranchsi\fR" 4

.IX Item "-mlra-priority-noncompact"
Reduce target regsiter priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-millicode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-millicode"
When optimizing for size (using \fB\-Os\fR), prologues and epilogues
that have to save or restore a large number of registers are often
shortened by using call to a special function in libgcc; this is
referred to as a \fImillicode\fR call.  As these calls can pose
performance issues, and/or cause linking issues when linking in a
nonstandard way, this option is provided to turn off millicode call
generation.

.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Advanced \s-1RISC\s0 Machines (\s-1ARM\s0)
architectures:
.IP "\fB\-mabi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabi=name"
Generate code for the specified \s-1ABI. \s0 Permissible values are: \fBapcs-gnu\fR,
\&\fBatpcs\fR, \fBaapcs\fR, \fBaapcs-linux\fR and \fBiwmmxt\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the \s-1ARM\s0 Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying \fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs"
This is a synonym for \fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mthumb-interwork"
Generate code that supports calling between the \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre\-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is \fB\-mno\-thumb\-interwork\fR, since slightly larger code
is generated when \fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR is specified.  In \s-1AAPCS\s0
configurations this option is meaningless.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-sched\-prolog\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-sched-prolog"
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is \fB\-msched\-prolog\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfloat\-abi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfloat-abi=name"
Specifies which floating-point \s-1ABI\s0 to use.  Permissible values
are: \fBsoft\fR, \fBsoftfp\fR and \fBhard\fR.
.Sp
Specifying \fBsoft\fR causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
\&\fBsoftfp\fR allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
\&\fBhard\fR allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same \s-1ABI,\s0 and link with a
compatible set of libraries.
.IP "\fB\-mlittle\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlittle-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
.IP "\fB\-mbig\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbig-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
.IP "\fB\-mwords\-little\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mwords-little-endian"
This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form \fB32107654\fR.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian \s-1ARM\s0 processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.  This option is now deprecated.
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-march=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.  Permissible names are: \fBarmv2\fR,
\&\fBarmv2a\fR, \fBarmv3\fR, \fBarmv3m\fR, \fBarmv4\fR, \fBarmv4t\fR,

.Sp
\&\fB\-march=armv7ve\fR is the armv7\-a architecture with virtualization

.Sp
\&\fB\-march=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the architecture
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect

.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=name"
This option specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor for
which \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the performance of the code.
For some \s-1ARM\s0 implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.
Permissible names are: \fBarm2\fR, \fBarm250\fR,

.Sp
Additionally, this option can specify that \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the performance
of the code for a big.LITTLE system.  Permissible names are:
\&\fBcortex\-a15.cortex\-a7\fR, \fBcortex\-a57.cortex\-a53\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the
performance for a blend of processors within architecture \fIarch\fR.
The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular
processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the
range, and avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of
this option may change in future \s-1GCC\s0 versions as \s-1CPU\s0 models come and go.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mtune=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the \s-1CPU\s0
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect is
unsuccessful the option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=name"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this name
to derive the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture (as if specified
by \fB\-march\fR) and the \s-1ARM\s0 processor type for which to tune for
performance (as if specified by \fB\-mtune\fR).  Where this option
is used in conjunction with \fB\-march\fR or \fB\-mtune\fR,
those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.
.Sp
Permissible names for this option are the same as those for
\&\fB\-mtune\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR is also permissible, and is
equivalent to \fB\-march=\fR\fIarch\fR \fB\-mtune=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR.
See \fB\-mtune\fR for more information.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mcpu=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the \s-1CPU\s0
of the build computer.  At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are recognized.  If the auto-detect
is unsuccessful the option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-mfpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfpu=name"
This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: \fBvfp\fR, \fBvfpv3\fR,
\&\fBvfpv3\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv3\-d16\fR, \fBvfpv3\-d16\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv3xd\fR,
\&\fBvfpv3xd\-fp16\fR, \fBneon\fR, \fBneon\-fp16\fR, \fBvfpv4\fR,
\&\fBvfpv4\-d16\fR, \fBfpv4\-sp\-d16\fR, \fBneon\-vfpv4\fR,
\&\fBfp\-armv8\fR, \fBneon\-fp\-armv8\fR, and \fBcrypto\-neon\-fp\-armv8\fR.
.Sp
If \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified this specifies the format of
floating-point values.
.Sp
If the selected floating-point hardware includes the \s-1NEON\s0 extension
(e.g. \fB\-mfpu\fR=\fBneon\fR), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by \s-1GCC\s0's auto-vectorization pass unless
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR is also specified.  This is
because \s-1NEON\s0 hardware does not fully implement the \s-1IEEE 754\s0 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of \s-1NEON\s0 instructions may lead to a loss of precision.
.IP "\fB\-mfp16\-format=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp16-format=name"
Specify the format of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR half-precision floating-point type.
Permissible names are \fBnone\fR, \fBieee\fR, and \fBalternative\fR;
the default is \fBnone\fR, in which case the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR type is not
defined.
.IP "\fB\-mstructure\-size\-boundary=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstructure-size-boundary=n"
The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the \s-1COFF\s0
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying \s-1ABI\s0 supports it.
.Sp
Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.
.IP "\fB\-mabort\-on\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabort-on-noreturn"
Generate a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR at the end of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR function.  It is executed if the function tries to
return.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64\-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the \fBshort-call\fR attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a \fB#pragma no_long_calls\fR directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the \fBlong-call\fR
attribute or the \fBsection\fR attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a \fB#pragma long_calls\fR directive are always
turned into long calls.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a \fB#pragma
long_calls_off\fR directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
.IP "\fB\-msingle\-pic\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msingle-pic-base"
Treat the register used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-register=\fR\fIreg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-register=reg"
Specify the register to be used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing.
For standard \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default will be any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default is
\&\fBR9\fR if target is \s-1EABI\s0 based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is \fBR10\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-data\-is\-text\-relative\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-data-is-text-relative"
Assume that each data segments are relative to text segment at load time.
Therefore, it permits addressing data using PC-relative operations.
This option is on by default for targets other than VxWorks \s-1RTP.\s0
.IP "\fB\-mpoke\-function\-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpoke-function-name"
Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:
.Sp
.Vb 9

.Sp
When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`pc\*(C'\fR stored at \f(CW\*(C`fp + 0\*(C'\fR.  If the trace function then looks at
location \f(CW\*(C`pc \- 12\*(C'\fR and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length \f(CW\*(C`((pc[\-3]) & 0xff000000)\*(C'\fR.

.PD
Select between generating code that executes in \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb

that executes in \s-1ARM\s0 state, but the default can be changed by
configuring \s-1GCC\s0 with the \fB\-\-with\-mode=\fR\fIstate\fR
configure option.
.IP "\fB\-mtpcs\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtpcs-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call

.IP "\fB\-mtpcs\-leaf\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtpcs-leaf-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-leaf\-frame\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mcallee\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcallee-super-interworking"
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an \s-1ARM\s0
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in \s-1AAPCS\s0 configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-mcaller\-super\-interworking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcaller-super-interworking"
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in \s-1AAPCS\s0 configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.
.IP "\fB\-mtp=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtp=name"
Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are \fBsoft\fR, which generates calls to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_aeabi_read_tp\*(C'\fR,
\&\fBcp15\fR, which fetches the thread pointer from \f(CW\*(C`cp15\*(C'\fR directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and \fBauto\fR, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
\&\fBauto\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mtls\-dialect=\fR\fIdialect\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtls-dialect=dialect"
Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
\&\fIdialect\fRs are supported\-\-\-\fBgnu\fR and \fBgnu2\fR.  The
\&\fBgnu\fR dialect selects the original \s-1GNU\s0 scheme for supporting
local and global dynamic \s-1TLS\s0 models.  The \fBgnu2\fR dialect
selects the \s-1GNU\s0 descriptor scheme, which provides better performance
for shared libraries.  The \s-1GNU\s0 descriptor scheme is compatible with
the original scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and
library support.  Initial and local exec \s-1TLS\s0 models are unaffected by
this option and always use the original scheme.
.IP "\fB\-mword\-relocations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mword-relocations"
Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e. R_ARM_ABS32).
This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime
loader imposes this restriction, and when \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR
is specified.
.IP "\fB\-mfix\-cortex\-m3\-ldrd\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd"
Some Cortex\-M3 cores can cause data corruption when \f(CW\*(C`ldrd\*(C'\fR instructions
with overlapping destination and base registers are used.  This option avoids

Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release the needed

Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on

executables because arguments need not to be removed from the

Setting \f(CW\*(C`\-mrelax\*(C'\fR just adds the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-relax\*(C'\fR option to the
linker command line when the linker is called.
.Sp
Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets are not
known before code is located. Therefore, the assembler code generated by the
compiler is the same, but the instructions in the executable may
differ from instructions in the assembler code.
.Sp
Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see the

Treat the stack pointer register as an 8\-bit register,
i.e. assume the high byte of the stack pointer is zero.
In general, you don't need to set this option by hand.
.Sp
This option is used internally by the compiler to select and
build multilibs for architectures \f(CW\*(C`avr2\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`avr25\*(C'\fR.
These architectures mix devices with and without \f(CW\*(C`SPH\*(C'\fR.
For any setting other than \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=avr2\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-mmcu=avr25\*(C'\fR
the compiler driver will add or remove this option from the compiler
proper's command line, because the compiler then knows if the device
or architecture has an 8\-bit stack pointer and thus no \f(CW\*(C`SPH\*(C'\fR
register or not.
.IP "\fB\-mstrict\-X\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstrict-X"
Use address register \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR in a way proposed by the hardware.  This means
that \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR is only used in indirect, post-increment or
pre-decrement addressing.

\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash
.IX Subsection "EIND and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash"
.PP
Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64@tie{}Ki words.
.PP
In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
\&\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR that serves as most significant part of the target address
when \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR instructions are used.
.PP
Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR implicitely in \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR
instructions or might read \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a \f(CW\*(C`RET\*(C'\fR instruction.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The compiler assumes that \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates \fIstubs\fR. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
\&\fItrampolines\fR. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker will generate
the stubs correctly an all situaltion. See the compiler option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-mrelax\*(C'\fR and the linler option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-relax\*(C'\fR.
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The default linker script is arranged for code with \f(CW\*(C`EIND = 0\*(C'\fR.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with \f(CW\*(C`EIND != 0\*(C'\fR, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with \f(CW\*(C`.trampolines\*(C'\fR into the segment where \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
points to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The startup code from libgcc never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
For the impact of AVR-LibC on \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR, see the
AVR-LibC\ user\ manual (\f(CW\*(C`http://nongnu.org/avr\-libc/user\-manual/\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section \f(CW\*(C`.init3\*(C'\fR. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes \s-1RAM\s0 and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR to the segment
where the vector table is located.

.IX Subsection "Handling of the RAMPD, RAMPX, RAMPY and RAMPZ Special Function Registers"
.PP
Some \s-1AVR\s0 devices support memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range
that can be accessed with 16\-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the contentent of a \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR
register is used as high part of the address:
The \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR address register is concatenated
with the \f(CW\*(C`RAMPX\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPY\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
\&\f(CW\*(C`RAMPD\*(C'\fR is used together with direct addressing.
.IP "\(bu" 4

registers with zero.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If a \fB\s-1AVR\s0 Named Address Spaces,named address space\fR other than
generic or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_flash\*(C'\fR is used, then \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR is set
as needed before the operation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the device supports \s-1RAM\s0 larger than 64@tie{}KiB and the compiler
needs to change \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR to accomplish an operation, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR
is reset to zero after the operation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If the device comes with a specific \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR register, the \s-1ISR\s0
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that \s-1SFR\s0 and initializes it with
zero in case the \s-1ISR\s0 code might (implicitly) use it.

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library \s-1ID\s0 method,

.IP "\fB\-mshared\-library\-id=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mshared-library-id=n"
Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being

\fIDarwin Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Darwin Options"
.PP
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
.PP
\&\s-1FSF GCC\s0 on Darwin does not create \*(L"fat\*(R" object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that \s-1GCC\s0 was built to
target.  Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does create \*(L"fat\*(R" files if multiple
\&\fB\-arch\fR options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
\&\fIlipo\fR.
.PP
The subtype of the file created (like \fBppc7400\fR or \fBppc970\fR or
\&\fBi686\fR) is determined by the flags that specify the \s-1ISA\s0
that \s-1GCC\s0 is targeting, like \fB\-mcpu\fR or \fB\-march\fR.  The
\&\fB\-force_cpusubtype_ALL\fR option can be used to override this.
.PP
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an \s-1ISA\s0
mismatch.  The assembler, \fIas\fR, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64\-bit instructions in a \fBppc750\fR object file.
The linker for shared libraries, \fI/usr/bin/libtool\fR, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a \fBppc970\fR object file in a \fBppc7400\fR library).  The linker
for executables, \fBld\fR, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Fdir"
Add the framework directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by \fB\-I\fR options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.
.Sp
A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a \fIHeaders\fR and/or
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR directory contained directly in it that ends
in \fI.framework\fR.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the \fI.framework\fR.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
\&\fIHeaders\fR being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's \fIFrameworks\fR directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in \fI/System/Library/Frameworks\fR and
\&\fI/Library/Frameworks\fR.  An example include looks like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include <Framework/header.h>\*(C'\fR, where \fIFramework\fR denotes
the name of the framework and \fIheader.h\fR is found in the
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR or \fIHeaders\fR directory.
.IP "\fB\-iframework\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iframeworkdir"
Like \fB\-F\fR except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this \fB\-iframework\fR and
\&\fB\-F\fR is that with \fB\-iframework\fR the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
\&\fIdir\fR.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.
.IP "\fB\-gused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gused"
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
debugging format, this enables \fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR.
This is by default \s-1ON.\s0
.IP "\fB\-gfull\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gfull"
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.
.IP "\fB\-mmacosx\-version\-min=\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmacosx-version-min=version"

is \fIversion\fR.  Typical values of \fIversion\fR include \f(CW10.1\fR,
\&\f(CW10.2\fR, and \f(CW10.3.9\fR.
.Sp
If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.
.IP "\fB\-mkernel\fR" 4

\&\fB\-fapple\-kext\fR, \fB\-fno\-weak\fR and \fB\-fno\-rtti\fR where
applicable.  This mode also sets \fB\-mno\-altivec\fR,
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR, \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR and
\&\fB\-mlong\-branch\fR for PowerPC targets.
.IP "\fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mone-byte-bool"
Override the defaults for \fBbool\fR so that \fBsizeof(bool)==1\fR.
By default \fBsizeof(bool)\fR is \fB4\fR when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and \fB1\fR when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR The \fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this

\fI\s-1DEC\s0 Alpha Options\fR
.IX Subsection "DEC Alpha Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for the \s-1DEC\s0 Alpha implementations:
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-float"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified,
functions in \fIlibgcc.a\fR are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.
.Sp
Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-reg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-regs"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR implies \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in \f(CW$0\fR instead of \f(CW$f0\fR.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with \fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR must also be compiled with that
option.
.Sp
A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee"
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
\&\fIexcept\fR that the \fIinexact-flag\fR is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional \s-1IEEE\s0
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option \fB\-ieee_with_no_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-with\-inexact\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-with-inexact"
This is like \fB\-mieee\fR except the generated code also maintains
the \s-1IEEE \s0\fIinexact-flag\fR.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant \s-1IEEE\s0 math.  In addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP_EXACT\*(C'\fR is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the \fIinexact-flag\fR, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option \fB\-ieee_with_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=\fR\fItrap-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode"
This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
Other Alpha compilers call this option \fB\-fptm\fR \fItrap-mode\fR.
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).
.IP "\fBu\fR" 4
.IX Item "u"
In addition to the traps enabled by \fBn\fR, underflow traps are enabled
as well.
.IP "\fBsu\fR" 4
.IX Item "su"
Like \fBu\fR, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).
.IP "\fBsui\fR" 4
.IX Item "sui"
Like \fBsu\fR, but inexact traps are enabled as well.

.IP "\fB\-mfp\-rounding\-mode=\fR\fIrounding-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-rounding-mode=rounding-mode"
Selects the \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
\&\fB\-fprm\fR \fIrounding-mode\fR.  The \fIrounding-mode\fR can be one
of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Normal \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.
.IP "\fBm\fR" 4
.IX Item "m"
Round towards minus infinity.
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(\fIfpcr\fR, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
\&\fIfpcr\fR, \fBd\fR corresponds to round towards plus infinity.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-mtrap\-precision=\fR\fItrap-precision\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtrap-precision=trap-precision"
In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "p"
Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBi\fR" 4
.IX Item "i"
Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
\&\fB\-scope_safe\fR and \fB\-resumption_safe\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-conformant\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-conformant"
This option marks the generated code as \s-1IEEE\s0 conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify \fB\-mtrap\-precision=i\fR and either
\&\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=su\fR or \fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=sui\fR.  Its only effect
is to emit the line \fB.eflag 48\fR in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.
.IP "\fB\-mbuild\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbuild-constants"
Normally \s-1GCC\s0 examines a 32\- or 64\-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.
.Sp
Use this option to require \s-1GCC\s0 to construct \fIall\fR integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).
.Sp
You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

Indicate whether \s-1GCC\s0 should generate code to use the optional \s-1BWX,
CIX, FIX\s0 and \s-1MAX\s0 instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction
sets supported by the \s-1CPU\s0 type specified via \fB\-mcpu=\fR option or that

.IX Item "-mexplicit-relocs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-explicit\-relocs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-explicit-relocs"
.PD
Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  \s-1GNU\s0 binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as \s-1GCC\s0 detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.
.IP "\fB\-msmall\-data\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall-data"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mlarge\-data\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlarge-data"
.PD
When \fB\-mexplicit\-relocs\fR is in effect, static data is
accessed via \fIgp-relative\fR relocations.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a \fIsmall data area\fR
(the \f(CW\*(C`.sdata\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.sbss\*(C'\fR sections) and are accessed via
16\-bit relocations off of the \f(CW$gp\fR register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.
.Sp
When generating code for shared libraries, \fB\-fpic\fR implies
\&\fB\-msmall\-data\fR and \fB\-fPIC\fR implies \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.
.IP "\fB\-msmall\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall-text"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mlarge\-text\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlarge-text"
.PD
When \fB\-msmall\-text\fR is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same \f(CW$gp\fR value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-text\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIcpu_type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=cpu_type"
Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type \fIcpu_type\fR.  You can specify either the \fB\s-1EV\s0\fR
style name or the corresponding chip number.  \s-1GCC\s0 supports scheduling
parameters for the \s-1EV4, EV5\s0 and \s-1EV6\s0 family of processors and
chooses the default values for the instruction set from the processor
you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, \s-1GCC\s0 defaults

Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.
.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-fpregs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-fpregs"
Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context switching of
floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.
.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-indexing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-indexing"
Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling \s-1MIG\s0 generated code under \s-1MACH.\s0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-space\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-space-regs"
Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.
.Sp
Such code is suitable for level 0 \s-1PA\s0 systems and kernels.
.IP "\fB\-mfast\-indirect\-calls\fR" 4

.Sp
This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.
.IP "\fB\-mfixed\-range=\fR\fIregister-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfixed-range=register-range"
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-load\-store\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-load-store"
Generate 3\-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the \fB+k\fR option to

proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
\&\fB8000\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlinker\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlinker-opt"
Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1HPPA\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC,\s0 with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-msio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msio"
Generate the predefine, \f(CW\*(C`_SIO\*(C'\fR, for server \s-1IO. \s0 The default is
\&\fB\-mwsio\fR.  This generates the predefines, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_hp9000s700\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_hp9000s700_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_WSIO\*(C'\fR, for workstation \s-1IO. \s0 These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.
.IP "\fB\-mgnu\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgnu-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1GNU \s0\fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-shared\fR to \fBld\fR when
building a shared library.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  This option does not
affect which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that \fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the
\&\fB\-\-with\-ld\fR configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and
finally by the user's \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed
using \fBwhich `gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available
on the 64\-bit HP-UX \s-1GCC,\s0 i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mhp\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhp-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1HP \s0\fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-b\fR to \fBld\fR when building
a shared library and passes \fB+Accept TypeMismatch\fR to \fBld\fR on all
links.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the \s-1HP\s0 linker.  This option does not affect
which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
\&\fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the \fB\-\-with\-ld\fR
configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and finally by the user's
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed using \fBwhich
`gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available on the 64\-bit
HP-UX \s-1GCC,\s0 i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
\&\s-1PA 2.0\s0 and \s-1PA 1.X\s0 architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.
.Sp
Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
\&\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR option, or when using the \fB\-mgas\fR
and \fB\-mno\-portable\-runtime\fR options together under HP-UX with
the \s-1SOM\s0 linker.
.Sp
It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.
.Sp
The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
.IP "\fB\-munix=\fR\fIunix-std\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munix=unix-std"
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 standard.  The choices for \fIunix-std\fR are \fB93\fR, \fB95\fR
and \fB98\fR.  \fB93\fR is supported on all HP-UX versions.  \fB95\fR
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  \fB98\fR is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are \fB93\fR for HP-UX 10.00,
\&\fB95\fR for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and \fB98\fR for HP-UX 11.11
and later.
.Sp
\&\fB\-munix=93\fR provides the same predefines as \s-1GCC 3.3\s0 and 3.4.
\&\fB\-munix=95\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix95.o\fR.
\&\fB\-munix=98\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_\|_STDC_A1_SOURCE\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix98.o\fR.
.Sp
It is \fIimportant\fR to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, \fIextreme\fR care is needed in using this
option.
.Sp
Library code that is intended to operate with more than one \s-1UNIX\s0
standard must test, set and restore the variable \fI_\|_xpg4_extended_mask\fR
as appropriate.  Most \s-1GNU\s0 software doesn't provide this capability.
.IP "\fB\-nolibdld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nolibdld"
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.
.Sp
On HP-UX 10 and later, the \s-1GCC\s0 driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64\-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
\&\fB\-nolibdld\fR option can be used to prevent the \s-1GCC\s0 driver from
adding these link options.
.IP "\fB\-threads\fR" 4
.IX Item "-threads"
Add support for multithreading with the \fIdce thread\fR library

.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

.IX Item "-mcld"
This option instructs \s-1GCC\s0 to emit a \f(CW\*(C`cld\*(C'\fR instruction in the prologue
of functions that use string instructions.  String instructions depend on
the \s-1DF\s0 flag to select between autoincrement or autodecrement mode.  While the
\&\s-1ABI\s0 specifies the \s-1DF\s0 flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
systems violate this specification by not clearing the \s-1DF\s0 flag in their
exception dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the \s-1DF\s0 flag
set, which leads to wrong direction mode when string instructions are used.
This option can be enabled by default on 32\-bit x86 targets by configuring
\&\s-1GCC\s0 with the \fB\-\-enable\-cld\fR configure option.  Generation of \f(CW\*(C`cld\*(C'\fR

.IP "\fB\-msahf\fR" 4

This option enables generation of \f(CW\*(C`SAHF\*(C'\fR instructions in 64\-bit code.
Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64 support,

which were supported by \s-1AMD64.\s0
These are load and store instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.

Note that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be

Use \s-1PUSH\s0 operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter

improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.
.IP "\fB\-maccumulate\-outgoing\-args\fR" 4

If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments is

When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code

processors, this option is not needed; \fB\-fPIC\fR suffices.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT.\s0
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar
.Ve

If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with

the value of a global symbol.

The special value \fBfrom-abi\fR selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected \s-1ABI \s0(that is,
\&\fBmips1\fR for 32\-bit ABIs and \fBmips3\fR for 64\-bit ABIs).
.Sp
The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value \fBnative\fR,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
\&\fB\-march=native\fR has no effect if \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize
the processor.
.Sp
In processor names, a final \fB000\fR can be abbreviated as \fBk\fR
(for example, \fB\-march=r2k\fR).  Prefixes are optional, and
\&\fBvr\fR may be written \fBr\fR.
.Sp
Names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
\&\fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form \fIn\fR\fBf3_2\fR refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, \fIn\fR\fBf\fR is accepted as a synonym
for \fIn\fR\fBf2_1\fR while \fIn\fR\fBx\fR and \fIb\fR\fBfx\fR are
accepted as synonyms for \fIn\fR\fBf1_1\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form \fB_MIPS_ARCH_\fR\fIfoo\fR,
where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR sets \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR
to \fB\*(L"r2000\*(R"\fR and defines the macro \fB_MIPS_ARCH_R2000\fR.
.Sp
Note that the \fB_MIPS_ARCH\fR macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate \fB000\fR as \fBk\fR.  In the case of \fBfrom-abi\fR,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either \fB\*(L"mips1\*(R"\fR or
\&\fB\*(L"mips3\*(R"\fR).  It names the default architecture when no
\&\fB\-march\fR option is given.
.IP "\fB\-mtune=\fR\fIarch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtune=arch"

.Sp
When this option is not used, \s-1GCC\s0 optimizes for the processor
specified by \fB\-march\fR.  By using \fB\-march\fR and
\&\fB\-mtune\fR together, it is possible to generate code that

.Sp
All \fB\-mabicalls\fR code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like \fB\-fPIC\fR and \fB\-fpic\fR.  However,
as an extension, the \s-1GNU\s0 toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter \s-1GP\s0
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by \fB\-mno\-shared\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mno\-shared\fR depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  However, the option
does not affect the \s-1ABI\s0 of the final executable; it only affects the \s-1ABI\s0

executables both smaller and quicker.

Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global

.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT.\s0
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

.IP "\fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting"
Specify whether \s-1GCC\s0 should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.
.Sp
In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the \*(L"taken\*(R" branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.
.Sp
This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a \s-1DMA\s0 operation writes to the
same area of memory before the \*(L"dirty\*(R" line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.
.Sp
One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  \fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR
controls \s-1GCC\s0's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;
.IP "2." 4
the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;
.IP "3." 4
the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.
.Sp
If the input program contains a function declaration such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        void foo (void);
.Ve
.Sp
then the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR must allow \f(CW\*(C`j foo\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`jal foo\*(C'\fR to be executed speculatively.  \s-1GCC\s0 honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.
.Sp
The option has three forms:
.IP "\fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=load\-store\fR" 4

When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally safe

warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the \s-1MAC AE\s0 type.  The \s-1MAC AE\s0 has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate
that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an \s-1AE\s0 type that has the necessary hardware support.  This option disables
these warnings.

On \s-1AIX,\s0 the \fB\-maltivec\fR and \fB\-mpowerpc64\fR options are
not enabled or disabled by the \fB\-mcpu\fR option at present because

Modify generation of the \s-1TOC \s0(Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The \fB\-mfull\-toc\fR option is selected by
default.  In that case, \s-1GCC\s0 allocates at least one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  \s-1GCC\s0
also places floating-point constants in the \s-1TOC. \s0 However, only
16,384 entries are available in the \s-1TOC.\s0

If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available \s-1TOC\s0 space, you can reduce the amount of \s-1TOC\s0 space used
with the \fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR options.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run time instead of putting that sum into the \s-1TOC. \s0 You may specify one

slower and larger code at the expense of conserving \s-1TOC\s0 space.
.Sp
If you still run out of space in the \s-1TOC\s0 even when you specify both of
these options, specify \fB\-mminimal\-toc\fR instead.  This option causes
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to make only one \s-1TOC\s0 entry for every file.  When you specify this

By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call is generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the \f(CW\*(C`shortcall\*(C'\fR function attribute, or by \f(CW\*(C`#pragma
longcall(0)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the \s-1AIX\s0 linker can do this,
as can the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the \s-1GNU\s0 linker for 32\-bit PowerPC systems as well.
.Sp
On Darwin/PPC systems, \f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall\*(C'\fR generates \f(CW\*(C`jbsr
callee, L42\*(C'\fR, plus a \fIbranch island\fR (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a \f(CW\*(C`bl
callee\*(C'\fR if the \s-1PPC \s0\f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates \f(CW\*(C`bl L42\*(C'\fR to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32\-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.
.Sp
On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.

In the future, \s-1GCC\s0 may ignore all longcall specifications

.IP "\fB\-mrecip=\fR\fIopt\fR" 4

.IX Item "-msmall-data-limit=N"
Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the \s-1RX\s0's
registers (usually \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register.
.Sp
Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.
.Sp
The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(\fB\-O2\fR etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and

.IX Item "-mmax-constant-size=N"
Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a \s-1RX\s0 instruction.  Although the \s-1RX\s0 instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.
.Sp
The value \fIN\fR can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)

.IX Item "-mint-register=N"
Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value \fIN\fR can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR is reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`r12\*(C'\fR.  A value of 3 reserves \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`r12\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`r11\*(C'\fR, and a value of 4 reserves \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR through \f(CW\*(C`r10\*(C'\fR.
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.
.IP "\fB\-msave\-acc\-in\-interrupts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msave-acc-in-interrupts"
Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64\-bit

Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.
.Sp
Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.
.Sp
The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the \fB\-msmall\-data\-limit\fR and/or the
\&\fB\-mint\-register\fR command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register \f(CW\*(C`r13\*(C'\fR and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of \fB\-mint\-register\fR,
then \fB\-mpid\fR and finally \fB\-msmall\-data\-limit\fR.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be \f(CW\*(C`r8\*(C'\fR if both
\&\fB\-mint\-register=4\fR and \fB\-mpid\fR are specified on the
command line.

Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer

A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand

save area.
.Sp
In general, code compiled with \fB\-mbackchain\fR is call-compatible with

Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is

area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when \fB\-mbackchain\fR is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.
.Sp
As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with

from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable
for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when
the target is \f(CW\*(C`sh*\-*\-linux*\*(C'\fR and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is \s-1SH4A,\s0
this option will also partially utilize the hardware atomic instructions

.IP "\fBsoft-tcb\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-tcb"
Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control

SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the \fBgbr\-offset=\fR

.IP "\fBsoft-imask\fR" 4
.IX Item "soft-imask"
Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by
setting \f(CW\*(C`SR.IMASK = 1111\*(C'\fR.  This model works only when the program runs

Generate hardware atomic sequences using the \f(CW\*(C`movli.l\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`movco.l\*(C'\fR
instructions only.  This is only available on \s-1SH4A\s0 and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.
Code compiled with this option will also be compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an \s-1SH4A\s0

For SHmedia \fIstrategy\fR can be one of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBfp\fR" 4
.IX Item "fp"
Performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily-exploitable \s-1ILP\s0 to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating-point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.
.IP "\fBinv\fR" 4
.IX Item "inv"
Uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
\&\s-1CSE\s0 and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
.IP "\fBinv:minlat\fR" 4
.IX Item "inv:minlat"
A variant of \fBinv\fR where, if no \s-1CSE\s0 or hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
.IP "\fBcall\fR" 4
.IX Item "call"
Calls a library function that usually implements the \fBinv:minlat\fR
strategy.
This gives high code density for \f(CW\*(C`m5\-*media\-nofpu\*(C'\fR compilations.
.IP "\fBcall2\fR" 4
.IX Item "call2"
Uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it

Use the \fBinv\fR algorithm for initial
code generation, but if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the \fBcall\fR,
\&\fBcall2\fR, or \fBfp\fR strategies, respectively.  Note that the
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to floating-point operations or a call is not possible
in that case.
.IP "\fBinv20u\fR" 4

.PD
Variants of the \fBinv:minlat\fR strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation is not separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable)
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  \fBinv20u\fR assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and \fBinv20l\fR assumes it to be likely.

SH2A\s0 and SHcompact.
.IP "\fBcall-fp\fR" 4

floating point.  Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is

.IP "\fBcall-table\fR" 4
.IX Item "call-table"
Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and
the \f(CW\*(C`div1\*(C'\fR instruction with case distinction for larger divisors.  Division
by zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default

When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy will be

Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or \s-1OS\s0 implement 32\-bit wrap-around

.IP "\fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpt-fixed"
Assume \f(CW\*(C`pt*\*(C'\fR instructions won't trap.  This generally generates
better-scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.
The current architecture
definition says that \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR trap when the target 
anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule these
instructions before a branch, or hoist them out of a loop.  For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_do_global_ctors\*(C'\fR, a part of \fIlibgcc\fR
that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by \-1.  With the
\&\fB\-mpt\-fixed\fR option, the \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR is done before testing against \-1.
That means that all the constructors run a bit more quickly, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR
loads \-1 into a target register.
.Sp
Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR.  Unless specified explicitly with 
\&\fB\-mgettrcost\fR, \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR also implies \fB\-mgettrcost=100\fR;
this deters register allocation from using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.

\&\f(CW\*(C`movi\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`shori\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR,
but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that cause \f(CW\*(C`ptabs\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`ptrel\*(C'\fR to trap.
This option is only meaningful when \fB\-mno\-pt\-fixed\fR is in effect.

However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the

These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:
.IP "\fB\-pthreads\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pthreads"
Add support for multithreading using the \s-1POSIX\s0 threads library.  This
option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.  This option does
not affect the thread safety of object code produced  by the compiler or

.IP "\fB\-mno\-app\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-app-regs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mapp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapp-regs"
.PD
Specify \fB\-mapp\-regs\fR to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the \s-1SPARC SVR4 ABI\s0 reserves for applications.  Like the
global register 1, each global register 2 through 4 is then treated as an
allocable register that is clobbered by function calls.  This is the default.
.Sp
To be fully \s-1SVR4\s0 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify \fB\-mno\-app\-regs\fR.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.
.IP "\fB\-mflat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mflat"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-flat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-flat"
.PD
With \fB\-mflat\fR, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a \*(L"flat\*(R" or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0\-\-5) are still treated as \*(L"call-saved\*(R" registers and are
saved on the stack as needed.
.Sp
With \fB\-mno\-flat\fR (the default), the compiler generates save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal operating mode.
.IP "\fB\-mfpu\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfpu"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mhard\-float\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mno\-fpu\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fpu"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1SPARC\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets \fBsparc\-*\-aout\fR and
\&\fBsparclite\-*\-*\fR do provide software floating-point support.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the
library that comes with \s-1GCC,\s0 with \fB\-msoft\-float\fR in order for
this to work.
.IP "\fB\-mhard\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhard-quad-float"
Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
instructions.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-quad-float"
Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the \s-1SPARC ABI. \s0 This is the default.
.Sp
As of this writing, there are no \s-1SPARC\s0 implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the \s-1ABI\s0 library routines.  Thus the
\&\fB\-msoft\-quad\-float\fR option is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-unaligned\-doubles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-unaligned-doubles"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munaligned-doubles"
.PD
Assume that doubles have 8\-byte alignment.  This is the default.
.Sp
With \fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 assumes that doubles have 8\-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4\-byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating-point code.
.IP "\fB\-muser\-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-muser-mode"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-user\-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-user-mode"
.PD
Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.  This is relevant
only for the \f(CW\*(C`casa\*(C'\fR instruction emitted for the \s-1LEON3\s0 processor.  The
default is \fB\-mno\-user\-mode\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-faster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-faster-structs"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfaster-structs"
.PD
With \fB\-mfaster\-structs\fR, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8\-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
\&\f(CW\*(C`ldd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`std\*(C'\fR instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`st\*(C'\fR pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the \s-1SPARC
ABI. \s0 Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with
the rules of the \s-1ABI.\s0

.PD
Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict \s-1IEEE\s0 754\-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with \fImore\fR bits of
precision than specified by the \s-1IEEE\s0 standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not

Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
\&\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR, which places literals in a separate

in a data \s-1RAM/ROM,\s0 and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With \fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR, the literals

.IX Item "-mtarget-align"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-target\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-target-align"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
default is \fB\-mtarget\-align\fR.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like \f(CW\*(C`LOOP\*(C'\fR, which the

.IX Item "-mlongcalls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-longcalls"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct \f(CW\*(C`CALL\*(C'\fR
instruction into an \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR followed by a \f(CW\*(C`CALLX\*(C'\fR instruction.
The default is \fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by \s-1GCC\s0 still shows direct call
instructions\-\-\-look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

.IP "\fB\-fstack\-reuse=\fR\fIreuse-level\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-reuse=reuse-level"
This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  \fIreuse_level\fR can be \fBall\fR,
\&\fBnamed_vars\fR, or \fBnone\fR. \fBall\fR enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, \fBnamed_vars\fR enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and \fBnone\fR disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is \fBall\fR. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime will likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the \*(C+
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.

.IX Item "-ftrapv"
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwrapv"
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front end, as required by the Java language specification.
.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexceptions"
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 enables it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnon-call-exceptions"
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows \fItrapping\fR
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point

arbitrary signal handlers such as \f(CW\*(C`SIGALRM\*(C'\fR.

Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise

.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-unique\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-unique"
On systems with recent \s-1GNU\s0 assembler and C library, the \*(C+ compiler
uses the \f(CW\*(C`STB_GNU_UNIQUE\*(C'\fR binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of \f(CW\*(C`RTLD_LOCAL\*(C'\fR; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
\&\f(CW\*(C`RTLD_LOCAL\*(C'\fR plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes \f(CW\*(C`dlclose\*(C'\fR to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a \s-1DSO\s0 via
\&\f(CW\*(C`dlclose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR, you can use
\&\fB\-fno\-gnu\-unique\fR.

GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

.IP "\fB\-fno\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-common"
In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by \fB\-fcommon\fR, and is the default
for \s-1GCC\s0 on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by \s-1ISO C,\s0 and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The \fB\-fno\-common\fR option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR) in two different compilations,
you get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with \fB\-fcommon\fR instead.
Compiling with \fB\-fno\-common\fR is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.

Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while

extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
.IP "\fB\-frecord\-gcc\-switches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frecord-gcc-switches"
This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing \s-1ASCII\s0 text.  This
switch is related to the \fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also \fB\-grecord\-gcc\-switches\fR for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
.IP "\fB\-fpic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpic"
Generate position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (\s-1GOT\s0).  The dynamic
loader resolves the \s-1GOT\s0 entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of \s-1GCC\s0; it is part of the operating system).  If
the \s-1GOT\s0 size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
\&\fB\-fpic\fR does not work; in that case, recompile with \fB\-fPIC\fR
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the \s-1SPARC\s0 and 32k
on the m68k and \s-1RS/6000. \s0 The 386 has no such limit.)
.Sp
Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, \s-1GCC\s0 supports \s-1PIC\s0 for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the \s-1IBM RS/6000\s0 is always
position-independent.

Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_return_address\*(C'\fR does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

\&                                       void *call_site);
.Ve
.Sp
The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \fBextern inline\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\*(C'\fR).  If the file that

that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the \fIfile\fR parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.

.IX Item "-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,..."
This is similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list\*(C'\fR,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as \f(CW\*(C`vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)\*(C'\fR, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE\*(C'\fR).  The
match is done on substrings: if the \fIsym\fR parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and \*(C+
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 not
using universal character names.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-check"
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the

a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.
.Sp
You can additionally specify a string parameter: \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR means no
checking, \f(CW\*(C`generic\*(C'\fR means force the use of old-style checking,
\&\f(CW\*(C`specific\*(C'\fR means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare \fB\-fstack\-check\fR.
.Sp
Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.
.IP "2." 4
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is

a warning is issued by the compiler.

Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,

the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

.IX Item "-fsplit-stack"
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only

When code compiled with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR calls code compiled

available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR is not an option,

abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 specification requirements, \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator delete\*(C'\fR must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \fB#pragma \s-1GCC\s0 visibility push(default)\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp
\&\fBextern\fR declarations are not affected by \fB\-fvisibility\fR, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
functions with no explicit visibility use the \s-1PLT,\s0 so it is more
effective to use \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute ((visibility))\*(C'\fR and/or
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility\*(C'\fR to tell the compiler which \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
declarations should be treated as hidden.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fvisibility\fR does affect \*(C+ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the \fBtype_info\fR nodes are unified between
the DSOs.
.Sp
An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\fR>.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-volatile\-bitfields\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-volatile-bitfields"
This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force \s-1GCC\s0 to use 16\-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32\-bit access.
.Sp
If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32\-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.
.Sp
In some cases, such as when the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute is applied to a 
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case \s-1GCC\s0 falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that 
will fault or truncate the result at run time.
.Sp
Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/\*(C+11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field members.
.Sp
The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.
.IP "\fB\-fsync\-libcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsync-libcalls"
This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync\*(C'\fR
family of functions may be used to implement the \*(C+11 \f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic\*(C'\fR
family of functions.
.Sp
The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is \fB\-fno\-sync\-libcalls\fR.  This option is used in
the implementation of the \fIlibatomic\fR runtime library.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information which allows \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
iPK
     ŠcO¨æã¥      	   1/1.z2204nstallation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG"
Setting \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR is nearly equivalent to passing
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 searches
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR just before it searches the standard directory 
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
\&\fIprefix\fR then the value of \fIprefix\fR is replaced by
\&\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR when looking for header files.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`mblen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mbtowc\*(C'\fR as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPATH"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBC_INCLUDE_PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "C_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

On some systems, \fBgcc \-shared\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgcov\fR is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with \s-1GCC\s0
to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running
code and to discover untested parts of your program.  You can use
\&\fBgcov\fR as a profiling tool to help discover where your
optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use
\&\fBgcov\fR along with the other profiling tool, \fBgprof\fR, to
assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing
time.
.PP
Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
profiler such as \fBgcov\fR or \fBgprof\fR, you can find out some
basic performance statistics, such as:
.IP "\(bu" 4
how often each line of code executes
.IP "\(bu" 4
what lines of code are actually executed
.IP "\(bu" 4
how much computing time each section of code uses
.PP
Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you
can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized.
\&\fBgcov\fR helps you determine where to work on optimization.
.PP
Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release.
Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
final product.
.PP
You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
\&\fBgcov\fR because the optimization, by combining some lines of code
into one function, may not give you as much information as you need to
look for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer
time.  Likewise, because \fBgcov\fR accumulates statistics by line (at
the lowest resolution), it works best with a programming style that
places only one statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros

\&\fBgcov\fR creates a logfile called \fI\fIsourcefile\fI.gcov\fR which
indicates how many times each line of a source file \fI\fIsourcefile\fI.c\fR
has executed.  You can use these logfiles along with \fBgprof\fR to aid
in fine-tuning the performance of your programs.  \fBgprof\fR gives
timing information you can use along with the information you get from
\&\fBgcov\fR.
.PP
\&\fBgcov\fR works only on code compiled with \s-1GCC. \s0 It is not
compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

\&\fBgcov\fR should be run with the current directory the same as that
when you invoked the compiler.  Otherwise it will not be able to locate
the source files.  \fBgcov\fR produces files called
\&\fI\fImangledname\fI.gcov\fR in the current directory.  These contain
the coverage information of the source file they correspond to.
One \fI.gcov\fR file is produced for each source (or header) file
containing code,
which was compiled to produce the data files.  The \fImangledname\fR part
of the output file name is usually simply the source file name, but can
be something more complicated if the \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-p\fR options are
given.  Refer to those options for details.
.PP
If you invoke \fBgcov\fR with multiple input files, the
contributions from each input file are summed.  Typically you would
invoke it with the same list of files as the final link of your executable.
.PP
The \fI.gcov\fR files contain the \fB:\fR separated fields along with
program source code.  The format is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <execution_count>:<line_number>:<source line text>
.Ve
.PP
Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option.  The \fIexecution_count\fR is \fB\-\fR for lines
containing no code.  Unexecuted lines are marked \fB#####\fR or
\&\fB====\fR, depending on whether they are reachable by
non-exceptional paths or only exceptional paths such as \*(C+ exception
handlers, respectively.
.PP
Some lines of information at the start have \fIline_number\fR of zero.

The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented as
\&\fBgcov\fR development progresses \-\-\- do not rely on them remaining

When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values

nearest non-boundary value.
.PP
When using \fBgcov\fR, you must first compile your program with two
special \s-1GCC\s0 options: \fB\-fprofile\-arcs \-ftest\-coverage\fR.
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the object file is located.
.PP
Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, an accompanying
\&\fI.gcda\fR file will be placed in the object file directory.
.PP
Running \fBgcov\fR with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called \fItmp.c\fR, this
is what you see when you use the basic \fBgcov\fR facility:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        $ gcc \-fprofile\-arcs \-ftest\-coverage tmp.c
\&        $ a.out
\&        $ gcov tmp.c
\&        90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
\&        Creating tmp.c.gcov.

The file \fItmp.c.gcov\fR contains output from \fBgcov\fR.

For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the function
is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
function's blocks were executed.
.PP
For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.
.PP
For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message \*(L"never executed\*(R" is printed.
.PP
For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions that call \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR,
and thus may not return every time they are called.
.PP
The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the \fI.gcda\fR file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.
.PP
The data in the \fI.gcda\fR files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with \fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR, the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing \fI.gcda\fR file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.
.SS "Using \fBgcov\fP with \s-1GCC\s0 Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Using gcov with GCC Optimization"
If you plan to use \fBgcov\fR to help optimize your code, you must
first compile your program with two special \s-1GCC\s0 options:
\&\fB\-fprofile\-arcs \-ftest\-coverage\fR.  Aside from that, you can use any
other \s-1GCC\s0 options; but if you want to prove that every single line
in your program was executed, you should not compile with optimization
at the same time.  On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some
simple code lines by combining them with other lines.  For example, code
like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        if (a != b)
\&          c = 1;
\&        else
\&          c = 0;
.Ve
.PP
can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
there is no way for \fBgcov\fR to calculate separate execution counts
for each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence
the \fBgcov\fR output looks like this if you compiled the program with
optimization:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&              100:   12:if (a != b)
\&              100:   13:  c = 1;
\&              100:   14:else
\&              100:   15:  c = 0;
.Ve
.PP
The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
many times the result was 1.
.PP
Inlineable functions can create unexpected line counts.  Line counts are
shown for the source code of the inlineable function, but what is shown
depends on where the function is inlined, or if it is not inlined at all.
.PP
If the function is not inlined, the compiler must emit an out of line
copy of the function, in any object file that needs it.  If
\&\fIfileA.o\fR and \fIfileB.o\fR both contain out of line bodies of a
particular inlineable function, they will also both contain coverage
counts for that function.  When \fIfileA.o\fR and \fIfileB.o\fR are
linked together, the linker will, on many systems, select one of those
out of line bodies for all calls to that function, and remove or ignore
the other.  Unfortunately, it will not remove the coverage counters for
the unused function body.  Hence when instrumented, all but one use of
that function will show zero counts.
.PP
If the function is inlined in several places, the block structure in
each location might not be the same.  For instance, a condition might
now be calculable at compile time in some instances.  Because the
coverage of all the uses of the inline function will be shown for the
same source lines, the line counts themselves might seem inconsistent.
.PP
Long-running applications can use the \f(CW\*(C`_gcov_reset\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_gcov_dump\*(C'\fR
facilities to restrict profile collection to the program region of
interest. Calling \f(CW\*(C`_gcov_reset(void)\*(C'\fR will clear all profile counters
to zero, and calling \f(CW\*(C`_gcov_dump(void)\*(C'\fR will cause the profile information
collected at that point to be dumped to \fI.gcda\fR output files.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The purpose of a debugger such as \s-1GDB\s0 is to allow you to see what is
going on \*(L"inside\*(R" another program while it executes \*(-- or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.
.PP
\&\s-1GDB\s0 can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Make your program stop on specified conditions.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
.PP
You can use \s-1GDB\s0 to debug programs written in C, C@t{++}, Fortran and
Modula\-2.
.PP
\&\s-1GDB\s0 is invoked with the shell command \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR.  Once started, it reads
commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with the \s-1GDB\s0
command \f(CW\*(C`quit\*(C'\fR.  You can get online help from \s-1GDB\s0 itself
by using the command \f(CW\*(C`help\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can run \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR with no arguments or options; but the most
usual way to start \s-1GDB\s0 is with one argument or two, specifying an
executable program as the argument:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gdb program
.Ve
.PP
You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gdb program core
.Ve
.PP
You can, instead, specify a process \s-1ID\s0 as a second argument, if you want
to debug a running process:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        gdb program 1234
\&        gdb \-p 1234
.Ve
.PP
would attach \s-1GDB\s0 to process \f(CW1234\fR (unless you also have a file
named \fI1234\fR; \s-1GDB\s0 does check for a core file first).
With option \fB\-p\fR you can omit the \fIprogram\fR filename.
.PP
Here are some of the most frequently needed \s-1GDB\s0 commands:
.IP "\fBbreak [\fR\fIfile\fR\fB:]\fR\fIfunctiop\fR" 4
.IX Item "break [file:]functiop"
Set a breakpoint at \fIfunction\fR (in \fIfile\fR).
.IP "\fBrun [\fR\fIarglist\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "run [arglist]"
Start your program (with \fIarglist\fR, if specified).
.IP "\fBbt\fR" 4
.IX Item "bt"
Backtrace: display the program stack.
.IP "\fBprint\fR \fIexpr\fR" 4
.IX Item "print expr"
Display the value of an expression.
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).
.IP "\fBnext\fR" 4
.IX Item "next"
Execute next program line (after stopping); step \fIover\fR any
function calls in the line.
.IP "\fBedit [\fR\fIfile\fR\fB:]\fR\fIfunction\fR" 4
.IX Item "edit [file:]function"
look at the program line where it is presently stopped.
.IP "\fBlist [\fR\fIfile\fR\fB:]\fR\fIfunction\fR" 4
.IX Item "list [file:]function"
type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is presently stopped.
.IP "\fBstep\fR" 4
.IX Item "step"
Execute next program line (after stopping); step \fIinto\fR any
function calls in the line.
.IP "\fBhelp [\fR\fIname\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "help [name]"
Show information about \s-1GDB\s0 command \fIname\fR, or general information
about using \s-1GDB.\s0
.IP "\fBquit\fR" 4
.IX Item "quit"
Exit from \s-1GDB.\s0
.PP
For full details on \s-1GDB,\s0
see \fIUsing \s-1GDB: A\s0 Guide to the \s-1GNU\s0 Source-Level Debugger\fR,
by Richard M. Stallman and Roland H. Pesch.  The same text is available online
as the \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR entry in the \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR program.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Any arguments other than options specify an executable
file and core file (or process \s-1ID\s0); that is, the first argument
encountered with no
associated option flag is equivalent to a \fB\-se\fR option, and the second,
if any, is equivalent to a \fB\-c\fR option if it's the name of a file.
Many options have
both long and short forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are also
recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option is
present to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you can flag option
arguments with \fB+\fR rather than \fB\-\fR, though we illustrate the
more usual convention.)
.PP
All the options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the \fB\-x\fR
option is used.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
.PD
List all options, with brief explanations.
.IP "\fB\-symbols=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbols=file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-s\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s file"
.PD
Read symbol table from file \fIfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-write\fR" 4
.IX Item "-write"
Enable writing into executable and core files.
.IP "\fB\-exec=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-exec=file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e file"
.PD
Use file \fIfile\fR as the executable file to execute when
appropriate, and for examining pure data in conjunction with a core
dump.
.IP "\fB\-se=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-se=file"
Read symbol table from file \fIfile\fR and use it as the executable
file.
.IP "\fB\-core=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-core=file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c file"
.PD

.IP "\fB\-command=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-command=file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-x\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x file"
.PD
Execute \s-1GDB\s0 commands from file \fIfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ex\fR \fIcommand\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ex command"
Execute given \s-1GDB \s0\fIcommand\fR.
.IP "\fB\-directory=\fR\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-directory=directory"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d directory"
.PD
Add \fIdirectory\fR to the path to search for source files.
.IP "\fB\-nh\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nh"
Do not execute commands from \fI~/.gdbinit\fR.
.IP "\fB\-nx\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nx"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n"
.PD
Do not execute commands from any \fI.gdbinit\fR initialization files.
.IP "\fB\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-quiet"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q"
.PD
\&\*(L"Quiet\*(R".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These
messages are also suppressed in batch mode.
.IP "\fB\-batch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-batch"
Run in batch mode.  Exit with status \f(CW0\fR after processing all the command
files specified with \fB\-x\fR (and \fI.gdbinit\fR, if not inhibited).
Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the \s-1GDB\s0
commands in the command files.
.Sp
Batch mode may be useful for running \s-1GDB\s0 as a filter, for example to
download and run a program on another computer; in order to make this
more useful, the message
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Program exited normally.
.Ve
.Sp
(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under \s-1GDB\s0 control
terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.
.IP "\fB\-cd=\fR\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cd=directory"
Run \s-1GDB\s0 using \fIdirectory\fR as its working directory,
instead of the current directory.
.IP "\fB\-fullname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fullname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD
Emacs sets this option when it runs \s-1GDB\s0 as a subprocess.  It tells
\&\s-1GDB\s0 to output the full file name and line number in a standard,
recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed (which
includes each time the program stops).  This recognizable format looks
like two \fB\e032\fR characters, followed by the file name, line number
and character position separated by colons, and a newline.  The
Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two \fB\e032\fR
characters as a signal to display the source code for the frame.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIbps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b bps"
Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial
interface used by \s-1GDB\s0 for remote debugging.
.IP "\fB\-tty=\fR\fIdevice\fR" 4
.IX Item "-tty=device"
Run using \fIdevice\fR for your program's standard input and output.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
The full documentation for \s-1GDB\s0 is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR programs and \s-1GDB\s0's Texinfo
documentation are properly installed at your site, the command
.PP

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgdbserver\fR is a program that allows you to run \s-1GDB\s0 on a different machine
than the one which is running the program being debugged.
.PP
Usage (server (target) side):
.PP
First, you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug put onto
the target system.  The program can be stripped to save space if needed, as
\&\fBgdbserver\fR doesn't care about symbols.  All symbol handling is taken care of by
the \s-1GDB\s0 running on the host system.
.PP
To use the server, you log on to the target system, and run the \fBgdbserver\fR
program.  You must tell it (a) how to communicate with \s-1GDB, \s0(b) the name of
your program, and (c) its arguments.  The general syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver <comm> <program> [<args> ...]
.Ve
.PP
For example, using a serial port, you might say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt
.Ve
.PP
This tells \fBgdbserver\fR to debug emacs with an argument of foo.txt, and
to communicate with \s-1GDB\s0 via \fI/dev/com1\fR.  \fBgdbserver\fR now
waits patiently for the host \s-1GDB\s0 to communicate with it.
.PP
To use a \s-1TCP\s0 connection, you could say:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
.Ve
.PP
This says pretty much the same thing as the last example, except that we are
going to communicate with the \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR \s-1GDB\s0 via \s-1TCP. \s0 The \f(CW\*(C`host:2345\*(C'\fR argument means
that we are expecting to see a \s-1TCP\s0 connection from \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR to local \s-1TCP\s0 port
2345.  (Currently, the \f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR part is ignored.)  You can choose any number you
want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any existing \s-1TCP\s0
ports on the target system.  This same port number must be used in the host
GDBs \f(CW\*(C`target remote\*(C'\fR command, which will be described shortly.  Note that if
you chose a port number that conflicts with another service, \fBgdbserver\fR will
print an error message and exit.
.PP
\&\fBgdbserver\fR can also attach to running programs.
This is accomplished via the \fB\-\-attach\fR argument.  The syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver \-\-attach <comm> <pid>
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIpid\fR is the process \s-1ID\s0 of a currently running process.  It isn't
necessary to point \fBgdbserver\fR at a binary for the running process.
.PP
To start \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR without supplying an initial command to run
or process \s-1ID\s0 to attach, use the \fB\-\-multi\fR command line option.
In such case you should connect using \f(CW\*(C`target extended\-remote\*(C'\fR to start
the program you want to debug.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver \-\-multi <comm>
.Ve
.PP
Usage (host side):
.PP
You need an unstripped copy of the target program on your host system, since
\&\s-1GDB\s0 needs to examine it's symbol tables and such.  Start up \s-1GDB\s0 as you normally
would, with the target program as the first argument.  (You may need to use the
\&\fB\-\-baud\fR option if the serial line is running at anything except 9600 baud.)
That is \f(CW\*(C`gdb TARGET\-PROG\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`gdb \-\-baud BAUD TARGET\-PROG\*(C'\fR.  After that, the only
new command you need to know about is \f(CW\*(C`target remote\*(C'\fR
(or \f(CW\*(C`target extended\-remote\*(C'\fR).  Its argument is either
a device name (usually a serial device, like \fI/dev/ttyb\fR), or a \f(CW\*(C`HOST:PORT\*(C'\fR
descriptor.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyb
.Ve
.PP
communicates with the server via serial line \fI/dev/ttyb\fR, and:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        (gdb) target remote the\-target:2345
.Ve
.PP
communicates via a \s-1TCP\s0 connection to port 2345 on host `the\-target', where
you previously started up \fBgdbserver\fR with the same port number.  Note that for
\&\s-1TCP\s0 connections, you must start up \fBgdbserver\fR prior to using the `target remote'
command, otherwise you may get an error that looks something like
`Connection refused'.
.PP
\&\fBgdbserver\fR can also debug multiple inferiors at once,
described in
the \s-1GDB\s0 manual in node \f(CW\*(C`Inferiors and Programs\*(C'\fR
\&\*(-- shell command \f(CW\*(C`info \-f gdb \-n \*(AqInferiors and Programs\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
In such case use the \f(CW\*(C`extended\-remote\*(C'\fR \s-1GDB\s0 command variant:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        (gdb) target extended\-remote the\-target:2345
.Ve
.PP
The \fBgdbserver\fR option \fB\-\-multi\fR may or may not be used in such
case.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
There are three different modes for invoking \fBgdbserver\fR:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Debug a specific program specified by its program name:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gdbserver <comm> <prog> [<args>...]
.Ve
.Sp
The \fIcomm\fR parameter specifies how should the server communicate
with \s-1GDB\s0; it is either a device name (to use a serial line),
a \s-1TCP\s0 port number (\f(CW\*(C`:1234\*(C'\fR), or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`stdio\*(C'\fR to use
stdin/stdout of \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR.  Specify the name of the program to
debug in \fIprog\fR.  Any remaining arguments will be passed to the
program verbatim.  When the program exits, \s-1GDB\s0 will close the
connection, and \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR will exit.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Debug a specific program by specifying the process \s-1ID\s0 of a running
program:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gdbserver \-\-attach <comm> <pid>
.Ve
.Sp
The \fIcomm\fR parameter is as described above.  Supply the process \s-1ID\s0
of a running program in \fIpid\fR; \s-1GDB\s0 will do everything
else.  Like with the previous mode, when the process \fIpid\fR exits,
\&\s-1GDB\s0 will close the connection, and \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR will exit.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Multi-process mode \*(-- debug more than one program/process:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gdbserver \-\-multi <comm>
.Ve
.Sp
In this mode, \s-1GDB\s0 can instruct \fBgdbserver\fR which
command(s) to run.  Unlike the other 2 modes, \s-1GDB\s0 will not
close the connection when a process being debugged exits, so you can
debug several processes in the same session.
.PP
In each of the modes you may specify these options:
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
List all options, with brief explanations.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
This option causes \fBgdbserver\fR to print its version number and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-attach\fR" 4
.IX Item "--attach"
\&\fBgdbserver\fR will attach to a running program.  The syntax is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver \-\-attach <comm> <pid>
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fIpid\fR is the process \s-1ID\s0 of a currently running process.  It isn't
necessary to point \fBgdbserver\fR at a binary for the running process.
.IP "\fB\-\-multi\fR" 4
.IX Item "--multi"
To start \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR without supplying an initial command to run
or process \s-1ID\s0 to attach, use this command line option.
Then you can connect using \f(CW\*(C`target extended\-remote\*(C'\fR and start
the program you want to debug.  The syntax is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        target> gdbserver \-\-multi <comm>
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debug"
Instruct \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR to display extra status information about the debugging
process.
This option is intended for \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR development and for bug reports to
the developers.
.IP "\fB\-\-remote\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "--remote-debug"
Instruct \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR to display remote protocol debug output.
This option is intended for \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR development and for bug reports to
the developers.
.IP "\fB\-\-debug\-format=option1\fR[\fB,option2,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--debug-format=option1[,option2,...]"
Instruct \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR to include extra information in each line
of debugging output.
.IP "\fB\-\-wrapper\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wrapper"
Specify a wrapper to launch programs
for debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the
wrapper, then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.
.IP "\fB\-\-once\fR" 4
.IX Item "--once"
By default, \fBgdbserver\fR keeps the listening \s-1TCP\s0 port open, so that
additional connections are possible.  However, if you start \f(CW\*(C`gdbserver\*(C'\fR
with the \fB\-\-once\fR option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first \s-1GDB\s0 session.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IX Header "SEE ALSO"
The full documentation for \s-1GDB\s0 is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR programs and \s-1GDB\s0's Texinfo
documentation are properly installed at your site, the command
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        info gdb
.Ve
.PP
should give you access to the complete manual.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR produces an execution profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77 
programs.  The effect of called routines is incorporated in the profile 
of each caller.  The profile data is taken from the call graph profile file
(\fIgmon.out\fR default) which is created by programs
that are compiled with the \fB\-pg\fR option of
\&\f(CW\*(C`cc\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pc\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`f77\*(C'\fR.
The \fB\-pg\fR option also links in versions of the library routines
that are compiled for profiling.  \f(CW\*(C`Gprof\*(C'\fR reads the given object 
file (the default is \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR) and establishes the relation between
its symbol table and the call graph profile from \fIgmon.out\fR.
If more than one profile file is specified, the \f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR
output shows the sum of the profile information in the given profile files.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Gprof\*(C'\fR calculates the amount of time spent in each routine.
Next, these times are propagated along the edges of the call graph.
Cycles are discovered, and calls into a cycle are made to share the time
of the cycle.
.PP
Several forms of output are available from the analysis.
.PP
The \fIflat profile\fR shows how much time your program spent in each function,
and how many times that function was called.  If you simply want to know
which functions burn most of the cycles, it is stated concisely here.
.PP
The \fIcall graph\fR shows, for each function, which functions called it, which
other functions it called, and how many times.  There is also an estimate
of how much time was spent in the subroutines of each function.  This can
suggest places where you might try to eliminate function calls that use a
lot of time.
.PP
The \fIannotated source\fR listing is a copy of the program's
source code, labeled with the number of times each line of the
program was executed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
These options specify which of several output formats
\&\f(CW\*(C`gprof\*(C'\fR should produce.
.PP
Many of these options take an optional \fIsymspec\fR to specify
functions to be included or excluded.  These options can be
specified multiple times, with different symspecs, to include
or exclude sets of symbols.
.PP
Specifying any of these options overrides the default (\fB\-p \-q\fR),
which prints a flat profile and call graph analysis
for all functions.

The granularity of the sampling is shown, but remains
statistical at best.
We assume that the time for each execution of a function
can be expressed by the total time for the function divided
by the number of times the function is called.
Thus the time propagated along the call graph arcs to the function's
parents is directly proportional to the number of times that
arc is traversed.
.PP
Parents that are not themselves profiled will have the time of
their profiled children propagated to them, but they will appear
to be spontaneously invoked in the call graph listing, and will
not have their time propagated further.
Similarly, signal catchers, even though profiled, will appear
to be spontaneous (although for more obscure reasons).
Any profiled children of signal catchers should have their times
propagated properly, unless the signal catcher was invoked during
the execution of the profiling routine, in which case all is lost.
.PP
The profiled program must call \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR(2)
or return normally for the profiling information to be saved
in the \fIgmon.out\fR file.

.SH "NAME"
ld \- The GNU linker
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ld [\fBoptions\fR] \fIobjfile\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBld\fR combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run \fBld\fR.
.PP
\&\fBld\fR accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of \s-1AT&T\s0's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.
.PP
This man page does not describe the command language; see the
\&\fBld\fR entry in \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR for full details on the command
language and on other aspects of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.
.PP
This version of \fBld\fR uses the general purpose \s-1BFD\s0 libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \fBld\fR to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats\-\-\-for example, \s-1COFF\s0 or
\&\f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.
.PP
Aside from its flexibility, the \s-1GNU\s0 linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
\&\fBld\fR continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker \fBld\fR is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result,
you have many choices to control its behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \fBld\fR is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ld \-o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o \-lc
.Ve
.PP
This tells \fBld\fR to produce a file called \fIoutput\fR as the
result of linking the file \f(CW\*(C`/lib/crt0.o\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR and
the library \f(CW\*(C`libc.a\*(C'\fR, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the \fB\-l\fR option below.)
.PP
Some of the command-line options to \fBld\fR may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-T\fR, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
.PP
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
.PP
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-R\fR,
and the script command language.  If \fIno\fR binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message \fBNo input files\fR.
.PP
If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using \fB\-T\fR).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR to load other objects.  Specifying a
script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the
extra commands placed after the main script; use the \fB\-T\fR option
to replace the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of
the \f(CW\*(C`INSERT\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
.PP
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, \fB\-trace\-symbol\fR and
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol\fR are equivalent.  Note\-\-\-there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
\&\fB\-o\fR option.  So for example \fB\-omagic\fR sets the output file
name to \fBmagic\fR whereas \fB\-\-omagic\fR sets the \s-1NMAGIC\s0 flag on the
output.
.PP
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol foo\fR and \fB\-\-trace\-symbol=foo\fR are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
.PP
Note\-\-\-if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. \fBgcc\fR) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by \fB\-Wl,\fR (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc \-Wl,\-\-start\-group foo.o bar.o \-Wl,\-\-end\-group
.Ve
.PP
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.  Confusion
may also arise when passing options that require values through a
driver, as the use of a space between option and argument acts as
a separator, and causes the driver to pass only the option to the linker
and the argument to the compiler.  In this case, it is simplest to use
the joined forms of both single\- and multiple-letter options, such as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc foo.o bar.o \-Wl,\-eENTRY \-Wl,\-Map=a.map
.Ve
.PP
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the \s-1GNU\s0
linker:
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIkeyword\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a keyword"
This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The \fIkeyword\fR
argument must be one of the strings \fBarchive\fR, \fBshared\fR, or
\&\fBdefault\fR.  \fB\-aarchive\fR is functionally equivalent to
\&\fB\-Bstatic\fR, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to \fB\-Bdynamic\fR.  This option may be used any number of times.
.IP "\fB\-\-audit\fR \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--audit AUDITLIB"
Adds \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`DT_AUDIT\*(C'\fR entry of the dynamic section.
\&\fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR is not checked for existence, nor will it use the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
specified in the library.  If specified multiple times \f(CW\*(C`DT_AUDIT\*(C'\fR
will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker
finds an object with an audit entry while searching for shared libraries,
it will add a corresponding \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C'\fR entry in the output file.
This option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms supporting the rtld-audit
interface.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR \fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A architecture"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-architecture=\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=architecture"
.PD
In the current release of \fBld\fR, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \fBld\fR configuration, the
\&\fIarchitecture\fR argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.
.Sp
Future releases of \fBld\fR may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b input-format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=input-format"
.PD
\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-b\fR option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when \fBld\fR is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as \fBld\fR should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
\&\fIinput-format\fR is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)
.Sp
You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use \fB\-b\fR to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
\&\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR before each group of object files in a
particular format.
.Sp
The default format is taken from the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR;
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c MRI-commandfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mri\-script=\fR\fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mri-script=MRI-commandfile"
.PD
For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI\s0, \fBld\fR accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation.
Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with
the option \fB\-c\fR; use the \fB\-T\fR option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose \fBld\fR scripting language.
If \fIMRI-cmdfile\fR does not exist, \fBld\fR looks for it in the directories
specified by any \fB\-L\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-dc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dc"
.IP "\fB\-dp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dp"
.PD
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with \fB\-r\fR).  The
script command \f(CW\*(C`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.IP "\fB\-\-depaudit\fR \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--depaudit AUDITLIB"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P AUDITLIB"
.PD
Adds \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C'\fR entry of the dynamic section.
\&\fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR is not checked for existence, nor will it use the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
specified in the library.  If specified multiple times \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C'\fR
will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use.  This
option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface.
The \-P option is provided for Solaris compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e entry"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-entry=\fR\fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "--entry=entry"
.PD
Use \fIentry\fR as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named \fIentry\fR, the linker will try to parse \fIentry\fR as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading \fB0x\fR for base 16, or a leading
\&\fB0\fR for base 8).
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-libs\fR \fIlib\fR\fB,\fR\fIlib\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-libs lib,lib,..."
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically
exported.  The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\-libs ALL\*(C'\fR excludes symbols in all archive libraries from
automatic export.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted
port of the linker and for \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  For i386 \s-1PE\s0, symbols
explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this
option.  For \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports, symbols affected by this option will
be treated as hidden.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-modules\-for\-implib\fR \fImodule\fR\fB,\fR\fImodule\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-modules-for-implib module,module,..."
Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols
should not be automatically exported, but which should be copied wholesale
into the import library being generated during the link.  The module names
may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the filenames
used by \fBld\fR to open the files; for archive members, this is simply
the member name, but for object files the name listed must include and
match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the linker's
command-line.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port
of the linker.  Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported,
regardless of this option.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-dynamic"
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-export-dynamic"
.PD
When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the \fB\-E\fR
option or the \fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR option causes the linker to add
all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the
set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
.Sp
If you do not use either of these options (or use the
\&\fB\-\-no\-export\-dynamic\fR option to restore the default behavior), the
dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols which are
referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.
.Sp
If you use \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
.Sp
You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of \fB\-\-dynamic\-list\fR.
.Sp
Note that this option is specific to \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  \s-1PE\s0 targets
support a similar function to export all symbols from a \s-1DLL\s0 or \s-1EXE\s0; see
the description of \fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR below.
.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-auxiliary=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auxiliary=name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object

in the filter object.  The shared object \fIname\fR need not exist.
Thus the shared object \fIname\fR may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.

.IX Item "--filter=name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object \fIname\fR.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
\&\fIname\fR.
.Sp
Some older linkers used the \fB\-F\fR option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR, \fB\-\-oformat\fR options, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR command in linker scripts, and the \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR
environment variable.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the \fB\-F\fR option when not
creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.

When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the

the function to call.

When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object

When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the

.PD
Add the archive or object file specified by \fInamespec\fR to the
list of files to link.  This option may be used any number of times.
If \fInamespec\fR is of the form \fI:\fIfilename\fI\fR, \fBld\fR
will search the library path for a file called \fIfilename\fR, otherwise it
will search the library path for a file called \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.
.Sp
On systems which support shared libraries, \fBld\fR may also search for
files other than \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0
and SunOS systems, \fBld\fR will search a directory for a library
called \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.so\fR before searching for one called
\&\fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.  (By convention, a \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR extension
indicates a shared library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply
to \fI:\fIfilename\fI\fR, which always specifies a file called
\&\fIfilename\fR.
.Sp
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
.Sp
See the \fB\-(\fR option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
.Sp
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
.Sp
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using \fBld\fR on \s-1AIX\s0, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.

Add path \fIsearchdir\fR to the list of paths that \fBld\fR will search
for archive libraries and \fBld\fR control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
\&\fB\-L\fR options apply to all \fB\-l\fR options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.  \fB\-L\fR options do not affect
how \fBld\fR searches for a linker script unless \fB\-T\fR
option is specified.
.Sp
If \fIsearchdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the \fIsysroot prefix\fR, a path specified when the linker is configured.
.Sp
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR) depends on which emulation mode \fBld\fR is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.
.Sp
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEARCH_DIR\*(C'\fR command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.

If the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, the emulation is taken from the

Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.

Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides

.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Where object files are mapped into memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
How common symbols are allocated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol

.IP "\(bu" 4
The values assigned to symbols.
.Sp
Note \- symbols whose values are computed by an expression which
involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not
have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is because the
linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value
of an expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display
the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus for example a
linker script containing:
.Sp
.Vb 3

\&           foo = foo * 4
\&           foo = foo + 8

Asks the linker \fInot\fR to check section addresses after they have
been assigned to see if there are any overlaps.  Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make
allowances for sections in overlays.  The default behaviour can be
restored by using the command line switch \fB\-\-check\-sections\fR.
Section overlap is not usually checked for relocatable links.  You can

.PD
This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries referred to
by \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tags \fIinside\fR \s-1ELF\s0 dynamic libraries mentioned on the
command line.  Normally the linker won't add a \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tag to the
output binary for each library mentioned in a \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tag in an
input dynamic library.  With \fB\-\-copy\-dt\-needed\-entries\fR
specified on the command line however any dynamic libraries that
follow it will have their \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 entries added.  The default
behaviour can be restored with \fB\-\-no\-copy\-dt\-needed\-entries\fR.
.Sp
This option also has an effect on the resolution of symbols in dynamic
libraries.  With \fB\-\-copy\-dt\-needed\-entries\fR dynamic libraries
mentioned on the command line will be recursively searched, following
their \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tags to other libraries, in order to resolve symbols
required by the output binary.  With the default setting however
the searching of dynamic libraries that follow it will stop with the
dynamic library itself.  No \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 links will be traversed to resolve
symbols.

.IX Item "--cref"
Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being
generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file.
Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
.Sp
The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  If the symbol is defined as a common value then any files
where this happens appear next.  Finally any files that reference the
symbol are listed.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-define-common"
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols.
The script command \f(CW\*(C`INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.
.IP "\fB\-\-defsym=\fR\fIsymbol\fR\fB=\fR\fIexpression\fR" 4
.IX Item "--defsym=symbol=expression"
Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute
address given by \fIexpression\fR.  You may use this option as many
times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
limited form of arithmetic is supported for the \fIexpression\fR in this
context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
symbol, or use \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to add or subtract hexadecimal
constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider
using the linker command language from a script.  \fINote:\fR there should be no white

.PD
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages
and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts \*(C+
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable \fB\s-1COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\s0\fR

If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a

the output file to one of the same name with a \f(CW\*(C`.exe\*(C'\fR suffix. This
option is useful when using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft
Windows host, since some versions of Windows won't run an image unless

performing this garbage collection) can be restored by specifying
\&\fB\-\-no\-gc\-sections\fR on the command line.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-gc\-sections\fR decides which input sections are used by
examining symbols and relocations.  The section containing the entry
symbol and all sections containing symbols undefined on the
command-line will be kept, as will sections containing symbols
referenced by dynamic objects.  Note that when building shared
libraries, the linker must assume that any visible symbol is
referenced.  Once this initial set of sections has been determined,
the linker recursively marks as used any section referenced by their
relocations.  See \fB\-\-entry\fR and \fB\-\-undefined\fR.
.Sp
This option can be set when doing a partial link (enabled with option
\&\fB\-r\fR).  In this case the root of symbols kept must be explicitly

Allows or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries.
This switch is similar to \fB\-\-no\-undefined\fR except that it
determines the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in a
shared library rather than a regular object file.  It does not affect
how undefined symbols in regular object files are handled.
.Sp
The default behaviour is to report errors for any undefined symbols
referenced in shared libraries if the linker is being used to create
an executable, but to allow them if the linker is being used to create
a shared library.
.Sp
The reasons for allowing undefined symbol references in shared
libraries specified at link time are that:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
A shared library specified at link time may not be the same as the one
that is available at load time, so the symbol might actually be
resolvable at load time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There are some operating systems, eg BeOS and \s-1HPPA\s0, where undefined
symbols in shared libraries are normal.

The BeOS kernel for example patches shared libraries at load time to
select whichever function is most appropriate for the current
architecture.  This is used, for example, to dynamically select an
appropriate memset function.

On some platforms the \fB\-\-relax\fR option performs target specific,
global optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves
addressing in the program, such as relaxing address modes,
synthesizing new instructions, selecting shorter version of current

.IX Item "-rpath=dir"
Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
linking an \s-1ELF\s0 executable with shared objects.  All \fB\-rpath\fR
arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The \fB\-rpath\fR option is
also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option.  If \fB\-rpath\fR is not used when linking an
\&\s-1ELF\s0 executable, the contents of the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`LD_RUN_PATH\*(C'\fR will be used if it is defined.
.Sp
The \fB\-rpath\fR option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on
SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the
\&\fB\-L\fR options it is given.  If a \fB\-rpath\fR option is used, the
runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the \fB\-rpath\fR
options, ignoring the \fB\-L\fR options.  This can be useful when using
gcc, which adds many \fB\-L\fR options which may be on \s-1NFS\s0 mounted
file systems.
.Sp
For compatibility with other \s-1ELF\s0 linkers, if the \fB\-R\fR option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the \fB\-rpath\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-rpath\-link=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4

When using \s-1ELF\s0 or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an \f(CW\*(C`ld \-shared\*(C'\fR link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.
.Sp
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.
.Sp
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the
runtime linker would do.

libraries:
.RS 4

Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options.  The difference
between \fB\-rpath\fR and \fB\-rpath\-link\fR is that directories
specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option is only effective
at link time. Searching \fB\-rpath\fR in this way is only supported
by native linkers and cross linkers which have been configured with

certain real time kernels with the \s-1COFF\s0 object file format; since \s-1COFF\s0
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains
more than \fIcount\fR relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.  \fIcount\fR defaults to a value of 32768.

.IP "\fB\-\-traditional\-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "--traditional-format"
For some targets, the output of \fBld\fR is different in some ways from
the output of some existing linker.  This switch requests \fBld\fR to
use the traditional format instead.
.Sp
For example, on SunOS, \fBld\fR combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
\&\f(CW\*(C`dbx\*(C'\fR program can not read the resulting program (\f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR has no
trouble).  The \fB\-\-traditional\-format\fR switch tells \fBld\fR to not
combine duplicate entries.

for compatibility with other linkers, you may omit the leading

is only fully supported on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms which support shared libraries;
see \fB\s-1VERSION\s0\fR.  It is partially supported on \s-1PE\s0 platforms, which can
use version scripts to filter symbol visibility in auto-export mode: any
symbols marked \fBlocal\fR in the version script will not be exported.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-common"
Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,
but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.
.Sp
There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBint i = 1;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i = 1;"
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.
.IP "\fBextern int i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "extern int i;"
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
.IP "\fBint i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i;"
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The \fB\-\-warn\-common\fR option can produce five kinds of warnings.
Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol
just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol
encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be
a common symbol.
.IP "1." 4
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a
definition for the symbol.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        <file>(<section>): warning: common of \`<symbol>\*(Aq
\&           overridden by definition
\&        <file>(<section>): warning: defined here
.Ve
.IP "2." 4
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because a later definition for
the symbol is encountered.  This is the same as the previous case,
except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.
.Sp
.Vb 3

.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-constructors"
Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few
object file formats.  For formats like \s-1COFF\s0 or \s-1ELF\s0, the linker can not
detect the use of global constructors.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-multiple\-gp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-multiple-gp"
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-once\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-once"
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-section\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-section-align"
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
is, if the \f(CW\*(C`SECTIONS\*(C'\fR command does not specify a start address for
the section.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-shared\-textrel\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-shared-textrel"
Warn if the linker adds a \s-1DT_TEXTREL\s0 to a shared object.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-alternate\-em\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-alternate-em"
Warn if an object has alternate \s-1ELF\s0 machine code.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-unresolved\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-unresolved-symbols"
If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option
\&\fB\-\-unresolved\-symbols\fR) it will normally generate an error.
This option makes it generate a warning instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-error\-unresolved\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "--error-unresolved-symbols"
This restores the linker's default behaviour of generating errors when
it is reporting unresolved symbols.
.IP "\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--whole-archive"
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
\&\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
.Sp
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use \fB\-Wl,\-whole\-archive\fR.
Second, don't forget to use \fB\-Wl,\-no\-whole\-archive\fR after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
.IP "\fB\-\-wrap=\fR\fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wrap=symbol"
Use a wrapper function for \fIsymbol\fR.  Any undefined reference to
\&\fIsymbol\fR will be resolved to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  Any
undefined reference to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR will be resolved to
\&\fIsymbol\fR.
.Sp
This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Here is a trivial example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        void *
\&        _\|_wrap_malloc (size_t c)
\&        {
\&          printf ("malloc called with %zu\en", c);
\&          return _\|_real_malloc (c);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If you link other code with this file using \fB\-\-wrap malloc\fR, then
all calls to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR will call the function \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR
instead.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR will
call the real \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR function.
.Sp
You may wish to provide a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR function as well, so that
links without the \fB\-\-wrap\fR option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in the same
file as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR" 4
.IX Item "--eh-frame-hdr"

.PD
This linker can create the new dynamic tags in \s-1ELF\s0. But the older \s-1ELF\s0
systems may not understand them. If you specify
\&\fB\-\-enable\-new\-dtags\fR, the new dynamic tags will be created as needed
and older dynamic tags will be omitted.
If you specify \fB\-\-disable\-new\-dtags\fR, no new dynamic tags will be
created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created. Note that
those options are only available for \s-1ELF\s0 systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-hash\-size=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--hash-size=number"
Set the default size of the linker's hash tables to a prime number
close to \fInumber\fR.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of
time it takes the linker to perform its tasks, at the expense of
increasing the linker's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing this
value can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of speed.
.IP "\fB\-\-hash\-style=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "--hash-style=style"
Set the type of linker's hash table(s).  \fIstyle\fR can be either
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysv\*(C'\fR for classic \s-1ELF\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.hash\*(C'\fR section, \f(CW\*(C`gnu\*(C'\fR for
new style \s-1GNU\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.gnu.hash\*(C'\fR section or \f(CW\*(C`both\*(C'\fR for both
the classic \s-1ELF\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.hash\*(C'\fR and new style \s-1GNU\s0 \f(CW\*(C`.gnu.hash\*(C'\fR
hash tables.  The default is \f(CW\*(C`sysv\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-reduce\-memory\-overheads\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reduce-memory-overheads"
This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime, at the expense of
linking speed.  This was introduced to select the old O(n^2) algorithm
for link map file generation, rather than the new O(n) algorithm which uses
about 40% more memory for symbol storage.
.Sp
Another effect of the switch is to set the default hash table size to
1021, which again saves memory at the cost of lengthening the linker's
run time.  This is not done however if the \fB\-\-hash\-size\fR switch
has been used.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-reduce\-memory\-overheads\fR switch may be also be used to
enable other tradeoffs in future versions of the linker.

or a \f(CW\*(C`.build\-id\*(C'\fR \s-1COFF\s0 section.  The contents of the note are
unique bits identifying this linked file.  \fIstyle\fR can be
\&\f(CW\*(C`uuid\*(C'\fR to use 128 random bits, \f(CW\*(C`sha1\*(C'\fR to use a 160\-bit
\&\s-1SHA1\s0 hash on the normative parts of the output contents,
\&\f(CW\*(C`md5\*(C'\fR to use a 128\-bit \s-1MD5\s0 hash on the normative parts of

string specified as an even number of hexadecimal digits (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR characters between digit pairs are ignored).  If \fIstyle\fR
is omitted, \f(CW\*(C`sha1\*(C'\fR is used.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`md5\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`sha1\*(C'\fR styles produces an identifier
that is always the same in an identical output file, but will be
unique among all nonidentical output files.  It is not intended
to be compared as a checksum for the file's contents.  A linked
file may be changed later by other tools, but the build \s-1ID\s0 bit
string identifying the original linked file does not change.
.Sp
Passing \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR for \fIstyle\fR disables the setting from any
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-build\-id\*(C'\fR options earlier on the command line.
.PP
The i386 \s-1PE\s0 linker supports the \fB\-shared\fR option, which causes
the output to be a dynamically linked library (\s-1DLL\s0) instead of a
normal executable.  You should name the output \f(CW\*(C`*.dll\*(C'\fR when you
use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard
\&\f(CW\*(C`*.def\*(C'\fR files, which may be specified on the linker command line
like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal

The \s-1PE\s0 variants of the Coff object format add an extension that permits
the use of section names longer than eight characters, the normal limit
for Coff.  By default, these names are only allowed in object files, as
fully-linked executable images do not carry the Coff string table required
to support the longer names.  As a \s-1GNU\s0 extension, it is possible to
allow their use in executable images as well, or to (probably pointlessly!)
disallow it in object files, by using these two options.  Executable images
generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying
as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output when examined
with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers.  However,
\&\s-1GDB\s0 relies on the use of \s-1PE\s0 long section names to find Dwarf\-2 debug
information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if neither
option is specified on the command-line, \fBld\fR will enable long
section names, overriding the default and technically correct behaviour,
when it finds the presence of debug information while linking an executable
image and not stripping symbols.

If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do \*(L"fuzzy linking\*(R" by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_foo\*(C'\fR might be linked to the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`_foo@12\*(C'\fR, or the undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_bar@16\*(C'\fR might be linked
to the function \f(CW\*(C`_bar\*(C'\fR.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify \fB\-\-enable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this

[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-auto\-import\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-auto-import"
Do sophisticated linking of \f(CW\*(C`_symbol\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_imp_\|_symbol\*(C'\fR for
\&\s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when
building the import libraries with those \s-1DATA\s0 exports. Note: Use of the
\&'auto\-import' extension will cause the text section of the image file
to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format
specification published by Microsoft.
.Sp
Note \- use of the 'auto\-import' extension will also cause read only
data which would normally be placed into the .rdata section to be
placed into the .data section instead.  This is in order to work
around a problem with consts that is described here:
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004\-09/msg01101.html
.Sp
Using 'auto\-import' generally will 'just work' \*(-- but sometimes you may
see this message:
.Sp
"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the
documentation for ld's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-auto\-import\*(C'\fR for details."
.Sp
This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member
fields of struct variables imported from a \s-1DLL\s0, as well as using a
constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL\s0.  Any
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.
.Sp
There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:
.Sp
One way is to use \-\-enable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.
.Sp
A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable \*(--
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays,
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address)
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] \-\->
\&           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] \-\->
\&           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
.Ve
.Sp
For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern struct s extern_struct;
\&        extern_struct.field \-\->
\&           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t\->field }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern long long extern_ll;
\&        extern_ll \-\->
\&          { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }
.Ve
.Sp
A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
\&'auto\-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllimport)\*(C'\fR.  However, in practice that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a \s-1DLL\s0, building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL\s0, or
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:
.Sp
Original:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        \-\-foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        \-\-foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 1:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        \-\-foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        \-\-foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
\&          volatile int *parr = arr;
\&          printf("%d\en",parr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 2:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        \-\-foo.h
\&        /* Note: auto\-export is assumed (no _\|_declspec(dllexport)) */
\&        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(_\|_CYGWIN_\|_)) && \e
\&          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT _\|_declspec(dllimport)
\&        #else
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT
\&        #endif
\&        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
\&        \-\-foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. \fIset_foo()\fR and \fIget_foo()\fR accessor
functions).

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-insert\-timestamp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-insert-timestamp"
.PD
Insert a real timestamp into the image.  This is the default behaviour
as it matches legacy code and it means that the image will work with
other, proprietary tools.  The problem with this default is that it
will result in slightly different images being produced each tiem the
same sources are linked.  The option \fB\-\-no\-insert\-timestamp\fR
can be used to insert a zero value for the timestamp, this ensuring
that binaries produced from indentical sources will compare
identically.
.PP
The C6X uClinux target uses a binary format called \s-1DSBT\s0 to support shared

.IX Item "--dsbt-index index"
This option sets the \s-1DSBT\s0 index of the current executable or shared library
to \fIindex\fR.  The default is 0, which is appropriate for generating
executables.  If a shared library is generated with a \s-1DSBT\s0 index of 0, the

You can change the behaviour of \fBld\fR with the environment variables

\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \fB\-b\fR (or its synonym \fB\-\-format\fR).  Its value should be one
of the \s-1BFD\s0 names for an input format.  If there is no
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR in the environment, \fBld\fR uses the natural format
of the target. If \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR then \s-1BFD\s0
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files;
this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since
there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for
\&\s-1BFD\s0 on each system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR determines the default emulation if you don't use the
\&\fB\-m\fR option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker
behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the
available emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.  If
the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, and the \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment
variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.
.PP
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR is set in the environment, then it will
default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in
a similar fashion by the \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C'\fR linker wrapper program.  The default
may be overridden by the \fB\-\-demangle\fR and \fB\-\-no\-demangle\fR

\&\fBnlmconv\fR converts the relocatable \fBi386\fR object file
\&\fIinfile\fR into the NetWare Loadable Module \fIoutfile\fR, optionally
reading \fIheaderfile\fR for \s-1NLM\s0 header information.  For instructions
on writing the \s-1NLM\s0 command file language used in header files, see the
\&\fBlinkers\fR section, \fB\s-1NLMLINK\s0\fR in particular, of the \fI\s-1NLM\s0
Development and Tools Overview\fR, which is part of the \s-1NLM\s0 Software
Developer's Kit (\*(L"\s-1NLM\s0 \s-1SDK\s0\*(R"), available from Novell, Inc.
\&\fBnlmconv\fR uses the \s-1GNU\s0 Binary File Descriptor library to read
\&\fIinfile\fR;
.PP
\&\fBnlmconv\fR can perform a link step.  In other words, you can list
more than one object file for input if you list them in the definitions
file (rather than simply specifying one input file on the command line).
In this case, \fBnlmconv\fR calls the linker for you.

.PD
Object format of the output file.  \fBnlmconv\fR infers the output
format based on the input format, e.g. for a \fBi386\fR input file the
output format is \fBnlm32\-i386\fR.

Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBnm\fR lists the symbols from object files \fIobjfile\fR....
If no object files are listed as arguments, \fBnm\fR assumes the file
\&\fIa.out\fR.
.PP
For each symbol, \fBnm\fR shows:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The symbol value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or
hexadecimal by default.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The symbol type.  At least the following types are used; others are, as
well, depending on the object file format.  If lowercase, the symbol is
usually local; if uppercase, the symbol is global (external).  There
are however a few lowercase symbols that are shown for special global
symbols (\f(CW\*(C`u\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR).

The symbol is common.  Common symbols are uninitialized data.  When
linking, multiple common symbols may appear with the same name.  If the
symbol is defined anywhere, the common symbols are treated as undefined

The symbol is in an initialized data section for small objects.  Some
object file formats permit more efficient access to small data objects,
such as a global int variable as opposed to a large global array.
.ie n .IP """i""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWi\fR" 4
.IX Item "i"
For \s-1PE\s0 format files this indicates that the symbol is in a section
specific to the implementation of DLLs.  For \s-1ELF\s0 format files this
indicates that the symbol is an indirect function.  This is a \s-1GNU\s0
extension to the standard set of \s-1ELF\s0 symbol types.  It indicates a
symbol which if referenced by a relocation does not evaluate to its
address, but instead must be invoked at runtime.  The runtime
execution will then return the value to be used in the relocation.

The symbol is a unique global symbol.  This is a \s-1GNU\s0 extension to the
standard set of \s-1ELF\s0 symbol bindings.  For such a symbol the dynamic linker
will make sure that in the entire process there is just one symbol with
this name and type in use.

The symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined symbol is linked with
a normal defined symbol, the normal defined symbol is used with no error.
When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined,
the value of the weak symbol becomes zero with no error.  On some
systems, uppercase indicates that a default value has been specified.

The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been specifically tagged as a
weak object symbol.  When a weak defined symbol is linked with a normal
defined symbol, the normal defined symbol is used with no error.
When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined,
the value of the symbol is determined in a system-specific manner without
error.  On some systems, uppercase indicates that a default value has been
specified.

.IX Item "-C"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-demangle[=\fR\fIstyle\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--demangle[=style]"
.PD
Decode (\fIdemangle\fR) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
makes \*(C+ function names readable. Different compilers have different
mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to
choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-demangle\fR" 4

Do not demangle low-level symbol names.  This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dynamic"
.PD
Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.  This is
only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
libraries.

.IX Item "-f format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIformat\fR" 4

Use the output format \fIformat\fR, which can be \f(CW\*(C`bsd\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`sysv\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`posix\*(C'\fR.  The default is \f(CW\*(C`bsd\*(C'\fR.
Only the first character of \fIformat\fR is significant; it can be
either upper or lower case.

.IP "\fB\-\-line\-numbers\fR" 4
.IX Item "--line-numbers"
.PD
For each symbol, use debugging information to try to find a filename and
line number.  For a defined symbol, look for the line number of the
address of the symbol.  For an undefined symbol, look for the line
number of a relocation entry which refers to the symbol.  If line number
information can be found, print it after the other symbol information.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR" 4

.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sort\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sort"

Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print them in the order
encountered.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-portability\fR" 4
.IX Item "--portability"
.PD
Use the \s-1POSIX\s0.2 standard output format instead of the default format.
Equivalent to \fB\-f posix\fR.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-reverse\-sort\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-print\-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "--print-size"
.PD
Print both value and size of defined symbols for the \f(CW\*(C`bsd\*(C'\fR output style.
This option has no effect for object formats that do not record symbol
sizes, unless \fB\-\-size\-sort\fR is also used in which case a
calculated size is displayed.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-print\-armap\fR" 4
.IX Item "--print-armap"
.PD
When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a mapping
(stored in the archive by \fBar\fR or \fBranlib\fR) of which modules
contain definitions for which names.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fIradix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t radix"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-radix=\fR\fIradix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--radix=radix"
.PD
Use \fIradix\fR as the radix for printing the symbol values.  It must be
\&\fBd\fR for decimal, \fBo\fR for octal, or \fBx\fR for hexadecimal.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-undefined\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "--undefined-only"
.PD
Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object file).
.IP "\fB\-V\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
.PD
Show the version number of \fBnm\fR and exit.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X"
This option is ignored for compatibility with the \s-1AIX\s0 version of
\&\fBnm\fR.  It takes one parameter which must be the string
\&\fB32_64\fR.  The default mode of \s-1AIX\s0 \fBnm\fR corresponds
to \fB\-X 32\fR, which is not supported by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBnm\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-defined\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "--defined-only"
Display only defined symbols for each object file.
.IP "\fB\-\-plugin\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--plugin name"
Load the plugin called \fIname\fR to add support for extra target
types.  This option is only available if the toolchain has been built
with plugin support enabled.
.IP "\fB\-\-size\-sort\fR" 4
.IX Item "--size-sort"
Sort symbols by size.  The size is computed as the difference between
the value of the symbol and the value of the symbol with the next higher
value.  If the \f(CW\*(C`bsd\*(C'\fR output format is used the size of the symbol
is printed, rather than the value, and \fB\-S\fR must be used in order
both size and value to be printed.
.IP "\fB\-\-special\-syms\fR" 4
.IX Item "--special-syms"
Display symbols which have a target-specific special meaning.  These
symbols are usually used by the target for some special processing and
are not normally helpful when included in the normal symbol lists.
For example for \s-1ARM\s0 targets this option would skip the mapping symbols
used to mark transitions between \s-1ARM\s0 code, \s-1THUMB\s0 code and data.
.IP "\fB\-\-synthetic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--synthetic"
Include synthetic symbols in the output.  These are special symbols
created by the linker for various purposes.  They are not shown by
default since they are not part of the binary's original source code.
.IP "\fB\-\-target=\fR\fIbfdname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target=bfdname"
Specify an object code format other than your system's default format.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1GNU\s0 \fBobjcopy\fR utility copies the contents of an object
file to another.  \fBobjcopy\fR uses the \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1BFD\s0 Library to
read and write the object files.  It can write the destination object
file in a format different from that of the source object file.  The
exact behavior of \fBobjcopy\fR is controlled by command-line options.
Note that \fBobjcopy\fR should be able to copy a fully linked file
between any two formats. However, copying a relocatable object file
between any two formats may not work as expected.
.PP
\&\fBobjcopy\fR creates temporary files to do its translations and
deletes them afterward.  \fBobjcopy\fR uses \s-1BFD\s0 to do all its
translation work; it has access to all the formats described in \s-1BFD\s0
and thus is able to recognize most formats without being told
explicitly.
.PP
\&\fBobjcopy\fR can be used to generate S\-records by using an output
target of \fBsrec\fR (e.g., use \fB\-O srec\fR).
.PP
\&\fBobjcopy\fR can be used to generate a raw binary file by using an
output target of \fBbinary\fR (e.g., use \fB\-O binary\fR).  When
\&\fBobjcopy\fR generates a raw binary file, it will essentially produce
a memory dump of the contents of the input object file.  All symbols and
relocation information will be discarded.  The memory dump will start at
the load address of the lowest section copied into the output file.
.PP
When generating an S\-record or a raw binary file, it may be helpful to
use \fB\-S\fR to remove sections containing debugging information.  In
some cases \fB\-R\fR will be useful to remove sections which contain
information that is not needed by the binary file.
.PP
Note\-\-\-\fBobjcopy\fR is not able to change the endianness of its input
files.  If the input format has an endianness (some formats do not),
\&\fBobjcopy\fR can only copy the inputs into file formats that have the
same endianness or which have no endianness (e.g., \fBsrec\fR).
(However, see the \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes\fR option.)

.IX Item "--binary-architecture=bfdarch"
.PD
Useful when transforming a architecture-less input file into an object file.
In this case the output architecture can be set to \fIbfdarch\fR.  This
option will be ignored if the input file has a known \fIbfdarch\fR.  You
can access this binary data inside a program by referencing the special
symbols that are created by the conversion process.  These symbols are
called _binary_\fIobjfile\fR_start, _binary_\fIobjfile\fR_end and
_binary_\fIobjfile\fR_size.  e.g. you can transform a picture file into
an object file and then access it in your code using these symbols.

.IX Item "-j sectionpattern"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-only\-section=\fR\fIsectionpattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "--only-section=sectionpattern"
.PD
Copy only the indicated sections from the input file to the output file.
This option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option
inappropriately may make the output file unusable.  Wildcard
characters are accepted in \fIsectionpattern\fR.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-remove\-section=\fR\fIsectionpattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "--remove-section=sectionpattern"
.PD
Remove any section matching \fIsectionpattern\fR from the output file.
This option may be given more than once.  Note that using this option
inappropriately may make the output file unusable.  Wildcard
characters are accepted in \fIsectionpattern\fR.  Using both the
\&\fB\-j\fR and \fB\-R\fR options together results in undefined
behaviour.

.IP "\fB\-G\fR \fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G symbolname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-keep\-global\-symbol=\fR\fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--keep-global-symbol=symbolname"
.PD
Keep only symbol \fIsymbolname\fR global.  Make all other symbols local
to the file, so that they are not visible externally.  This option may
be given more than once.
.IP "\fB\-\-localize\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "--localize-hidden"
In an \s-1ELF\s0 object, mark all symbols that have hidden or internal visibility
as local.  This option applies on top of symbol-specific localization options
such as \fB\-L\fR.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR \fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L symbolname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-localize\-symbol=\fR\fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--localize-symbol=symbolname"

visible externally.  This option may be given more than once.
.IP "\fB\-W\fR \fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W symbolname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-weaken\-symbol=\fR\fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--weaken-symbol=symbolname"
.PD
Make symbol \fIsymbolname\fR weak. This option may be given more than once.
.IP "\fB\-\-globalize\-symbol=\fR\fIsymbolname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--globalize-symbol=symbolname"
Give symbol \fIsymbolname\fR global scoping so that it is visible
outside of the file in which it is defined.  This option may be given
more than once.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-wildcard\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wildcard"
.PD
Permit regular expressions in \fIsymbolname\fRs used in other command
line options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\e) and
square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the symbol
name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the exclamation
point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&          \-w \-W !foo \-W fo*
.Ve
.Sp
would cause objcopy to weaken all symbols that start with \*(L"fo\*(R"
except for the symbol \*(L"foo\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-x\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-discard\-all\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-discard\-locals\fR" 4

Do not copy compiler-generated local symbols.

.IX Item "-b byte"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-byte=\fR\fIbyte\fR" 4
.IX Item "--byte=byte"
.PD
If interleaving has been enabled via the \fB\-\-interleave\fR option
then start the range of bytes to keep at the \fIbyte\fRth byte.
\&\fIbyte\fR can be in the range from 0 to \fIbreadth\fR\-1, where
\&\fIbreadth\fR is the value given by the \fB\-\-interleave\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-i [\fR\fIbreadth\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i [breadth]"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-interleave[=\fR\fIbreadth\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--interleave[=breadth]"
.PD
Only copy a range out of every \fIbreadth\fR bytes.  (Header data is
not affected).  Select which byte in the range begins the copy with
the \fB\-\-byte\fR option.  Select the width of the range with the
\&\fB\-\-interleave\-width\fR option.
.Sp
This option is useful for creating files to program \s-1ROM\s0.  It is
typically used with an \f(CW\*(C`srec\*(C'\fR output target.  Note that
\&\fBobjcopy\fR will complain if you do not specify the
\&\fB\-\-byte\fR option as well.
.Sp
The default interleave breadth is 4, so with \fB\-\-byte\fR set to 0,
\&\fBobjcopy\fR would copy the first byte out of every four bytes
from the input to the output.
.IP "\fB\-\-interleave\-width=\fR\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "--interleave-width=width"
When used with the \fB\-\-interleave\fR option, copy \fIwidth\fR
bytes at a time.  The start of the range of bytes to be copied is set
by the \fB\-\-byte\fR option, and the extent of the range is set with
the \fB\-\-interleave\fR option.
.Sp
The default value for this option is 1.  The value of \fIwidth\fR plus
the \fIbyte\fR value set by the \fB\-\-byte\fR option must not exceed
the interleave breadth set by the \fB\-\-interleave\fR option.
.Sp
This option can be used to create images for two 16\-bit flashes interleaved
in a 32\-bit bus by passing \fB\-b 0 \-i 4 \-\-interleave\-width=2\fR
and \fB\-b 2 \-i 4 \-\-interleave\-width=2\fR to two \fBobjcopy\fR
commands.  If the input was '12345678' then the outputs would be
\&'1256' and '3478' respectively.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-preserve\-dates\fR" 4
.IX Item "--preserve-dates"
.PD
Set the access and modification dates of the output file to be the same
as those of the input file.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-deterministic-archives"
.PD
Operate in \fIdeterministic\fR mode.  When copying archive members
and writing the archive index, use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps,
and use consistent file modes for all files.
.Sp
If \fIbinutils\fR was configured with
\&\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR, then this mode is on by default.
It can be disabled with the \fB\-U\fR option, below.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-disable\-deterministic\-archives\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disable-deterministic-archives"
.PD
Do \fInot\fR operate in \fIdeterministic\fR mode.  This is the
inverse of the \fB\-D\fR option, above: when copying archive members
and writing the archive index, use their actual \s-1UID\s0, \s-1GID\s0, timestamp,
and file mode values.
.Sp
This is the default unless \fIbinutils\fR was configured with
\&\fB\-\-enable\-deterministic\-archives\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-debugging\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debugging"
Convert debugging information, if possible.  This is not the default
because only certain debugging formats are supported, and the
conversion process can be time consuming.
.IP "\fB\-\-gap\-fill\fR \fIval\fR" 4
.IX Item "--gap-fill val"
Fill gaps between sections with \fIval\fR.  This operation applies to
the \fIload address\fR (\s-1LMA\s0) of the sections.  It is done by increasing
the size of the section with the lower address, and filling in the extra
space created with \fIval\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-pad\-to\fR \fIaddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "--pad-to address"
Pad the output file up to the load address \fIaddress\fR.  This is
done by increasing the size of the last section.  The extra space is
filled in with the value specified by \fB\-\-gap\-fill\fR (default zero).
.IP "\fB\-\-set\-start\fR \fIval\fR" 4
.IX Item "--set-start val"
Set the start address of the new file to \fIval\fR.  Not all object file

for a section which does not have contents, but it is not meaningful
to clear the \fBcontents\fR flag of a section which does have
contents\*(--just remove the section instead.  Not all flags are
meaningful for all object file formats.

Add a new section named \fIsectionname\fR while copying the file.  The
contents of the new section are taken from the file \fIfilename\fR.  The
size of the section will be the size of the file.  This option only

Place the contents of section named \fIsectionname\fR into the file
\&\fIfilename\fR, overwriting any contents that may have been there
previously.  This option is the inverse of \fB\-\-add\-section\fR.
This option is similar to the \fB\-\-only\-section\fR option except
that it does not create a formatted file, it just dumps the contents
as raw binary data, without applying any relocations.  The option can
be specified more than once.

.IX Item "--rename-section oldname=newname[,flags]"
Rename a section from \fIoldname\fR to \fInewname\fR, optionally
changing the section's flags to \fIflags\fR in the process.  This has
the advantage over usng a linker script to perform the rename in that
the output stays as an object file and does not become a linked
executable.
.Sp
This option is particularly helpful when the input format is binary,
since this will always create a section called .data.  If for example,
you wanted instead to create a section called .rodata containing binary
data you could use the following command line to achieve it:
.Sp
.Vb 3

.IP "\fB\-\-long\-section\-names {enable,disable,keep}\fR" 4

Controls the handling of long section names when processing \f(CW\*(C`COFF\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`PE\-COFF\*(C'\fR object formats.  The default behaviour, \fBkeep\fR,
is to preserve long section names if any are present in the input file.
The \fBenable\fR and \fBdisable\fR options forcibly enable or disable
the use of long section names in the output object; when \fBdisable\fR
is in effect, any long section names in the input object will be truncated.
The \fBenable\fR option will only emit long section names if any are
present in the inputs; this is mostly the same as \fBkeep\fR, but it
is left undefined whether the \fBenable\fR option might force the
creation of an empty string table in the output file.
.IP "\fB\-\-change\-leading\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "--change-leading-char"
Some object file formats use special characters at the start of
symbols.  The most common such character is underscore, which compilers
often add before every symbol.  This option tells \fBobjcopy\fR to
change the leading character of every symbol when it converts between
object file formats.  If the object file formats use the same leading
character, this option has no effect.  Otherwise, it will add a
character, or remove a character, or change a character, as
appropriate.
.IP "\fB\-\-remove\-leading\-char\fR" 4
.IX Item "--remove-leading-char"
If the first character of a global symbol is a special symbol leading
character used by the object file format, remove the character.  The
most common symbol leading character is underscore.  This option will
remove a leading underscore from all global symbols.  This can be useful
if you want to link together objects of different file formats with
different conventions for symbol names.  This is different from
\&\fB\-\-change\-leading\-char\fR because it always changes the symbol name
when appropriate, regardless of the object file format of the output
file.
.IP "\fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reverse-bytes=num"
Reverse the bytes in a section with output contents.  A section length must
be evenly divisible by the value given in order for the swap to be able to
take place. Reversing takes place before the interleaving is performed.
.Sp
This option is used typically in generating \s-1ROM\s0 images for problematic
target systems.  For example, on some target boards, the 32\-bit words
fetched from 8\-bit ROMs are re-assembled in little-endian byte order
regardless of the \s-1CPU\s0 byte order.  Depending on the programming model, the
endianness of the \s-1ROM\s0 may need to be modified.
.Sp
Consider a simple file with a section containing the following eight
bytes:  \f(CW12345678\fR.
.Sp
Using \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=2\fR for the above example, the bytes in the
output file would be ordered \f(CW21436587\fR.
.Sp
Using \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=4\fR for the above example, the bytes in the
output file would be ordered \f(CW43218765\fR.
.Sp
By using \fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=2\fR for the above example, followed by
\&\fB\-\-reverse\-bytes=4\fR on the output file, the bytes in the second
output file would be ordered \f(CW34127856\fR.

character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBobjdump\fR displays information about one or more object files.
The options control what particular information to display.  This
information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
program to compile and work.
.PP
\&\fIobjfile\fR... are the object files to be examined.  When you
specify archives, \fBobjdump\fR shows information on each of the member
object files.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.  At least one option from the list
\&\fB\-a,\-d,\-D,\-e,\-f,\-g,\-G,\-h,\-H,\-p,\-P,\-r,\-R,\-s,\-S,\-t,\-T,\-V,\-x\fR must be given.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-archive\-header\fR" 4
.IX Item "--archive-header"
.PD
If any of the \fIobjfile\fR files are archives, display the archive
header information (in a format similar to \fBls \-l\fR).  Besides the
information you could list with \fBar tv\fR, \fBobjdump \-a\fR shows
the object file format of each archive member.
.IP "\fB\-\-adjust\-vma=\fR\fIoffset\fR" 4
.IX Item "--adjust-vma=offset"
When dumping information, first add \fIoffset\fR to all the section
addresses.  This is useful if the section addresses do not correspond to
the symbol table, which can happen when putting sections at particular
addresses when using a format which can not represent section addresses,
such as a.out.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIbfdname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b bfdname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-target=\fR\fIbfdname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target=bfdname"
.PD
Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
\&\fIbfdname\fR.  This option may not be necessary; \fIobjdump\fR can
automatically recognize many formats.
.Sp
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        objdump \-b oasys \-m vax \-h fu.o
.Ve
.Sp
displays summary information from the section headers (\fB\-h\fR) of
\&\fIfu.o\fR, which is explicitly identified (\fB\-m\fR) as a \s-1VAX\s0 object
file in the format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the
formats available with the \fB\-i\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-demangle[=\fR\fIstyle\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--demangle[=style]"
.PD
Decode (\fIdemangle\fR) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
makes \*(C+ function names readable.  Different compilers have different
mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to
choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-debugging\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debugging"
.PD
Display debugging information.  This attempts to parse \s-1STABS\s0 and \s-1IEEE\s0
debugging format information stored in the file and print it out using
a C like syntax.  If neither of these formats are found this option
falls back on the \fB\-W\fR option to print any \s-1DWARF\s0 information in
the file.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-debugging\-tags\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debugging-tags"
.PD
Like \fB\-g\fR, but the information is generated in a format compatible
with ctags tool.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-disassemble\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassemble"
.PD
Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine instructions from
\&\fIobjfile\fR.  This option only disassembles those sections which are
expected to contain instructions.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-disassemble\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassemble-all"
.PD
Like \fB\-d\fR, but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
those expected to contain instructions.
.Sp
If the target is an \s-1ARM\s0 architecture this switch also has the effect
of forcing the disassembler to decode pieces of data found in code
sections as if they were instructions.
.IP "\fB\-\-prefix\-addresses\fR" 4
.IX Item "--prefix-addresses"
When disassembling, print the complete address on each line.  This is
the older disassembly format.
.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
.IP "\fB\-\-endian={big|little}\fR" 4
.IX Item "--endian={big|little}"
.PD
Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects
disassembly.  This can be useful when disassembling a file format which
does not describe endianness information, such as S\-records.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-file\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file-headers"
.PD
Display summary information from the overall header of
each of the \fIobjfile\fR files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-file\-offsets\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file-offsets"
.PD
When disassembling sections, whenever a symbol is displayed, also
display the file offset of the region of data that is about to be
dumped.  If zeroes are being skipped, then when disassembly resumes,
tell the user how many zeroes were skipped and the file offset of the
location from where the disassembly resumes.  When dumping sections,
display the file offset of the location from where the dump starts.
.IP "\fB\-\-file\-start\-context\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file-start-context"
Specify that when displaying interlisted source code/disassembly
(assumes \fB\-S\fR) from a file that has not yet been displayed, extend the
context to the start of the file.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-section\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section-headers"
.IP "\fB\-\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "--headers"
.PD
Display summary information from the section headers of the
object file.
.Sp
File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses, for example by
using the \fB\-Ttext\fR, \fB\-Tdata\fR, or \fB\-Tbss\fR options to
\&\fBld\fR.  However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not
store the starting address of the file segments.  In those situations,
although \fBld\fR relocates the sections correctly, using \fBobjdump
\&\-h\fR to list the file section headers cannot show the correct addresses.
Instead, it shows the usual addresses, which are implicit for the
target.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
.PD
Print a summary of the options to \fBobjdump\fR and exit.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-info\fR" 4
.IX Item "--info"
.PD
Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available
for specification with \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-m\fR.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-j name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-section=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section=name"
.PD
Display information only for section \fIname\fR.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-line\-numbers\fR" 4
.IX Item "--line-numbers"
.PD
Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename and
source line numbers corresponding to the object code or relocs shown.
Only useful with \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-D\fR, or \fB\-r\fR.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m machine"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-architecture=\fR\fImachine\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=machine"
.PD
Specify the architecture to use when disassembling object files.  This
can be useful when disassembling object files which do not describe
architecture information, such as S\-records.  You can list the available
architectures with the \fB\-i\fR option.
.Sp
If the target is an \s-1ARM\s0 architecture then this switch has an
additional effect.  It restricts the disassembly to only those
instructions supported by the architecture specified by \fImachine\fR.
If it is necessary to use this switch because the input file does not
contain any architecture information, but it is also desired to
disassemble all the instructions use \fB\-marm\fR.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR \fIoptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M options"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-disassembler\-options=\fR\fIoptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassembler-options=options"
.PD
Pass target specific information to the disassembler.  Only supported on
some targets.  If it is necessary to specify more than one
disassembler option then multiple \fB\-M\fR options can be used or
can be placed together into a comma separated list.
.Sp
If the target is an \s-1ARM\s0 architecture then this switch can be used to
select which register name set is used during disassembler.  Specifying
\&\fB\-M reg-names-std\fR (the default) will select the register names as
used in \s-1ARM\s0's instruction set documentation, but with register 13 called
\&'sp', register 14 called 'lr' and register 15 called 'pc'.  Specifying
\&\fB\-M reg-names-apcs\fR will select the name set used by the \s-1ARM\s0
Procedure Call Standard, whilst specifying \fB\-M reg-names-raw\fR will
just use \fBr\fR followed by the register number.
.Sp
There are also two variants on the \s-1APCS\s0 register naming scheme enabled
by \fB\-M reg-names-atpcs\fR and \fB\-M reg-names-special-atpcs\fR which
use the ARM/Thumb Procedure Call Standard naming conventions.  (Either
with the normal register names or the special register names).
.Sp
This option can also be used for \s-1ARM\s0 architectures to force the
disassembler to interpret all instructions as Thumb instructions by
using the switch \fB\-\-disassembler\-options=force\-thumb\fR.  This can be
useful when attempting to disassemble thumb code produced by other
compilers.
.Sp
For the x86, some of the options duplicate functions of the \fB\-m\fR
switch, but allow finer grained control.  Multiple selections from the
following may be specified as a comma separated string.
\&\fBx86\-64\fR, \fBi386\fR and \fBi8086\fR select disassembly for
the given architecture.  \fBintel\fR and \fBatt\fR select between
intel syntax mode and \s-1AT&T\s0 syntax mode.
\&\fBintel-mnemonic\fR and \fBatt-mnemonic\fR select between
intel mnemonic mode and \s-1AT&T\s0 mnemonic mode. \fBintel-mnemonic\fR
implies \fBintel\fR and \fBatt-mnemonic\fR implies \fBatt\fR.
\&\fBaddr64\fR, \fBaddr32\fR,
\&\fBaddr16\fR, \fBdata32\fR and \fBdata16\fR specify the default
address size and operand size.  These four options will be overridden if
\&\fBx86\-64\fR, \fBi386\fR or \fBi8086\fR appear later in the
option string.  Lastly, \fBsuffix\fR, when in \s-1AT&T\s0 mode,
instructs the disassembler to print a mnemonic suffix even when the
suffix could be inferred by the operands.
.Sp
For PowerPC, \fBbooke\fR controls the disassembly of BookE
instructions.  \fB32\fR and \fB64\fR select PowerPC and
PowerPC64 disassembly, respectively.  \fBe300\fR selects
disassembly for the e300 family.  \fB440\fR selects disassembly for
the PowerPC 440.  \fBppcps\fR selects disassembly for the paired
single instructions of the \s-1PPC750CL\s0.
.Sp
For \s-1MIPS\s0, this option controls the printing of instruction mnemonic
names and register names in disassembled instructions.  Multiple
selections from the following may be specified as a comma separated
string, and invalid options are ignored:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """no\-aliases""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWno\-aliases\fR" 4
.IX Item "no-aliases"

For any of the options listed above, \fI\s-1ABI\s0\fR or
\&\fI\s-1ARCH\s0\fR may be specified as \fBnumeric\fR to have numbers printed
rather than names, for the selected types of registers.
You can list the available values of \fI\s-1ABI\s0\fR and \fI\s-1ARCH\s0\fR using
the \fB\-\-help\fR option.
.Sp
For \s-1VAX\s0, you can specify function entry addresses with \fB\-M
entry:0xf00ba\fR.  You can use this multiple times to properly
disassemble \s-1VAX\s0 binary files that don't contain symbol tables (like
\&\s-1ROM\s0 dumps).  In these cases, the function entry mask would otherwise
be decoded as \s-1VAX\s0 instructions, which would probably lead the rest
of the function being wrongly disassembled.

.IP "\fB\-\-dwarf\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dwarf-depth=n"
Limit the dump of the \f(CW\*(C`.debug_info\*(C'\fR section to \fIn\fR children.
This is only useful with \fB\-\-dwarf=info\fR.  The default is
to print all DIEs; the special value 0 for \fIn\fR will also have this
effect.
.Sp
With a non-zero value for \fIn\fR, DIEs at or deeper than \fIn\fR
levels will not be printed.  The range for \fIn\fR is zero-based.
.IP "\fB\-\-dwarf\-start=\fR\fIn\fR" 4

If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header
information and all DIEs before the \s-1DIE\s0 numbered \fIn\fR.  Only

Display the full contents of any sections requested.  Display the

\&\s-1ELF\s0 file.  This is only useful on systems (such as Solaris 2.0) in which
\&\f(CW\*(C`.stab\*(C'\fR debugging symbol-table entries are carried in an \s-1ELF\s0
section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table entries are
interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in the \fB\-\-syms\fR
output.
.IP "\fB\-\-start\-address=\fR\fIaddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "--start-address=address"
Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
of the \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-r\fR and \fB\-s\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-\-stop\-address=\fR\fIaddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stop-address=address"

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-syms\fR" 4
.IX Item "--syms"
.PD
Print the symbol table entries of the file.
This is similar to the information provided by the \fBnm\fR program,
although the display format is different.  The format of the output
depends upon the format of the file being dumped, but there are two main
types.  One looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        [  4](sec  3)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   3) (nx 1) 0x00000000 .bss
\&        [  6](sec  1)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   2) (nx 0) 0x00000000 fred
.Ve
.Sp
where the number inside the square brackets is the number of the entry
in the symbol table, the \fIsec\fR number is the section number, the
\&\fIfl\fR value are the symbol's flag bits, the \fIty\fR number is the
symbol's type, the \fIscl\fR number is the symbol's storage class and
the \fInx\fR value is the number of auxilary entries associated with
the symbol.  The last two fields are the symbol's value and its name.
.Sp
The other common output format, usually seen with \s-1ELF\s0 based files,
looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        00000000 l    d  .bss   00000000 .bss
\&        00000000 g       .text  00000000 fred
.Ve
.Sp
Here the first number is the symbol's value (sometimes refered to as
its address).  The next field is actually a set of characters and
spaces indicating the flag bits that are set on the symbol.  These
characters are described below.  Next is the section with which the
symbol is associated or \fI*ABS*\fR if the section is absolute (ie
not connected with any section), or \fI*UND*\fR if the section is
referenced in the file being dumped, but not defined there.
.Sp
After the section name comes another field, a number, which for common
symbols is the alignment and for other symbol is the size.  Finally
the symbol's name is displayed.
.Sp
The flag characters are divided into 7 groups as follows:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """l""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWl\fR" 4
.IX Item "l"

.IX Item "u"
.ie n .IP """!""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW!\fR" 4
.IX Item "!"
.PD
The symbol is a local (l), global (g), unique global (u), neither
global nor local (a space) or both global and local (!).  A
symbol can be neither local or global for a variety of reasons, e.g.,
because it is used for debugging, but it is probably an indication of
a bug if it is ever both local and global.  Unique global symbols are
a \s-1GNU\s0 extension to the standard set of \s-1ELF\s0 symbol bindings.  For such
a symbol the dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process
there is just one symbol with this name and type in use.
.ie n .IP """w""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWw\fR" 4
.IX Item "w"
The symbol is weak (w) or strong (a space).
.ie n .IP """C""" 4

.ie n .IP """W""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWW\fR" 4

The symbol is a warning (W) or a normal symbol (a space).  A warning
symbol's name is a message to be displayed if the symbol following the
warning symbol is ever referenced.

.IX Item "I"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP """i""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWi\fR" 4

literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBranlib\fR generates an index to the contents of an archive and
stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a
member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.
.PP
You may use \fBnm \-s\fR or \fBnm \-\-print\-armap\fR to list this index.
.PP
An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 \fBranlib\fR program is another form of \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR; running
\&\fBranlib\fR is completely equivalent to executing \fBar \-s\fR.

inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

\&\fBreadelf\fR displays information about one or more \s-1ELF\s0 format object
files.  The options control what particular information to display.
.PP
\&\fIelffile\fR... are the object files to be examined.  32\-bit and
64\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 files are supported, as are archives containing \s-1ELF\s0 files.
.PP
This program performs a similar function to \fBobjdump\fR but it
goes into more detail and it exists independently of the \s-1BFD\s0
library, so if there is a bug in \s-1BFD\s0 then readelf will not be
affected.

.PD
Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are
present.  If one of the optional letters or words follows the switch
then only data found in those specific sections will be dumped.
.Sp
Note that there is no single letter option to display the content of
trace sections or .gdb_index.
.Sp
Note: the \fB=decodedline\fR option will display the interpreted
contents of a .debug_line section whereas the \fB=rawline\fR option
dumps the contents in a raw format.
.Sp
Note: the \fB=frames\-interp\fR option will display the interpreted
contents of a .debug_frame section whereas the \fB=frames\fR option
dumps the contents in a raw format.
.Sp
Note: the output from the \fB=info\fR option can also be affected
by the options \fB\-\-dwarf\-depth\fR and \fB\-\-dwarf\-start\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-dwarf\-depth=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dwarf-depth=n"
Limit the dump of the \f(CW\*(C`.debug_info\*(C'\fR section to \fIn\fR children.
This is only useful with \fB\-\-debug\-dump=info\fR.  The default is
to print all DIEs; the special value 0 for \fIn\fR will also have this
effect.
.Sp
With a non-zero value for \fIn\fR, DIEs at or deeper than \fIn\fR
levels will not be printed.  The range for \fIn\fR is zero-based.
.IP "\fB\-\-dwarf\-start=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dwarf-start=n"
Print only DIEs beginning with the \s-1DIE\s0 numbered \fIn\fR.  This is only
useful with \fB\-\-debug\-dump=info\fR.
.Sp
If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header
information and all DIEs before the \s-1DIE\s0 numbered \fIn\fR.  Only
siblings and children of the specified \s-1DIE\s0 will be printed.
.Sp
This can be used in conjunction with \fB\-\-dwarf\-depth\fR.

Don't break output lines to fit into 80 columns. By default
\&\fBreadelf\fR breaks section header and segment listing lines for
64\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 files, so that they fit into 80 columns. This option causes
\&\fBreadelf\fR to print each section header resp. each segment one a
single line, which is far more readable on terminals wider than 80 columns.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H"
.PD 0

.PD

Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included

.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1GNU\s0 \fBsize\fR utility lists the section sizes\-\-\-and the total
size\-\-\-for each of the object or archive files \fIobjfile\fR in its
argument list.  By default, one line of output is generated for each
object file or each module in an archive.
.PP
\&\fIobjfile\fR... are the object files to be examined.
If none are specified, the file \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR will be used.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The command line options have the following meanings:
.IP "\fB\-A\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-B\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B"
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIcompatibility\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=compatibility"
.PD
Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBsize\fR resembles output from System V \fBsize\fR (using \fB\-A\fR,
or \fB\-\-format=sysv\fR), or Berkeley \fBsize\fR (using \fB\-B\fR, or
\&\fB\-\-format=berkeley\fR).  The default is the one-line format similar to
Berkeley's.
.Sp
Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from
\&\fBsize\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        $ size \-\-format=Berkeley ranlib size

.Sp
This is the same data, but displayed closer to System V conventions:

.IX Item "-o"
.IP "\fB\-x\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x"
.IP "\fB\-\-radix=\fR\fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--radix=number"
.PD
Using one of these options, you can control whether the size of each
section is given in decimal (\fB\-d\fR, or \fB\-\-radix=10\fR); octal
(\fB\-o\fR, or \fB\-\-radix=8\fR); or hexadecimal (\fB\-x\fR, or
\&\fB\-\-radix=16\fR).  In \fB\-\-radix=\fR\fInumber\fR, only the three
values (8, 10, 16) are supported.  The total size is always given in two
radices; decimal and hexadecimal for \fB\-d\fR or \fB\-x\fR output, or
octal and hexadecimal if you're using \fB\-o\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "--common"
Print total size of common symbols in each file.  When using Berkeley
format these are included in the bss size.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-totals\fR" 4
.IX Item "--totals"
.PD
Show totals of all objects listed (Berkeley format listing mode only).

.IX Item "--target=bfdname"
Specify that the object-code format for \fIobjfile\fR is
\&\fIbfdname\fR.  This option may not be necessary; \fBsize\fR can
automatically recognize many formats.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V"

.IX Item "--version"
.PD
Display the version number of \fBsize\fR.

inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

Permit regular expressions in \fIsymbolname\fRs used in other command
line options.  The question mark (?), asterisk (*), backslash (\e) and
square brackets ([]) operators can be used anywhere in the symbol
name.  If the first character of the symbol name is the exclamation
point (!) then the sense of the switch is reversed for that symbol.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&          \-w \-K !foo \-K fo*
.Ve
.Sp
would cause strip to only keep symbols that start with the letters
\&\*(L"fo\*(R", but to discard the symbol \*(L"foo\*(R".

.IX Item "--keep-file-symbols"
When stripping a file, perhaps with \fB\-\-strip\-debug\fR or
\&\fB\-\-strip\-unneeded\fR, retain any symbols specifying source file names,
which would otherwise get stripped.
.IP "\fB\-\-only\-keep\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "--only-keep-debug"
Strip a file, removing contents of any sections that would not be
stripped by \fB\-\-strip\-debug\fR and leaving the debugging sections
intact.  In \s-1ELF\s0 files, this preserves all note sections in the output.
.Sp
The intention is that this option will be used in conjunction with
\&\fB\-\-add\-gnu\-debuglink\fR to create a two part executable.  One a
stripped binary which will occupy less space in \s-1RAM\s0 and in a
distribution and the second a debugging information file which is only
needed if debugging abilities are required.  The suggested procedure
to create these files is as follows:

create a file containing the debugging info.

.RE

Note\-\-\-the choice of \f(CW\*(C`.dbg\*(C'\fR as an extension for the debug info
file is arbitrary.  Also the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-only\-keep\-debug\*(C'\fR step is
optional.  You could instead do this:

.RE
.RS 4
.PD
.Sp
i.e., the file pointed to by the \fB\-\-add\-gnu\-debuglink\fR can be the
full executable.  It does not have to be a file created by the
\&\fB\-\-only\-keep\-debug\fR switch.
.Sp
Note\-\-\-this switch is only intended for use on fully linked files.  It
does not make sense to use it on object files where the debugging
information may be incomplete.  Besides the gnu_debuglink feature
currently only supports the presence of one filename containing
debugging information, not multiple filenames on a one-per-object-file
basis.

Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are

does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.

windres [options] [input\-file] [output\-file]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBwindres\fR reads resources from an input file and copies them into
an output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:
.ie n .IP """rc""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWrc\fR" 4
.IX Item "rc"
A text format read by the Resource Compiler.
.ie n .IP """res""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWres\fR" 4
.IX Item "res"
A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.
.ie n .IP """coff""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWcoff\fR" 4
.IX Item "coff"
A \s-1COFF\s0 object or executable.
.PP
The exact description of these different formats is available in
documentation from Microsoft.
.PP
When \fBwindres\fR converts from the \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR format to the \f(CW\*(C`res\*(C'\fR
format, it is acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When
\&\fBwindres\fR converts from the \f(CW\*(C`res\*(C'\fR format to the \f(CW\*(C`coff\*(C'\fR
format, it is acting like the Windows \f(CW\*(C`CVTRES\*(C'\fR program.
.PP
When \fBwindres\fR generates an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file, the output is similar
but not identical to the format expected for the input.  When an input
\&\f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file refers to an external filename, an output \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file
will instead include the file contents.
.PP
If the input or output format is not specified, \fBwindres\fR will
guess based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file contents.
A file with an extension of \fI.rc\fR will be treated as an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR
file, a file with an extension of \fI.res\fR will be treated as a
\&\f(CW\*(C`res\*(C'\fR file, and a file with an extension of \fI.o\fR or
\&\fI.exe\fR will be treated as a \f(CW\*(C`coff\*(C'\fR file.
.PP
If no output file is specified, \fBwindres\fR will print the resources
in \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR format to standard output.
.PP
The normal use is for you to write an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file, use \fBwindres\fR
to convert it to a \s-1COFF\s0 object file, and then link the \s-1COFF\s0 file into
your application.  This will make the resources described in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file available to Windows.

.IP "\fB\-\-input\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--input filename"
.PD
The name of the input file.  If this option is not used, then
\&\fBwindres\fR will use the first non-option argument as the input file
name.  If there are no non-option arguments, then \fBwindres\fR will
read from standard input.  \fBwindres\fR can not read a \s-1COFF\s0 file from
standard input.

.IX Item "-o filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output filename"
.PD
The name of the output file.  If this option is not used, then
\&\fBwindres\fR will use the first non-option argument, after any used
for the input file name, as the output file name.  If there is no
non-option argument, then \fBwindres\fR will write to standard output.
\&\fBwindres\fR can not write a \s-1COFF\s0 file to standard output.  Note,
for compatibility with \fBrc\fR the option \fB\-fo\fR is also
accepted, but its use is not recommended.

.IX Item "-J format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-input\-format\fR \fIformat\fR" 4

.PD
The input format to read.  \fIformat\fR may be \fBres\fR, \fBrc\fR, or
\&\fBcoff\fR.  If no input format is specified, \fBwindres\fR will
guess, as described above.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR \fIformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-format\fR \fIformat\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-format format"

\&\fBwindres\fR will guess, as described above.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F target"

Specify the \s-1BFD\s0 format to use for a \s-1COFF\s0 file as input or output.  This
is a \s-1BFD\s0 target name; you can use the \fB\-\-help\fR option to see a list
of supported targets.  Normally \fBwindres\fR will use the default
format, which is the first one listed by the \fB\-\-help\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-\-preprocessor\fR \fIprogram\fR" 4
.IX Item "--preprocessor program"
When \fBwindres\fR reads an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file, it runs it through the C
preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify the preprocessor
to use, including any leading arguments.  The default preprocessor
argument is \f(CW\*(C`gcc \-E \-xc\-header \-DRC_INVOKED\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-preprocessor\-arg\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "--preprocessor-arg option"
When \fBwindres\fR reads an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file, it runs it through
the C preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify additional
text to be passed to preprocessor on its command line.
This option can be used multiple times to add multiple options to the
preprocessor command line.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I directory"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-include\-dir\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "--include-dir directory"
.PD
Specify an include directory to use when reading an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file.
\&\fBwindres\fR will pass this to the preprocessor as an \fB\-I\fR
option.  \fBwindres\fR will also search this directory when looking for
files named in the \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file.  If the argument passed to this command
matches any of the supported \fIformats\fR (as described in the \fB\-J\fR
option), it will issue a deprecation warning, and behave just like the
\&\fB\-J\fR option.  New programs should not use this behaviour.  If a
directory happens to match a \fIformat\fR, simple prefix it with \fB./\fR
to disable the backward compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fItarget\fR" 4

.IX Item "-U target"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-undefine\fR \fIsym\fR" 4
.IX Item "--undefine sym"
.PD
Specify a \fB\-U\fR option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an

.IP "\fB\-r\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r"
Ignored for compatibility with rc.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4

.IX Item "-c val"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-codepage\fR \fIval\fR" 4
.IX Item "--codepage val"
.PD
Specify the default codepage to use when reading an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file.
\&\fIval\fR should be a hexadecimal prefixed by \fB0x\fR or decimal
codepage code. The valid range is from zero up to 0xffff, but the
validity of the codepage is host and configuration dependent.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIval\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l val"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-language\fR \fIval\fR" 4
.IX Item "--language val"
.PD
Specify the default language to use when reading an \f(CW\*(C`rc\*(C'\fR file.
\&\fIval\fR should be a hexadecimal language code.  The low eight bits are
the language, and the high eight bits are the sublanguage.
.IP "\fB\-\-use\-temp\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--use-temp-file"
Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read the output of
the preprocessor. Use this option if the popen implementation is buggy
on the host (eg., certain non-English language versions of Windows 95 and
Windows 98 are known to have buggy popen where the output will instead
go the console).
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-use\-temp\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-use-temp-file"
Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of the preprocessor.
This is the default behaviour.

If \fBwindres\fR is compiled with \f(CW\*(C`YYDEBUG\*(C'\fR defined as \f(CW1\fR,
this will turn on parser debugging.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are

does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire

.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "Funding Free Software"
.IX Subsection "Funding Free Software"
If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.
.PP
Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers\-\-\-the Free Software Foundation, and others.
.PP
The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors
they must compete to be the one who gives the most.
.PP
To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, \*(L"We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold.\*(R"  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
\&\*(L"A portion of the profits are donated,\*(R" since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.
.PP
Even a precise fraction \*(L"of the profits from this disk\*(R" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.
If the price you pay is \f(CW$50\fR, ten percent of the profit is probably
less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.
.PP
Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;
but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new \s-1CPU\s0 to the \s-1GNU\s0 Compiler Collection contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.
.PP
By establishing the idea that supporting further development is \*(L"the
proper thing to do\*(R" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

.SS "Preamble"
.IX Subsection "Preamble"
The \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
.PP
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program\*(--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.
.PP
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
.PP
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.
.PP
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.
.PP
Developers that use the \s-1GNU GPL\s0 protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
.PP
For the developers' and authors' protection, the \s-1GPL\s0 clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the \s-1GPL\s0 requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
.PP
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the \s-1GPL\s0 to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the \s-1GPL,\s0 as needed to protect the
freedom of users.
.PP
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the \s-1GPL\s0
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
.PP
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
.SS "\s-1TERMS AND CONDITIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
.IP "0. Definitions." 4
.IX Item "0. Definitions."
\&\*(L"This License\*(R" refers to version 3 of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License.
.Sp
\&\*(L"Copyright\*(R" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.
.Sp
\&\*(L"The Program\*(R" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as \*(L"you\*(R".  \*(L"Licensees\*(R" and
\&\*(L"recipients\*(R" may be individuals or organizations.
.Sp
To \*(L"modify\*(R" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \*(L"modified version\*(R" of
the earlier work or a work \*(L"based on\*(R" the earlier work.
.Sp
A \*(L"covered work\*(R" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
.Sp
To \*(L"propagate\*(R" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
.Sp
To \*(L"convey\*(R" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.
.Sp
An interactive user interface displays \*(L"Appropriate Legal Notices\*(R" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
.IP "1. Source Code." 4
.IX Item "1. Source Code."
The \*(L"source code\*(R" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  \*(L"Object code\*(R" means any non-source form
of a work.
.Sp
A \*(L"Standard Interface\*(R" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
.Sp
The \*(L"System Libraries\*(R" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
\&\*(L"Major Component\*(R", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
.Sp
The \*(L"Corresponding Source\*(R" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
.Sp
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
.Sp
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.
.IP "2. Basic Permissions." 4
.IX Item "2. Basic Permissions."
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
.Sp
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
.Sp
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
.IP "3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law." 4
.IX Item "3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law."
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the \s-1WIPO\s0 copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
.Sp
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.
.IP "4. Conveying Verbatim Copies." 4
.IX Item "4. Conveying Verbatim Copies."
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
.Sp
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
.IP "5. Conveying Modified Source Versions." 4
.IX Item "5. Conveying Modified Source Versions."
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
.RS 4
.IP "a." 4
.IX Item "a."
The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.
.IP "b." 4
.IX Item "b."
The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \*(L"keep intact all
notices\*(R".
.IP "c." 4
.IX Item "c."
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.
.IP "d." 4
.IX Item "d."
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
\&\*(L"aggregate\*(R" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
.RE
.IP "6. Conveying Non-Source Forms." 4
.IX Item "6. Conveying Non-Source Forms."
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:
.RS 4
.IP "a." 4
.IX Item "a."
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.
.IP "b." 4
.IX Item "b."
Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
.IP "c." 4
.IX Item "c."
Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.
.IP "d." 4
.IX Item "d."
Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.
.IP "e." 4
.IX Item "e."
Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
.Sp
A \*(L"User Product\*(R" is either (1) a \*(L"consumer product\*(R", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
\&\*(L"normally used\*(R" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.
.Sp
\&\*(L"Installation Information\*(R" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.
.Sp
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in \s-1ROM\s0).
.Sp
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.
.Sp
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
.RE
.IP "7. Additional Terms." 4
.IX Item "7. Additional Terms."
\&\*(L"Additional permissions\*(R" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
.Sp
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
.Sp
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
.RS 4
.IP "a." 4
.IX Item "a."
Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
.IP "b." 4
.IX Item "b."
Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or
.IP "c." 4
.IX Item "c."
Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
.IP "d." 4
.IX Item "d."
Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or
.IP "e." 4
.IX Item "e."
Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or
.IP "f." 4
.IX Item "f."
Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \*(L"further
restrictions\*(R" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
.Sp
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
.Sp
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.
.RE
.IP "8. Termination." 4
.IX Item "8. Termination."
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
.Sp
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
.Sp
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
.Sp
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
.IP "9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies." 4
.IX Item "9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies."
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
.IP "10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients." 4
.IX Item "10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients."
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
.Sp
An \*(L"entity transaction\*(R" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
.Sp
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
.IP "11. Patents." 4
.IX Item "11. Patents."
A \*(L"contributor\*(R" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's \*(L"contributor version\*(R".
.Sp
A contributor's \*(L"essential patent claims\*(R" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, \*(L"control\*(R" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
.Sp
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
.Sp
In the following three paragraphs, a \*(L"patent license\*(R" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To \*(L"grant\*(R" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
.Sp
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  \*(L"Knowingly relying\*(R" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
.Sp
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
.Sp
A patent license is \*(L"discriminatory\*(R" if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
.IP "12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom." 4
.IX Item "12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom."
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.
.IP "13. Use with the \s-1GNU\s0 Affero General Public License." 4
.IX Item "13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License."
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the \s-1GNU\s0 Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the \s-1GNU\s0 Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
.IP "14. Revised Versions of this License." 4
.IX Item "14. Revised Versions of this License."
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
.Sp
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public
License \*(L"or any later version\*(R" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the \s-1GNU\s0 General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
.Sp
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.
.Sp
Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
.IP "15. Disclaimer of Warranty." 4
.IX Item "15. Disclaimer of Warranty."
\&\s-1THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \*(L"AS IS\*(R" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.\s0
.IP "16. Limitation of Liability." 4
.IX Item "16. Limitation of Liability."
\&\s-1IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM \s0(\s-1INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS\s0), \s-1EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\s0
.IP "17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16." 4
.IX Item "17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16."
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
.SS "\s-1END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"
.SS "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs"
.IX Subsection "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs"
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
.PP
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the \*(L"copyright\*(R" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        <one line to give the program\*(Aqs name and a brief idea of what it does.>  
\&        Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
\&        
\&        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
\&        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
\&        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
\&        your option) any later version.
\&        
\&        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
\&        WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\&        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
\&        General Public License for more details.
\&        
\&        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
\&        along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
.Ve
.PP
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
.PP
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
\&        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type "show w".
\&        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
\&        under certain conditions; type "show c" for details.
.Ve
.PP
The hypothetical commands \fBshow w\fR and \fBshow c\fR should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a \s-1GUI\s0 interface, you would
use an \*(L"about box\*(R".
.PP
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a \*(L"copyright disclaimer\*(R" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the \s-1GNU GPL,\s0 see
<\fBhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/\fR>.
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the \s-1GNU\s0 Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But
first, please read <\fBhttp://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why\-not\-lgpl.html\fR>.
